        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has formally withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify, following the disclosure of his significant health challenges. Mueller's family confirmed to The New York Times that he is battling Parkinson's disease, a debilitating condition that regrettably prevents his appearance before Congress. Chairman James Comer had originally sought Mueller's crucial testimony as part of the committee's extensive investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, particularly concerning the FBI's actions during Mueller's tenure as director from 2001 to 2013, a period when Epstein was under federal scrutiny. This development forces a considerable recalibration of the committee's investigative strategy, acknowledging the former FBI chief's profound inability to contribute directly to their ongoing, high-stakes inquiry.</p>

          <p>Representative Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) offered a sharp, sarcastic critique of supporters wearing Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" hats, suggesting they are shielded from facts. Her comments followed Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's assertion that Trump "objectively" behaves like a Russian asset, strategically favoring the Russian Federation. Crockett, known for her outspokenness, claimed that the red hats prevent wearers from processing factual information. This article also references her previous social media remarks where she labeled Trump's online trolls as "mentally ill" and "grade A losers," highlighting her confrontational stance against his base.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border late Sunday, resulting in widespread destruction and a significant loss of life. Officials reported at least 250 fatalities and 500 injuries, with numbers expected to rise as rescue teams access remote affected regions, including several villages in Kunar province that were largely destroyed. The shallow quake, followed by strong aftershocks, shook buildings as far as Kabul and Islamabad, highlighting the region's vulnerability to seismic activity. This tragic event marks one of the deadliest natural disasters in Afghanistan's recent history, prompting urgent rescue and relief efforts.</p>

Superintendent Brett Kahan warned that harboring or assisting Freeman constitutes an "extremely serious crime," as the massive manhunt continues through thick bushland. The incident has reignited concerns over how Australian authorities address threats from conspiracy theorists, particularly individuals espousing "sovereign citizen" views with documented anti-authority sentiments.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce stricter rules for migrants granted asylum who wish to bring their families to the UK, aiming to align with European policy changes. The proposed criteria include tougher English language standards and requirements for sufficient funds, alongside reforms to the asylum appeals system. Cooper emphasized that these measures are part of an overhaul to a "broken" asylum system, intended to end the controversial use of hotels for newly arrived migrants. The government also highlighted record efforts by the National Crime Agency in disrupting people-smuggling networks, with initial deportations to France expected soon under a new returns deal.</p>

          <p>Preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center indicates that over 1.2 million immigrants have exited the U.S. labor force from January to July, encompassing both undocumented and legal residents. This decline coincides with President Donald Trump's intensified immigration policies and a decrease in the overall immigrant population. Experts, including labor economists, suggest that the reduction in immigrant workers, who comprise nearly 20% of the U.S. workforce and are crucial in sectors like farming and construction, is significantly impacting job growth. Concerns are rising about potential labor shortages in vital industries, including healthcare, as immigration enforcement actions create fear and disrupt established labor supplies.</p>

The piece draws parallels with escalating U.S. immigration enforcement under Donald Trump, where militarization of borders and expanded definitions of "criminality" lead to fear among all immigrants.

Jens Spahn and Matthias Miersch held talks with Ukrainian authorities, reaffirming Germany's commitment to military support and diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin, while attending the SCO summit, reiterated his unsubstantiated claims about the war's origins and mentioned "understandings" from a previous meeting with Donald Trump, despite no ceasefire agreement. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed that ending the war at Ukraine's expense is not an option, indicating a prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott shared his unsurprised reaction to teammate Micah Parsons' blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers, which made Parsons the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback. Prescott indicated that the negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had seemingly become personal, making the eventual trade a foreseeable outcome despite initial shock. He expressed relief that a solution was reached, preventing ongoing distractions for the team. The Cowboys acquired two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark in exchange for Parsons, who will now face his former team in Week 4.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly ordered state security for former Vice President Kamala Harris, following President Donald Trump's revocation of her extended Secret Service protection. Trump's action, just weeks before Harris's book tour, ended the 18-month extension granted by Joe Biden due to perceived threats. Newsom's office cited the need to protect public officials from "erratic, vindictive political impulses," with the California Highway Patrol and LAPD stepping in to provide security. This move marks the latest political battle between Newsom and Trump, highlighting ongoing tensions and concerns over the safety of former high-ranking officials.</p>

The Pershing County Sheriff's Office confirmed the man's death and stated that his body was transported for examination, though no cause of death or suspects have been identified yet. Officials emphasized that while it appears to be a singular crime, festival participants should remain vigilant, acknowledging the complexity of investigating a crime in a temporary city that will soon disappear.</p>

          <p>A new book about the Royal Family, "Power and the Palace" by Valentine Low, reveals that Queen Camilla fought off an attempted sexual assault as a teenager using her shoe. The incident reportedly occurred on a train to Paddington Station when she was 16 or 17 years old, a story she later recounted to Boris Johnson. Upon arriving in London, she reported the incident, leading to the man's arrest. While Buckingham Palace has not officially commented, it is not disputing the account. Much of Queen Camilla's recent public work has focused on supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, advocating for courage and destigmatization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's effort to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without proper legal process. The ruling came just hours after lawyers alerted the court to a hurried government plan to send hundreds of children back to Guatemala, with planes already prepared for departure. U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan expanded an initial order to cover all unaccompanied children at risk, demanding that planes on the ground return children to Health and Human Services custody. Advocacy groups argue this action violates federal laws designed to protect migrant minors, citing potential risks of abuse or persecution upon return.</p>

          <p>The Guatemalan government has stated that it proposed the return of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children from the U.S. to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in July, aiming to reunite children with their families and integrate them into social programs. This statement followed a federal judge's decision to temporarily block the U.S. from deporting these children. The government asserts that all actions prioritize the children's human rights and comply with due process, despite attorneys for the children disputing these claims, citing potential violations of federal laws and the U.S. Constitution. The article also notes a factual error in Guatemala's timeline regarding Noem's visit, adding complexity to the official narrative.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal that Vietnam has significantly expanded its military footprint across 21 features in the contested Spratly Islands, surpassing China in land reclamation efforts. The US think tank CSIS reported that infrastructure, including munitions storage, is now taking shape on reefs that were previously only small pillboxes. This ongoing work signals Vietnam's determination to solidify its territorial claims in the South China Sea, a region also claimed by China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei. Maritime analysts suggest these actions, while unlikely to drastically alter the strategic balance, could prompt Beijing to upgrade its own defense posture in response, escalating regional tensions.</p>
