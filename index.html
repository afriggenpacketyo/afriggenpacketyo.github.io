        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed $90,000 for the first time since March, driven by investors seeking an alternative to a weakening dollar and volatile stock market. The cryptocurrency's rise coincides with renewed pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Bitcoin's recent performance shows signs of decoupling from risk assets, outperforming gold in April, and U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin saw substantial inflows. While analysts note light trading volumes, long-term holders and strategic buying are expected to support bitcoin's resilience amid market volatility (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decrease by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's China tariffs, impacting retailers like Temu and Shien who may reduce their Facebook and Instagram ad spending. Meta's China revenue was $18.35 billion in 2024, comprising over 11% of total sales, and analysts believe Temu and Shien significantly contribute to this. A prolonged economic downturn combined with trade tensions could further reduce Meta's 2025 ad revenues by $23 billion, potentially crushing earnings by 25%. MoffettNathanson maintains a Buy rating on Meta but decreased their target price to $525.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he does not believe transgender women are women, aligning with the Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' as biological sex under equalities law. This marks a shift from his previous stance and has sparked debate within the Labour Party, with some members expressing concern over potential backsliding on trans rights commitments. The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have an automatic right to access women-only spaces, allowing for exclusion if deemed proportionate. Starmer emphasized the need for guidance to reflect the court's judgment, affirming that transgender individuals should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's repeated criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has raised concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve and potential attempts to influence monetary policy. Economists suggest that even firing Powell may not be enough to achieve Trump's desired rate cuts, as the FOMC could still resist pressure to ease policy. Concerns over potential changes at the Fed, combined with ongoing trade uncertainty, have negatively impacted investor confidence and led to declines in U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar. Analysts warn that any reduction in the Fed's independence could increase inflation risks.</p>

          <p>A significant measles outbreak in western Texas has surpassed 600 cases, predominantly affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers, with a majority of cases in Gaines County. The outbreak has led to at least 64 hospitalizations, prompting concerns from public health officials, and several other states, including Montana, Louisiana, Missouri, and Virginia, have also reported measles cases. The CDC has confirmed 800 measles cases across at least 24 states, with approximately 97% occurring in unvaccinated individuals. Public health officials emphasize the importance of vaccination, as measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 due to effective vaccination programs.</p>

          <p>Following an attack on prison guards by Hashem Abedi, brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, the UK government will trial the use of tasers in prisons. The incident, in which three guards required hospital treatment, has prompted calls from the Prison Officers' Association for immediate rollout of tasers to protect staff. The trial aims to assess the effectiveness of tasers in managing dangerous prisoners, though some argue a trial is unnecessary given the proven effectiveness of the equipment by police forces. A separate independent review will investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack and assess the operation of separation centers for extremist prisoners.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court seems likely to rule in favor of parents seeking the right to opt their children out of school instruction involving storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether a Maryland school board's policy violates parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. The conservative majority of the court expressed skepticism about the school board's refusal to allow opt-outs, questioning the feasibility and rationale behind the decision. The case involves books with LGBTQ themes incorporated into the elementary school curriculum, sparking debate over parental rights and inclusivity in education.</p>

Applying for a private student loan involves a credit check, which can temporarily affect your credit score, but responsible management of loan payments can build credit over time.

The change could have huge implications for drugmakers, patients and Medicare's spending on prescription drugs.

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that approximately half of Americans hold a negative view of both Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. Concerns about Musk's political activities and potential alienation of prospective buyers have contributed to this sentiment. The survey highlights a polarization, with Democrats and independents having largely negative views of Musk, while Republicans hold a more positive outlook. The survey also reveals that many potential EV customers have a more favorable view of electric vehicles in general than they do of Tesla.</p>

          <p>Stocks rebounded strongly on Tuesday, recovering from a major sell-off triggered by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose significantly, as investors appeared to shrug off concerns about potential changes at the Fed and uncertainty about trade policy. Analysts suggested that factors such as the potential for a US-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Congressional Republicans may have contributed to the rebound. However, the International Monetary Fund warned that the escalating trade war and policy uncertainty would slow U.S. economic growth.</p>
