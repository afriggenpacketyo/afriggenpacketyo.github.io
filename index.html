The proposal also includes a $100 monthly premium for adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal starting in 2027, with the changes projected to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>

Conservative organizations are rallying behind a report claiming higher complication rates from mifepristone, despite criticism from medical experts who cite over 100 scientific studies affirming its safety and effectiveness.

          <p>House Republicans are facing internal divisions over key components of a legislative package encompassing President Trump's agenda, particularly regarding Medicaid changes and state and local tax deductions. Hardliners are criticizing the Medicaid plan as insufficient, while Republicans from states with high state and local taxes are objecting to the proposed deduction cap. Speaker Mike Johnson faces the challenge of uniting his divided conference to pass the bill, with potential defections threatening its advancement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to deport Kseniia Petrova, a Harvard scientist, back to Russia, despite her fears of arrest due to her history of political protest. Petrova faces criminal smuggling charges for failing to declare scientific samples she was carrying in her luggage, a move that has drawn criticism from scientists and academics worldwide. A government lawyer told a federal judge of the intent to deport Ms. Petrova back to Russia, but her lawyer argued this would ordinarily be treated as a minor infraction.</p>
