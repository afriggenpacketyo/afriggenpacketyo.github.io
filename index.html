          <p>The Kooks and Hard-Fi, prominent bands from the 2000s indie rock scene, are experiencing a revival, connecting with new audiences through platforms like TikTok. Both bands, who sold millions of records during their initial run, are back with new music and tour dates. They attribute their resurgence to a cyclical trend where younger listeners rediscover their parents' music and to the anthemic quality of their songs, which had been missing from guitar music for some time. The article also touches on the challenges faced by emerging artists today, including the shrinking live music scene and the impact of streaming on music consumption.</p>

          <p>A January 2025 order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed military service academies to remove readings focused on race, gender, or darker moments in American history, leading to canceled classes and resignations at West Point. Some professors were instructed to avoid mentioning atrocities against Native Americans, while works by Black authors like Toni Morrison were removed. This order has sparked debate over academic freedom versus adherence to Defense Department directives, with some faculty members resigning in protest. The situation has created a challenging environment for West Point's leaders and instructors, forcing them to balance academic integrity with political pressures and military obligations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to appoint Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing Ed Martin's nomination due to lack of Senate support. Pirro, a former Republican district attorney, has been a staunch defender of Trump and previously made false statements about the 2020 election. Her appointment provides Trump with a trusted ally in a crucial Justice Department office, although it raises concerns about potential political influence over legal matters given her close ties to the former president.</p>

Professor Mahesh Anand and his team will analyze the dust to understand the Moon's formation and early Earth history. The research will involve grinding and using lasers on the dust to potentially confirm the theory that the Moon was formed from debris after Earth collided with a Mars-sized planet billions of years ago. The samples are being kept in a high-security facility to prevent contamination, and the team will use specialized equipment to extract valuable data.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning significant cuts to services in an attempt to balance its budget, according to health bosses. These cuts could affect services such as diabetes care, rehab centers, and mental health therapies.

Despite increased government funding, the NHS is facing a substantial overspend, leading to concerns about the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has decided to withhold bonus payments from many of its laid-off employees, despite the bonuses being tied to their high performance from the previous year. The payout of these bonuses has been scheduled after the official separation date for the laid-off workers, effectively preventing them from receiving the money. This decision has sparked criticism and frustration among employees, who view it as unfair given their hard work and contributions.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden stated that he takes some responsibility for President Trump's election victory last year, while also defending his record in office. Biden blamed Trump for undermining a bipartisan border security bill and conceded that he should have better promoted his accomplishments. He also suggested that sexism played a role in Kamala Harris's loss and that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact. Biden also pushed back on claims of cognitive decline, arguing that he accomplished a great deal during his final months in office.</p>

This decision follows the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination due to Republican opposition in the Senate.

          <p>Chris Mason analyzes the recent trade deals secured by the UK, including one with the US, and an expected agreement with the EU. The US deal involves reducing import taxes on British cars and allowing tariff-free entry for some steel and aluminum. While the deal mitigates some of the recent tariff increases, it is not a deep and broad free trade agreement. The analysis suggests that the deal is a limited but positive step for the UK, providing relief for key industries and potentially improving trading conditions.</p>
