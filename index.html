          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 08:03:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, including retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change, effective for new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25, aims to alleviate financial burden on affected beneficiaries. Experts note that while this is an improvement, losing half of one's income can still be devastating, potentially leading to homelessness for those relying on benefits to pay for basic needs. The agency had previously increased the rate to 100% after dropping it to 10%, causing considerable fluctuation and uncertainty for beneficiaries. (not investment advice)</p>

Others, like critic Dean Kissick, believe that the art world has prioritized identity politics over originality and skill.

China and India, key trading partners for Russia, could be targeted, but major Russian banks have already established systems to reduce their visibility to Western regulators.

          <p>President Donald Trump, in an interview with NBC News, took credit for the "good parts" of the economy while attributing the "bad parts" to former President Joe Biden. He defended his tariffs, asserting they will enrich the country, and shifted blame to Biden for the U.S. economy's first-quarter contraction. This strategy of crediting himself for positive developments and blaming his predecessor for negative ones aligns with Trump's approach to economic messaging.</p>

          <p>Samantha Montano, an expert in emergency management, warns that the Trump administration's cuts to disaster management will result in increased American deaths. She argues that the cuts will hollow out agencies like FEMA and NOAA, impairing their ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to disasters. Montano also highlights the potential impact on messaging and communication, essential elements of emergency management, amid the spread of misinformation. The administration has lit the world's premier emergency-management agency on fire, according to Montano.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates amid growing concerns over the impact of Trump's trade war on UK jobs and growth. The move comes as financial markets anticipate an almost certain quarter-point reduction in the key base rate. Economists warn that Trump's trade battles will lead to a significant slowdown in trade, potentially pushing up prices for US consumers and increasing the risk of a recession. The Bank of England is responding to the unfolding economic shock as financial markets expect the US Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war, intended to bring back manufacturing jobs, is having the opposite effect in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. Mack Trucks announced layoffs at its Lehigh Valley plant, citing tariffs and the resulting economic uncertainty. While some workers support Trump's vision, others express concern over the lack of a clear plan. Economists generally agree that manufacturing will not return to its former prominence, making it difficult for communities built around manufacturing to recover.</p>

Ari Ne'eman, a disability advocate and researcher, points to the successful fight against Reagan-era cuts as a model, emphasizing both grassroots mobilization and reframing disability rights in terms that appeal across the political spectrum. He notes the importance of maintaining a service system that is adequately financed and responsive to people's desires about how they want to live. He says that the word disability is as much a coalition as the term people of color or LGBTQ.</p>
