        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, has announced that energy bills will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year. This translates to an annual saving of £129 for a typical household using gas and electricity. While charities welcome this reduction, they emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs, collectively owing suppliers about £4 billion. The price cap, which is updated every three months, sets the maximum suppliers can charge per unit, impacting 21 million households, though prices remain significantly higher than earlier in the decade.</p>

Satellite imagery shows the vessel on its side next to the dock, covered in blue tarpaulins. According to North Korean state media, the incident was caused by "inexperienced command and operational carelessness," leading to the ship capsizing. Kim Jong Un has demanded the frigate be restored before next month's Party Central Committee meeting, an ambitious timeline given the extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote Line resumed Friday morning after being suspended for checks due to problems with pantographs, the apparatus connecting carriages to overhead power lines. Both the inner and outer loops were suspended, causing widespread disruption to commuters. A total of 141 trains on the Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku Lines were canceled, affecting around 197,000 people. The Yamanote Line operated with reduced services after the resumption.

Many teams, including rowing, hockey, squash, soccer, and golf, have a significant number of international players. The Department of Homeland Security cited an unsafe campus environment due to "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" assaulting Jewish students as the reason for the action. Harvard has called the move unlawful and is working to provide guidance to affected students.</p>
