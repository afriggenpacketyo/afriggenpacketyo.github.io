          <p>Israeli ministers have announced the approval of 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, marking the largest expansion in decades. This move includes the retrospective legalization of settler outposts, a decision condemned by Palestinians as a dangerous escalation and an attempt to prevent the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The Israeli government defends the expansion as a strategic measure to prevent a Palestinian state and bolster security, while critics argue it undermines the two-state solution and entrenches the occupation. The UN's top court has previously stated that Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful and that all settlers should be evacuated.

          <p>House Republicans are defending Medicaid reforms in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, asserting it eliminates waste and abuse to benefit Americans needing coverage. Democrats are criticizing potential Medicaid cuts, predicting political repercussions in the 2026 midterms. Republicans argue the bill strengthens Medicaid by removing ineligible recipients and implementing modest work requirements for able-bodied adults, while Democrats claim it will strip millions of healthcare coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that millions will lose health insurance by 2034 due to the bill, a figure Republicans dispute.
