The children have since been discharged from the hospital.

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine, a move that would deepen their split with Israel and the United States. This planned recognition, which could happen as early as September, reflects mounting global pressure over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. While largely symbolic, the action by key Western powers is seen as a major step toward isolating Israel and reviving the two-state solution framework.</p>

          <p>Decades of reliance on declining oil revenue have plunged Alaska into a budget crisis, leaving the state unable to fund nearly $800 million in critical repairs for its deteriorating schools, particularly in remote, rural communities. Despite lawmakers acknowledging the health and safety risks students face, the legislature failed to pass significant funding, and the governor vetoed most of the small amount that was approved. This failure highlights a long-standing inability to agree on a sustainable fiscal solution beyond oil profits.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club. Her family found the remark objectifying and said it raises questions about what the president knew at the time, calling for more answers. The statement comes as Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was recently interviewed by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A new law banning the possession, sale, and manufacture of ninja swords has come into effect across the UK. The legislation is named "Ronan's Law" in memory of Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old who was fatally stabbed with such a weapon in a case of mistaken identity in 2022. His mother, Pooja Kanda, led a relentless campaign for the ban, stating that the weapons were far too easy to acquire online and that the new law will save lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, the Rhisotope Project, is injecting rhino horns with safe, low levels of radioactive material. The isotopes are harmless to the animals but are easily detectable by radiation scanners used at borders and airports. This innovative method aims to deter poachers and traffickers by making the horns a high-risk commodity to smuggle, thereby helping to protect the country's dwindling rhino population from the illegal horn trade.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a widespread black market of illegal and dangerously overcrowded rental properties, known as houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), in London. Undercover reporting and tenant testimony revealed unsanitary conditions, including rats, mould, and dozens of people crammed into small homes. The problem appears to be growing, with evidence suggesting unlicensed HMOs may far outnumber legal ones in some areas, overwhelming the capacity of local councils to enforce safety regulations.</p>
