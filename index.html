          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following intense backlash over the host's on-air comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after major affiliate Nexstar Media Group preemptively dropped the show and the FCC chairman suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk. Kimmel had controversially linked the accused shooter to President Trump's MAGA movement, sparking a political firestorm that has led to a broader debate about free speech and media responsibility. The suspension has drawn both praise from conservative figures and condemnation from those concerned about censorship.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut. Other markets across the Asia-Pacific region showed a mixed reaction, with South Korea's Kospi rising while Australia's ASX 200 declined. The Fed's decision, described as a "risk management cut" by Chairman Jerome Powell, also signaled the possibility of two additional cuts by year-end. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has commenced its policy meeting, where it is expected to maintain its current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The device features a small digital screen that users can control with hand gestures via a neural technology-powered wristband, allowing for tasks like watching videos and responding to messages. This product serves as a bridge between Meta's existing audio-only glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. The company also announced new smart glasses models in partnership with Oakley, designed for athletes, and an updated version of its original audio glasses.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell significantly after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and a disappointing forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Julie Masino addressed the recent controversy surrounding a failed rebrand, acknowledging the intense customer backlash that led the company to scrap its new, modern logo and revert to its traditional branding. The company has suspended its restaurant remodeling plans and is now focused on innovating its menu and enhancing the guest experience. The failed rebrand and subsequent reversal created significant market value fluctuations for the restaurant chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Central Council of Jews in Germany has publicly called on the German government to maintain its "unconditional" support for Israel amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza. During an event marking the council's 75th anniversary, its president, Josef Schuster, made the appeal directly to Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Merz responded by stating that while criticism of the Israeli government must be possible, it should never serve as a pretext for antisemitism. He reaffirmed Germany's commitment to protecting Jewish life and culture within the country as essential to its future.</p>

This finding is the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gases from sources like vehicles and power plants, and its repeal is being strongly opposed by scientists and some members of Congress.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume naturally fermented fruit containing low levels of alcohol. Researchers calculated that the average daily intake of ethanol for a chimp is equivalent to nearly two alcoholic beverages for a human. This finding provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits eaten by wild chimps, lending strong support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis. This theory suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's office has publicly refuted a social media post by President Donald Trump which claimed that California was in the final stages of approving low-income housing in the affluent Pacific Palisades area. A spokesperson for the governor called the assertion a "straight up lie," pointing to an emergency order from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass that explicitly bans applications for such developments in the area's recent fire burn scars. The exchange highlights the ongoing political friction between the state's Democratic leadership and the Republican president over housing and development policies.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates Amid Political Pressure from President Trump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut in response to a weakening labor market, but the modest move is unlikely to satisfy President Trump's demands for more aggressive action. The decision comes as the Trump administration continues its pressure campaign on the central bank's independence, including an attempt to fire a Fed governor and the unusual appointment of a White House economic adviser to the board. This political interference has created a tense environment, testing the Fed's commitment to making decisions based on long-term economic health rather than short-term political whims.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to keep interest rates at 4% during their upcoming meeting, holding steady after a rate cut in August. This decision would contrast with the recent move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower its rates. The primary factor for the Bank of England is that the UK's inflation rate remains at 3.8%, nearly double its 2% target, making another immediate cut risky. Analysts believe that while inflation is expected to fall soon, further rate cuts in the UK are unlikely for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer noted the Fed is in a difficult position, balancing a slowing job market against persistent inflation. He concluded that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's cautious, "steady as she goes" approach was exactly what the market needed for stability. (not investment advice)</p>
