          <p>Karen Kneller, the chief executive of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), has resigned following intense criticism over the organization's handling of wrongful conviction cases. Her departure comes after the CCRC admitted to failing Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, despite significant evidence flaws. This resignation is part of a broader leadership change aimed at restoring confidence in the vital body, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is set to vote on President Trump's extensive tax and immigration bill after it narrowly passed the Senate with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. The legislation includes approximately $4 trillion in tax cuts, new border security funding, and cuts to health programs like Medicaid, which the CBO estimates could leave nearly 12 million people uninsured. With a slim Republican majority, House Speaker Mike Johnson faces potential opposition from fiscal conservatives concerned about the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit.

          <p>A report has revealed that the fire at an electrical substation that caused a major shutdown at Heathrow Airport was due to a fault that National Grid had been aware of since 2018. The investigation found that elevated moisture levels, indicating an imminent fault, were detected years ago, but necessary maintenance was repeatedly deferred. The resulting power outage led to thousands of cancelled flights and cost airlines an estimated Â£80-Â£100 million, prompting energy watchdog Ofgem to launch an investigation into National Grid's failure to maintain its infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Oakland Athletics' planned $1.75 billion stadium in Las Vegas is facing significant skepticism regarding its financial viability and logistical execution. Despite a ceremonial groundbreaking, team owner John Fisher has not secured the full funding for the project, which has already seen cost estimates rise and could reach $2 billion. Critics point to the small nine-acre site, rising construction costs, and a substantial funding gap as major obstacles, questioning whether the controversial move from Oakland to the smaller Las Vegas market will ever result in a completed ballpark.</p>

Experts note that even for the world's wealthiest person, creating a viable third party is a multi-year project that would be nearly impossible to establish in time for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major domestic policy bill includes approximately $1 trillion in cuts to federal health spending, primarily targeting Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Key provisions include a new work requirement for some Medicaid recipients and the elimination of pandemic-era ACA subsidies, which could cause nearly 12 million people to lose insurance coverage, according to the CBO. These changes would reverse recent gains in health coverage and could financially strain hospitals and clinics, especially in rural areas that rely heavily on Medicaid payments.

          <h2>The History of Barbecue Traced from Indigenous Caribbean Roots to American Tradition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The quintessential American tradition of barbecue has its origins with the Indigenous TaÃ­no people of the Caribbean. The term itself derives from the TaÃ­no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames they used for slow-cooking meat over a fire. Spanish explorers later adapted the word to "barbacoa" and spread the cooking method, which has since evolved into diverse regional styles across the United States. This rich history connects the modern July Fourth cookout to a culinary practice that predates European arrival in the Americas.</p>

          <p>The latest version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill, passed by the Senate, proposes to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to bolster the domestic chip supply chain and incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to expand their American operations. The move builds on the 2022 CHIPS Act but reflects the administration's preference for using tariffs and tax incentives to onshore production, potentially accelerating the trend of chipmakers increasing their U.S. investments.
