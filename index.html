          <p>The leaders of France, Germany, Britain, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv to demonstrate their support for Ukraine and to urge Russia to agree to a 30-day cease-fire. This marks the first time that leaders from these four European nations have traveled together to Ukrainian soil, and it is also the first visit for the new German chancellor. The visit follows President Trump's call for a 30-day cease-fire, which Ukraine has agreed to, but Russia has resisted, preferring to negotiate settlement terms first. The leaders aim to create a "coalition of the willing" to help secure Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, focusing on air, land, maritime, and regeneration forces to strengthen Ukraine's armed forces.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has raised millions for a new AI-driven biotech startup named Haemanthus, which aims to develop a product for medical testing. Holmes, currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for fraud related to Theranos, has been advising Evans on the startup. Haemanthus is in its early stages and is focusing on Raman spectroscopy, a technology that can help diagnose diseases like ALS and cancer, with the goal of making it commercially available to patients by using light detection technology and AI sensors. The company hopes to lower the technology's cost and expand its accessibility, with potential applications in testing biological materials such as sweat, urine, saliva, and blood.</p>

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google after the tech giant changed the label for the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following a U.S. presidential order to rename the body of water. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed because Google's change affects the continental shelf of Mexico and Cuba, despite the U.S. order only applying within U.S. territory. Google Maps now displays the Gulf as 'Gulf of America' within the U.S., 'Gulf of Mexico' within Mexico, and both names elsewhere, citing its policy of following local official names where they vary between countries. The lawsuit follows the House's passage of the Gulf of America Act, which seeks to codify the name change.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run home run in the ninth inning, capping off a wild comeback for the Dodgers in a high-scoring game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Dodgers had initially built a five-run lead, which they squandered before rallying in the ninth inning with doubles from Andy Pages and Kiké Hernández, and a single from Max Muncy to tie the game. The Diamondbacks' decision to pitch to Ohtani with a runner on proved costly, as he launched the game-winning home run. The game featured multiple lead changes and highlighted both teams' offensive capabilities in a hitter-friendly environment.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The proposed plans will require employers to invest in UK skills before hiring workers from overseas, targeting sectors like IT and telecommunications. Visa applications from countries with high overstay rates, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, may face stricter screening. Additionally, migrants may need to wait longer before applying for permanent residency, and English language requirements could be tightened, with new rules already in effect for recruiting international care workers.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors released sworn statements and other records detailing key moments in a corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, months after securing a five-count corruption indictment. The documents, released in response to requests, include search warrants and affidavits focusing on Adams's fundraising and ties to Turkey. Federal agents considered seizing Adams's electronic devices at the New York City Marathon but instead approached him later, and the documents suggest Adams may have obstructed efforts to obtain his personal cellphone. The case was ultimately dismissed by a judge following intervention from the Trump administration, leading to accusations of a quid pro quo involving immigration policy concessions.</p>

          <p>Former New Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, has praised the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for expanding trade opportunities between the two nations.

While discussions about the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) continue, Mandelson clarified that abolishing the DST was not part of the agreement.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese officials in Geneva to discuss de-escalating trade tensions. The talks come after President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with 125% levies. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, there is hope that both countries will agree to scale back tariffs, which could relieve financial markets and businesses dependent on U.S.-China trade. Trump has suggested the U.S. could lower its tariffs to 80%, and the meetings are the first between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have developed a close bond built on mutual respect and a shared commitment to defending Ukraine's sovereignty. The two leaders communicate frequently, often bypassing formal diplomatic channels to discuss strategies and offer support. Macron views Zelensky as a courageous leader embodying Ukrainian resistance, while Zelensky sees Macron as a reliable advocate for Ukraine's interests. This relationship has strengthened over time, particularly following Macron's visit to Kyiv and his increased focus on supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is facing scrutiny over proposed job cuts as part of the Trump administration's initiative to reduce the agency's workforce by 15%. While VA Secretary Doug Collins insists that frontline health care will not be affected, data reveals that thousands of VA employees, including nurses and medical support staff, have applied for deferred resignation. Concerns are mounting among veterans and VA staff that these cuts will exacerbate existing shortages of medical providers and negatively impact the quality of care and benefits available to veterans.</p>
