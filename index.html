          <p>The UK Labour party's recent multibillion-pound tech deal with the US, aimed at boosting economic growth by welcoming energy-intensive AI data centers, is drawing criticism for its potential negative consequences. Experts warn that the rapid expansion of generative AI will dramatically increase electricity and water consumption, conflicting with the UK's net-zero emissions goals. Beyond the environmental strain, concerns are mounting over the social costs, including the erosion of students' cognitive skills and the potential for AI chatbots to contribute to mental health crises. The article argues for a more cautious approach that balances the technology's benefits with its significant, and often undiscussed, trade-offs.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a provider of check-in and boarding systems, has caused widespread disruption at major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. The attack on the company's MUSE software forced airlines to revert to manual check-in processes, leading to long queues, flight delays, and cancellations that continued for a second day. Parent company RTX confirmed the "cyber-related disruption" was limited to check-in and baggage drop systems. This incident highlights the vulnerability of the aviation industry's interconnected digital infrastructure, where compromising a single third-party vendor can have far-reaching, cross-border consequences for travelers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his nomination of senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to be the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. This move places a presidential legal ally in charge of an office that has been investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. The nomination follows the resignation of the previous U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, who reportedly stepped down amid pressure from the administration to bring charges against James, a frequent political opponent of Trump. The appointment is seen as part of a broader push by the administration for retribution against political adversaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an era dominated by streaming and declining box office revenue for major blockbusters, Los Angeles's independent repertory cinemas are experiencing a resurgence. Theaters like Vidiots' Eagle Theater and the New Beverly are attracting dedicated audiences by offering unique, curated experiences, such as screenings of rare 35-millimeter prints and special events with filmmakers. This model has proven resilient, fostering a sense of community and appealing to a younger, more diverse audience seeking an alternative to mainstream multiplexes. While reliant on nonprofit models and donations, these revival houses are revitalizing LA's film culture by celebrating cinema as a shared, communal art form.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite intense partisan battles over redistricting in states like Texas and California, historical trends and current political dynamics suggest control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections will likely be determined by broader factors. While Democrats need to flip only a few seats, the party holding the presidency typically loses seats in midterms. Key indicators such as President Trump's approval rating, economic conditions, and voter enthusiasm will likely have a greater impact than gerrymandering efforts. Political analysts note that while redistricting could shift a number of seats, the ultimate outcome will probably rest with the electorate's overall mood and satisfaction with the party in power.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that wildfire smoke is a more significant public health threat than previously understood, potentially causing between 68,000 and 71,000 excess deaths annually across North America by 2050. The study, published in Nature, attributes over 41,000 deaths per year to smoke from 2011 to 2020, with climate change expected to worsen the impact by creating hotter, drier conditions. California is projected to see the largest increase in smoke-related mortality due to its fire-prone environment and large population. The findings highlight the urgent need for adaptive measures like improved indoor air filtration and expanded use of prescribed burns to mitigate the growing health risks.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece posits that the rise of artificial intelligence is accelerating a decline in human cognitive abilities, a trend that began with the internet's prevalence. Citing recent studies from institutions like MIT, the author argues that reliance on large-language models such as ChatGPT leads to "cognitive offloading," which weakens the brain's capacity for critical and deep thinking. The research reportedly shows that frequent AI users exhibit weaker brain connectivity and consistently underperform on cognitive tasks. The author expresses concern that this widespread adoption of AI, particularly among younger generations, is creating a dependency that diminishes independent problem-solving skills and fosters intellectual atrophy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is poised to officially recognize a Palestinian state, a move that places it at odds with its close ally, the United States. The decision follows a deadline set by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had conditioned the recognition on Israel taking steps toward a ceasefire in Gaza and facilitating humanitarian aid. While largely symbolic, the UK's action is intended to increase diplomatic pressure to end the conflict and preserve the viability of a two-state solution. This development comes as other Western nations, including France and Canada, are also preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood ahead of the UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>There is a growing sense of optimism regarding Europe's economic future, particularly in Germany and the UK. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have turned more positive on Germany's economic outlook, citing an opportunity for the government to build on an improved macroeconomic picture. In London, the Canary Wharf financial district is experiencing a revival, with major banks returning and office leasing expected to hit a decade high, signaling a strong return-to-office trend. This positive sentiment is also echoed in the private markets sector, where investors are looking to Europe to hedge against policy uncertainty in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans football team improved their record to 4-0 with a 45-31 win against Michigan State, though the victory was marred by defensive penalties. The offense, led by receiver Makai Lemon who had 127 receiving yards, moved the ball effectively, accumulating 517 total yards. However, USC's defense struggled with discipline, committing 10 penalties that allowed Michigan State to stay in the game until the fourth quarter. A crucial late-game drive, capped by a touchdown from Lemon, ultimately secured the win for the Trojans as they head into a more challenging stretch of their schedule against ranked opponents.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested by the FBI on a federal charge after allegedly firing at least three shots into the lobby of the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, was initially arrested by local police for the drive-by shooting and released on bail before being taken back into federal custody. No injuries were reported in the incident, which is being investigated for a motive. The shooting at the ABC affiliate comes during a week of heightened controversy for the network, which suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's comments on the Charlie Kirk assassination.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has issued new rules requiring journalists to have all information, even if unclassified, approved by an official before reporting it, a policy that critics are calling a form of prior restraint. Reporters must sign an agreement to abide by these new regulations or risk having their press credentials revoked and being barred from the building. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the move, stating the press does not run the secure facility. Press freedom organizations have condemned the policy as a direct assault on independent journalism and government transparency, arguing it will severely limit the ability to hold the military accountable.</p>

          <p>Amid China's property crisis, stalled and unfinished real estate developments are being repurposed as lavish film sets for the country's rapidly growing micro-drama industry. The on-screen opulence of these short-form dramas, which often feature romance stories set in luxurious homes and offices, contrasts sharply with the reality of the idle construction sites. This trend provides a new, albeit temporary, use for these properties as the micro-drama market has exploded in popularity, with viewership surpassing 660 million people in 2024. The demand for high-end locations has created an unusual synergy between the struggling property sector and the booming entertainment niche.</p>

His assassination has intensified a national conversation about his controversial legacy and the heated political climate.

The film's popularity highlights the enduring sensitivity of historical issues in the region.

Zhang was initially imprisoned in 2020 for her firsthand video accounts from the pandemic's epicenter, which contradicted the official state narrative.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League title contenders Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly incorporating a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactic traditionally associated with less dominant teams. This shift is seen as a response to the prevalence of sophisticated high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back riskier. By utilizing the long-passing abilities of goalkeepers like David Raya and targeting tall, physical forwards such as Kai Havertz and Erling Haaland, both teams can bypass the press, gain territory, and create isolated attacking duels. This tactical evolution adds unpredictability and demonstrates how top managers adapt to negate opponents' strengths.</p>

          <p>As several Western nations prepare to recognize a Palestinian state, analysts are debating the practical impact of such a move. While largely symbolic, recognition could strengthen the Palestinian position in future negotiations by elevating their diplomatic status to that of a state-to-state peer with Israel. Supporters argue it reaffirms Palestinian rights to self-determination, while critics, including Israel and the U.S., condemn it as a "reward for terror." However, many experts agree that for recognition to be effective, it must be accompanied by concrete actions, such as sanctions or other punitive measures, to pressure Israel to end its occupation and military actions.</p>

However, this diplomatic support is met with the harsh reality of increasing Israeli military control and settlement expansion. The mayor of Jenin stated that while recognition is crucial for the future, he anticipates it will provoke Israel into annexing more West Bank land in retaliation. Residents describe a feeling of powerlessness as Israeli forces and settlers exert control, making the international gesture a bittersweet development amid ongoing conflict and occupation.</p>
