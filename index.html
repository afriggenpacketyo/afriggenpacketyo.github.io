          <p>Nottingham Forest has fired head coach Ange Postecoglou following a 3-0 loss to Chelsea, making his 39-day tenure the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. The club, which is now seeking its third manager this season, confirmed the decision after a string of poor results left them in the relegation zone. Postecoglou failed to secure a single win in his eight matches. Former Everton boss Sean Dyche and ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini are reportedly being considered as potential replacements for the position.</p>

          <p>A social media trend known as the "Great Lock-In" is encouraging people to use the autumn season to establish healthier routines and reset before the holidays. Experts advise starting with small, achievable goals, such as short morning walks or adding more produce to meals, to build momentum and confidence. The focus is on consistent progress rather than perfection, helping to avoid burnout by pacing oneself and integrating new habits into daily life. This approach aims to create sustainable lifestyle changes that extend beyond a single season, fostering long-term well-being.</p>

          <p>A coalition of activist groups, including the ACLU and Indivisible, has organized a second wave of "No Kings" protests across the United States to challenge what they describe as abuses of power by the Trump administration. The rallies focus on issues such as immigration policies and the deployment of troops in American cities. In response, some Republican leaders have labeled the events as "hate America" rallies and suggested they are prolonging the government shutdown. Organizers, however, maintain that the protests are a fundamental exercise of American rights against perceived authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The musician D'Angelo, born Michael Eugene Archer, has passed away at age 51 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, leaving behind a profound legacy in Black music. Often compared to legends like Prince and Smokey Robinson, he was a pivotal figure in the "neo-soul" movement with albums like 'Brown Sugar' and 'Voodoo.' His work frequently explored the intersections of the sacred and secular, drawing from his Pentecostal upbringing. His final album, 'Black Messiah,' released in 2014, was a powerful commentary on modern racial strife, solidifying his status as a unique and influential artist.</p>

          <p>A new study from Macromedia University of Applied Sciences indicates a significant bias in German media, where foreign crime suspects are mentioned about three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. Journalism professor Thomas Hestermann, who led the research, noted that this distortion has grown drastically since 2015 and influences public perception of danger. The study found this pattern consistent across various media outlets, regardless of their political leaning. Criminologists suggest this "migrantization" of crime incorrectly links criminal behavior to origin rather than socioeconomic risk factors like poverty.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more inclined than women to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or marriage. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial savings was a key motivator for men. Experts suggest that beyond economics, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when single. This dependency may drive their eagerness to commit, challenging the long-held belief that women are the ones who push for commitment.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, following continued scrutiny over his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The decision was made in consultation with King Charles III to prevent the accusations from distracting from the Royal Family's work. This move comes as excerpts from a posthumous memoir by accuser Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was sexually trafficked to the prince, have been released. Andrew, who settled a civil lawsuit with Giuffre in 2022, continues to deny all allegations against him.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 1,500-year history, the Grand Sumo Tournament is being held outside of Japan, taking place at London's Royal Albert Hall. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers competing in 100 bouts, requiring significant logistical efforts, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament, deeply rooted in Shinto religious traditions, offers a rare opportunity for a Western audience to experience Japan's national sport. The last time the competition was held abroad was also in London in 1991.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles-based group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth is creating a vital space for Black men to discuss their mental well-being, a topic often stigmatized in their community. Founded by Desmond Carter, the bi-monthly meetings offer a supportive environment where men can be vulnerable without judgment, addressing a critical need as suicide rates among Black men have risen. The initiative aims to counteract the effects of systemic racism, economic pressures, and cultural expectations that discourage emotional expression.

Her trip highlights the growing complexities of U.S.-China relations, which have impacted academic and cultural travel. Due to a state order restricting the use of state funds for travel to China, her university had canceled its programs, forcing her to organize her trip through a non-profit. This situation illustrates how geopolitical tensions are affecting individual students and discouraging once-routine international study opportunities, turning a simple trip into a political act.</p>
