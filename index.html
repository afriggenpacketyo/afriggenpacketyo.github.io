          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has won the 2025 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby, becoming the first catcher and switch-hitter to ever win the competition. He defeated Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero in the final round with a score of 18 to 15. Raleigh, who entered the All-Star break leading the majors with 38 home runs, secured his first-round spot on a narrow tiebreaker. The event, held at Truist Park, also featured a 513-foot home run by Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, the longest of the night.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million people in the U.S. Northeast are under flood watches as severe storms cause dangerous flash flooding and significant transportation disruptions. New York City, Washington D.C., and other major metropolitan areas have been issued flash flood warnings, with rainfall rates reaching up to four inches per hour in some locations. The extreme weather has led to submerged subway stations in Manhattan, blocked expressways, and stranded vehicles.

          <p>China's economy demonstrated stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter, with the gross domestic product expanding by 5.2%, surpassing the government's annual target. This performance, reported by the National Bureau of Statistics, has eased pressure on policymakers to introduce further economic stimulus. However, the growth rate marked a slowdown from the first quarter's 5.4%, and other indicators like retail sales and real estate investment showed signs of weakness. Despite the positive headline figure, economists remain cautious about future headwinds and insufficient domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A joint report from the World Health Organization and UNICEF has revealed that more than 14 million children worldwide were completely unvaccinated in 2024. The report highlights that in Europe and Central Asia, childhood vaccination rates have either stagnated or declined, widening coverage gaps and placing millions at risk of preventable diseases. Officials attribute this concerning trend to the spread of misinformation and significant cuts in international aid. UNICEF chief Catherine Russell expressed deep concern, stating that the lack of protection for millions of children should be a worry for everyone.</p>

The sales of these chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, had been halted in April. This development follows a preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing and increased lobbying efforts by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has argued that such restrictions harm American tech leadership.

According to sources within USAID, the high-energy biscuits, enough to feed 1.5 million children for a week, are set to expire and will be destroyed at a cost of $130,000 to taxpayers. This action follows an executive order that halted most foreign assistance, and repeated requests from federal workers to ship the food before it spoiled were allegedly ignored.

          <p>A group of major UK landowners, including wealthy estates and charities, has initiated a High Court judicial review to challenge the government's recent leasehold reforms. They argue that the 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act, which aims to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, violates their property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The claimants state the changes could result in massive financial losses and impact their ability to invest in communities and charitable activities.

This marks a significant shift in policy, aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities against Russian aggression. Alongside the weapons plan, Trump threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. The move, which follows a meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte, signals a tougher stance on Moscow after Trump expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin's lack of progress toward ending the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Port of Los Angeles Reports Record June Traffic as Shippers Rush to Pre-Empt Tariffs</h2>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its 117-year history, processing a record number of shipping containers as importers raced to get goods into the country ahead of potential new tariffs on Chinese products. Port officials described the 8% year-over-year increase as a "tariff whipsaw effect," rather than a sign of organic economic growth. The surge was fueled by businesses trying to beat an August 12 deadline for trade negotiations with China. Executives anticipate that shipping volume will likely ease significantly in the coming months if new tariffs are implemented, creating more uncertainty for supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas has risen to 131, with 97 people still reported missing in the Kerrville area ten days after the initial disaster. The tragedy, which occurred after a flash flood on the Guadalupe River, has been compounded by warnings of new storms threatening the already devastated region. Governor Greg Abbott confirmed the updated casualty count and announced a special legislative session to investigate the disaster response. The event ranks among the deadliest U.S. floods in decades, raising questions about the lack of warning systems in the area.</p>

The 11-year initiative collects detailed MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound scans of participants' brains, hearts, and other organs to create a massive database for medical research. By combining this imaging data with genetic and lifestyle information from half a million volunteers, scientists aim to identify early markers of diseases like cancer and dementia.

Speaking at a business forum, Peña stated that Paraguay would "stand firmly by Taiwan" and defend the 68-year partnership "with all its strength." The declaration comes amid ongoing pressure from Beijing for countries to switch their recognition from Taipei to mainland China. Paraguay remains one of the few countries, and the only one in South America, that maintains full diplomatic relations with the self-ruled island of Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rebounded on Monday after a sharp decline late last week. The initial drop was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase planned to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information, raising concerns about fintech business models. However, several financial analysts have since downplayed the threat, with firms like Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley describing the potential cost increases as "negligible" for major players. The rally was also supported by broader market momentum, including a record close for the Nasdaq and a rise in cryptocurrency prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lockheed Martin has delivered 72 F-35 fighter jets to the U.S. government as of May 1, following significant delays caused by issues with a critical software and hardware upgrade. The upgrade, known as Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3), is intended to enhance the stealth fighter's processing power and displays. Due to the persistent delays, the Pentagon has been withholding a portion of the payment for each jet, a practice that will continue for new production aircraft. The F-35 program is a crucial revenue source for Lockheed, accounting for approximately 30% of its total income.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's recent policy shift on Ukraine, including authorizing new weapons and threatening tariffs, is driven less by a strategic change and more by personal frustration. According to White House sources, Trump feels personally humiliated by Vladimir Putin's refusal to agree to a peace deal, making him look like a junior partner in their relationship. After months of deferring to the Russian leader and believing he could broker a deal, Trump has grown angry as Putin has ignored his pleas and escalated attacks. This perceived slight reportedly motivated the tougher stance.</p>
