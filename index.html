        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House announced that Canada has reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax that would have affected major U.S. technology firms. A spokesperson stated that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump after he threatened to raise tariffs and halt trade negotiations. The proposed 3% tax on Canadian revenue for companies like Google and Meta was intended to ensure large tech companies paid taxes on earnings from Canadians. The reversal is being framed by the White House as a significant win for American companies and workers.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparations in California. The troops were originally deployed by the Trump administration to handle protests, a move contested by the state's governor. With an active wildfire season expected, state officials have expressed concern that the deployment has left firefighting forces understaffed. This potential shift would move 200 of the 4,000 deployed Guard members to help address the state's environmental crisis.</p>

          <p>Travelers on the U.S. East Coast faced a nightmare scenario as severe thunderstorms caused extensive flight disruptions ahead of a holiday weekend. Major airports including JFK, Newark, and LaGuardia in New York, as well as hubs in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., experienced significant ground delays, with some lasting up to four hours. Cumulatively, the disruptions led to approximately 600 flight cancellations and 1,900 delays across the five airports.

          <p>A federal judge has postponed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers requested the delay, citing conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be immediately deported again upon release from federal custody. Abrego Garcia's case has become a focal point in the debate over U.S. immigration policy, as his initial removal was an error due to his protected legal status. He will now remain in custody until at least mid-July while the courts address these legal conflicts.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of the Republican-backed tax and domestic policy package, suggesting he will support primary challenges against GOP members who vote for it. Musk condemned the bill as the "biggest debt increase in history" and vowed that lawmakers who supported it would "lose their primary next year." His opposition centers on the bill's spending levels and its cuts to green energy tax credits, which he called "utter madness." This stance puts him at odds with former President Trump, who has heavily pressured Republicans to pass the legislation.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers showed surprising growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, diverging from official government data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. This growth is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. The Caixin survey focuses on smaller, export-driven firms, providing a different perspective on the health of the Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities say the suspect, identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, deliberately started a wildfire to draw first responders to the scene before opening fire on them with a shotgun. Roley was later found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. In a tragic irony, investigators revealed that the suspect had previously expressed a desire to become a firefighter himself, though the exact motive for the attack remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party is experiencing significant internal conflict over proposed changes to the welfare system, despite holding a large governmental majority. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall's defense of the reforms has failed to reassure many backbench MPs, with some estimating that 40 to 50 members are opposed. The core of the dispute involves tightening eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a key disability benefit. This row exposes deep ideological divisions within the party between those prioritizing fiscal credibility and those defending the social safety net.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It does so by targeting and inhibiting a specific enzyme, revealing a key molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. These findings could lead to new strategies for promoting longevity by simulating the effects of exercise.</p>

          <p>A report from UK child health experts suggests that falling childhood vaccination rates are more often caused by logistical barriers than by vaccine hesitancy. Parents face obstacles such as difficulty booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear information or reminders about which vaccines their children need. This has led to no childhood vaccine meeting the 95% uptake target, resulting in the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. Experts are calling for better support and easier access to vaccination services to address the decline.</p>
