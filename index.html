          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, recently told federal prosecutors she does not believe Epstein died by suicide in federal prison. Transcripts from a Florida jailhouse interview reveal Maxwell's skepticism, where she noted that "life is cheap" in prison and suggested an internal situation if his death was indeed murder, without offering specific culprits. She also criticized the U.S. Bureau of Prisons for mismanagement and dereliction of duty, dismissing the idea that his death was a way to silence him. This article highlights her consistent stance against the official ruling, adding to the ongoing debate surrounding Epstein's demise.</p>

          <p>British tennis star Emma Raducanu has expressed a desire for Wimbledon and other Grand Slams to adopt an innovative mixed doubles event, similar to the one recently trialed at the US Open. Raducanu, who partnered with Carlos Alcaraz in the New York event, believes the format, which included a $1 million prize and a shorter "fast four" style before the main singles tournaments, was a significant success. She argues that such an addition would generate more buzz and engagement for the sport. While other majors traditionally resist change, the success of the US Open event has sparked further discussion about the future of mixed doubles in tennis.</p>

          <p>Ether, a leading cryptocurrency, achieved its first new record since 2021 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate adjustments during his Jackson Hole speech. Powell's comments, suggesting a shift in policy stance due to evolving economic risks, led to significant short liquidations in Ether, pushing its price higher. Crypto trading firms noted a panicked repositioning by traders, anticipating a September rate cut and aligning with an easing stance from the administration and the Fed. This article highlights how regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest in stablecoins, largely powered by Ethereum, have positioned Ether as a major macro trade for the coming years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose new tariffs on imported furniture later this year, following an ongoing investigation into the sector. Trump stated on Truth Social that the tariffs, yet to be determined, aim to revitalize the furniture business in several U.S. states. Following his announcement, shares of major furniture and home goods companies like Wayfair and Williams-Sonoma tumbled, while La-Z-Boy, which primarily manufactures in the U.S., saw its shares rise. This article notes that these potential tariffs come at a challenging time for the U.S. furniture industry, already grappling with decreased demand due to a slower housing market and persistent inflation.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's market value plummeted by nearly $100 million after the release of its new logo, which replaced the long-standing image of an overall-clad man with a cleaner design featuring only the chain's name. The stock experienced a significant drop, reflecting Wall Street's reaction to the rebranding effort aimed at modernizing the 55-year-old company's image. While the company stated its values remain unchanged and the "Uncle Herschel" figure will stay in restaurants, conservative commentators and marketing experts criticized the redesign, some labeling it as "woke." This article highlights the financial and public backlash to the company's strategic overhaul.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), following an intelligence assessment on US strikes against Iranian nuclear sites that reportedly angered President Donald Trump. The DIA's preliminary assessment suggested Iran's program was set back by only a few months, contradicting Trump's assertions of "obliteration." This firing marks the latest in a series of upheavals within US military and intelligence agencies under the Trump administration, which has a history of removing officials whose data or analysis conflict with the president's views. The article underscores concerns about the politicization of intelligence work.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has acquired a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, a significant $8.9 billion investment largely funded through CHIPS Act grants. President Trump hailed the deal as a "great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL," even though the government purchased shares at a discount. This action underscores a distinct shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the administration taking a more active role in the private sector to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. This article details Intel's strategic efforts to enhance its chip production capabilities on U.S. soil, despite facing challenges and construction slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security, but many are unaware that their benefits can shrink due to several factors beyond early claiming. This article outlines three primary ways: the earnings test for those working before full retirement age, automatic deductions for Medicare Part B premiums (especially for high-income earners), and federal income taxes on benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds. Understanding these potential reductions is crucial for retirement planning, as they can significantly impact monthly income. The article also suggests options like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities to supplement income if benefits fall short. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article criticizes President Donald Trump's suggestion that the Smithsonian Institution should not focus on "how bad slavery was," viewing it as part of a broader effort to whitewash American history. The author, Francine Prose, argues that such directives aim to replace historical truth with "unifying and constructive descriptions," thereby undermining efforts to address systemic inequities. This article contends that denying the realities of slavery and other historical injustices is not only an insult to affected communities but also prevents a comprehensive understanding of the present.

          <p>California and Texas, the two most populous U.S. states, are at the heart of a political battle over congressional redistricting that could significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. After Texas's Republican-majority legislature redrew maps to favor Republicans, California lawmakers retaliated by creating new districts designed to boost Democratic representation. This article explains that redistricting, or gerrymandering, is legal unless racially motivated, but this mid-decade, partisan push by states, encouraged by President Trump, is unusual. Critics argue the process allows politicians to choose voters, potentially diluting minority voting power and leading to complex legal challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses a previous stance that troops would not carry weapons during their mission. While the administration praises the deployment, which involves approximately 2,000 troops, polls indicate it is deeply unpopular with city residents. This article notes that it is unclear if arming the troops will alter their current role, which has primarily involved patrolling near landmarks rather than direct law enforcement, and highlights President Trump's consideration of expanding the mission to other cities.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez appeared before California's parole board, seeking his freedom a day after his brother Erik was denied parole, decades after their 1989 conviction for murdering their parents.

The move, while welcomed by the White House as "long overdue," faced criticism from Canada's Conservative leader.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations-backed report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has declared famine in Gaza, specifically attributing the crisis to "entirely man-made" factors, including Israeli restrictions on aid. This article details how Israeli policies, such as a nearly three-month total blockade and a controversial new food distribution system, exacerbated the situation, leading to widespread starvation and mortality. Despite Israel's denials and accusations against aid agencies and Hamas, international bodies and leaders, including the UN Secretary-General, have condemned the obstruction of aid, calling it a moral outrage and a potential war crime. The report highlights the urgent need for increased humanitarian access.</p>
