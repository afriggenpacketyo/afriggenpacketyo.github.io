          <h2>Liam Dawson to Return to England's Test Cricket Team After Eight-Year Hiatus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:31:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson has been selected for England's Test team to face India, marking his first appearance in this format in eight years. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces Shoaib Bashir, who is sidelined with a broken finger. Dawson's inclusion is seen as a move to bolster England's lower-order batting, as his first-class average surpasses that of some top-order players. This unexpected recall comes after a long period away from the Test side, during which England played 102 matches, highlighting a significant return for the experienced Hampshire player.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has announced it will not comply with a data request from French authorities, labeling the criminal investigation into alleged data tampering as politically motivated. The company claims the probe, which focuses on algorithmic manipulation and fraudulent data extraction, is an attempt to restrict free speech. French prosecutors initiated the investigation after receiving complaints about potential foreign interference. X has raised concerns about the impartiality of the experts chosen to analyze its algorithm, suggesting the investigation has a predetermined outcome and distorts French law.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot performed what he described to passengers as an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft during a landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot stated that air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport, did not provide a warning about the converging military plane. He apologized for the sudden turn, explaining it was the safest option given the bomber's speed and proximity. The Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Air Force are both investigating the incident, which involved a flight with 76 passengers and four crew members.</p>

          <p>A Bangladesh Air Force F-7 BGI training jet crashed into a school and college campus in Dhaka, resulting in at least 19 fatalities and injuring 164 others. The military reported that the aircraft experienced a technical failure shortly after takeoff, and the pilot, who was among the deceased, attempted to steer it away from populated areas before the crash. The incident involved a Chinese-made variant of the Soviet MiG-21 and has prompted the formation of an investigative committee. Eyewitnesses described a large fire and chaotic scenes as rescuers worked to help victims, many of whom were students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies a common misconception about IRS tax extensions, emphasizing that they only provide more time to file tax returns, not to pay the taxes owed. The deadline for payment remains April 15, and failing to pay by this date results in penalties and interest, even if a filing extension has been granted. To avoid these charges, taxpayers should estimate their liability and pay as much as possible when requesting the extension. For those unable to pay their full bill, the IRS offers options like installment agreements and an Offer in Compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

He attributed the increase in such "collateral" arrests to a lack of cooperation from sanctuary cities.

The findings are based on data from thousands of participants who donated baby teeth for a survey starting in the 1950s.

A local campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation.

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Eastern European Nations Lag in Women's Football</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:42:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, as seen in Euro 2025, nations in Eastern and parts of Southern Europe have struggled to keep pace. This article explores the reasons for this disparity, citing a lack of investment, inadequate infrastructure, and persistent cultural biases that view football as a "man's game." Experts note that the collapse of state-sponsored sports after the fall of communism and the rise of right-wing politics emphasizing traditional values have also hindered development. However, initiatives from UEFA and increased budgets are beginning to show positive results, offering hope for future growth.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that public service media (PSM) is under a "serious threat" and has called on YouTube to give more prominence to content from broadcasters like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4. The report highlights that children now watch significantly more YouTube than all public service channels combined, risking the future of PSM if this trend continues. Ofcom suggests that the government should consider legislation to ensure the visibility of PSM content, particularly news and children's programming, on major online platforms to help it reach younger audiences and remain relevant.</p>

          <p>Prominent Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi, who was arrested in connection with recent anti-government protests, has had the most serious charges of terrorism against him dropped. Instead, he was charged with the lesser offense of unlawful possession of ammunition, specifically three teargas canisters and a blank round, which he denies. Mwangi was freed on bond after his court appearance, where he told supporters that the government was scared of young people organizing for a better country. His arrest had sparked fears of a crackdown on dissent amid renewed unrest in Kenya.</p>

          <p>The England women's football team's decision to stop taking the knee before matches has drawn questions from anti-discrimination body Fare, especially after defender Jess Carter experienced racist abuse online. The Lionesses stated that the gesture's impact had diminished and a new approach was needed to combat racism. However, Fare's executive director argued that taking the knee remains a powerful anti-racist act and that powerful actions are needed now. The incident has intensified calls for social media platforms to be held accountable under the UK's Online Safety Act for failing to remove harmful content.</p>

It details the wildlife management efforts at Boston's Logan International Airport, where teams use pyrotechnics, air cannons, and habitat modification to deter birds from flight paths. The piece also delves into the history of forensic ornithology, which began after a fatal 1960 crash at Logan, and explains how identifying bird species from remains helps engineers design safer aircraft.

Vets and zookeepers explain that animals with light-colored or sparse fur, like certain dog breeds, white cats, and even pigs, are susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer. The practice is a human solution to problems often created by humans, such as selective breeding for appearance or keeping animals in unnatural environments. While applying sunscreen to a cat can be a challenge, it can prevent serious health issues for vulnerable animals exposed to intense sun.</p>
