          <h2>House Approves $9 Billion in Spending Cuts After Delays Over Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:50:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal spending, primarily targeting foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote, which occurred after midnight, was delayed for hours due to procedural debates initiated by Democrats demanding a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This legislation, strongly supported by President Trump, represents a significant, though largely symbolic, victory for fiscal conservatives aiming to reduce government expenditures. The bill now proceeds to the president's desk for his signature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court for the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This directive follows a Wall Street Journal report about an alleged lewd letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has vehemently denied as fake. The move is seen as a response to growing pressure from his political base, which has been fueled by conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death and a supposed high-profile client list. Bondi has stated her readiness to file the motion promptly.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:17:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a $9 billion spending cut package, Congress has eliminated all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. NPR's CEO described the move as an "irreversible loss" and an "unwarranted dismantling of beloved local civic institutions" that will disproportionately harm rural and underserved communities. Critics of the cuts argued that public broadcasting provides essential services, including emergency alerts in areas with unreliable communications. The decision culminates years of conservative criticism alleging left-wing bias at the public media networks.</p>

          <p>In what is being hailed as a victory for the Trump administration, Congress has passed a $9 billion rescissions package, sending it to the president's desk. The legislation cuts funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which Republicans celebrated as a step toward defunding "woke" initiatives. The process was marked by intense partisan debate, with Democrats attempting to force votes related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, a move Republicans characterized as a political tactic. This marks the first successful use of the rescissions process in over two decades.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, calling it "unacceptable blackmail." The proposed tariffs are reportedly conditioned on the dropping of legal charges against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a move Lula described as a grave attack on his nation's sovereignty. Lula asserted that no foreign leader would dictate terms to Brazil and labeled Brazilian politicians supporting Trump's stance as "traitors to the homeland." The dispute escalates diplomatic tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Alexander Hurst reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood is a continuous process of "winging it" rather than reaching a state of complete self-assuredness. Using the French comedy series 'Bref' as a narrative anchor, he explores themes of evolving relationships, regret, and the immigrant experience of forging a new identity. The author concludes that while he lacks definitive answers, he embraces the journey of life, finding meaning in relationships and the courage to confront difficult questions in a world that feels increasingly chaotic.</p>

The analysis connects the decision to the pending Skydance-Paramount merger, a recent controversial lawsuit settlement with Trump, and the departure of a top '60 Minutes' executive, suggesting a troubling erosion of the network's editorial independence.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, argues the administration's action is "arbitrary and capricious" and motivated by President Trump's "personal animus" toward the project. Governor Gavin Newsom called the move a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that will jeopardize jobs, vowing to fight the decision in court to prevent the project from being derailed.</p>

          <p>A former senior intelligence officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency has described China's alleged experiments to create biologically enhanced "supersoldiers" as a disturbing reality. Nicholas Eftimiades stated that China has been exploring concepts to modify human physiology and behavior for some time, aiming to create a superior individual for combat. While the extent of their accomplishments is unknown, he noted that the most concerning aspect is that the research is being conducted under the authority of the People's Liberation Army.</p>

Both victims were hospitalized with injuries, and police are seeking to arrest the unidentified suspects for substantial battery and disorderly conduct.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the persistent conflict between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed. The president has repeatedly criticized Powell for keeping interest rates high and has reportedly asked lawmakers about the possibility of firing him. The piece explains the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to maintain low unemployment and stable prices, a balancing act that often requires making unpopular decisions independent of political pressure. Any attempt to remove Powell could be legally challenged and risk turmoil in financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a series of immigration raids in Sacramento, with a sector chief recording a video in front of the state capitol to declare, "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state."

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market, reversing a 2022 ban.

The decision was immediately criticized by anti-tobacco groups, who blame Juul for sparking the teen vaping crisis and argue its products should be permanently banned from sale.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's announcement that he secured a deal for Coca-Cola to start using "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup. The piece frames the move as a political gesture to appeal to his base and health-conscious voters like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who praised the change. However, it points out that from a health perspective, the switch is largely meaningless, as scientific analyses show cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup have nearly identical metabolic effects and are both major contributors to obesity and diabetes.</p>
