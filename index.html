          <p>China's advanced PL-15 air-to-air missiles have reportedly been tested in combat during a recent skirmish between Pakistan and India in Kashmir, marking the missile's combat debut after years of speculation. The deployment of the PL-15E by the Pakistan Air Force highlights the growing capabilities of China's air-to-air missile systems and advanced fighter aircraft. This development has implications for regional security in the Asia-Pacific, particularly concerning potential Taiwan contingencies. The missile's performance has been difficult to assess due to conflicting claims from both sides of the Kashmir conflict, however this is the first official report of the missile being tested in real combat.</p>

          <p>Facing numerous lawsuits alleging harm to users' mental health, particularly among children, TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will automatically activate during "sleep hours" for users under 18. This initiative follows public pressure and lawsuits from state attorneys general, accusing TikTok of being intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to young users. The company hopes these features will promote healthier digital habits and address concerns about the platform's impact on its young audience.</p>

Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, driven by strong performance across most regions except Asia Pacific, where sales declined due to a drop in China. This report follows Richemont's "highest ever" quarterly sales in January, initially signaling a potential turnaround in the luxury sector.

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department after four former housekeepers filed a civil suit accusing him of multiple acts of sexual assault dating back to 2014.

Robinson's attorney denies the allegations, claiming the accusers filed their police report after the civil suit to publicize their case.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work could offer insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced major population declines throughout history. Archaeological evidence suggests human migration from northern Asia to South America occurred at least 23,000 years ago.</p>

Johansson's legal team took action, leading OpenAI to remove "Sky."

          <p>Japan's economy contracted more than anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, with a 0.2% decrease attributed to falling exports and stagnant consumption. The decline was exacerbated by U.S. trade policies, including tariffs on Japanese goods, raising concerns about further economic slowdown. The Japanese central bank had been gradually hiking interest rates to boost the economy but now faces increased uncertainty. Experts suggest that the possibility of a recession cannot be ruled out, depending on the impact of ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>A large, dark patch has appeared in the waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, near Barra da Tijuca Beach. Reuters drone footage shows the brownish water contrasting with the ocean's blue. A biologist explained that the patch is linked to urban growth and inadequate sanitation, resulting in sewage flowing into rivers, lagoons, and eventually the sea. The color of the water suggests the presence of cyanobacteria, a type of algae that multiplies in unhealthy conditions with high sewage levels.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organisation has declared a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea after the virus was found in two healthy children during routine screening. Less than half of the country's population is immunised against the potentially deadly disease. The WHO has called for an immediate vaccination campaign to achieve 100% coverage, targeting children aged 10 and below. The virus strain is genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia, and health officials are working to dispel misinformation and encourage vaccination.</p>

He praised Dubai's safety and multicultural success, advocating for similar values in the UK. Tice splits his time between Westminster, his constituency, and the UAE, where he visits his partner, journalist Isabel Oakeshott. However, critics point to Dubai's absolute monarchy and its poor ranking in civil liberties as reasons for caution when considering it as a model for the UK.</p>

          <p>Japan has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the ability to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law requires operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches. The government aims to be fully operational with these measures by 2027. The move reflects Japan's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capacity to levels comparable with the United States and major European nations.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year due to a sharp fall in exports. Uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies negatively impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. Despite the contraction, domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% in the same quarter. While the weak yen had provided a competitive advantage for Japan's exports, it was reportedly overpowered by China's machinery and tool exports.</p>
