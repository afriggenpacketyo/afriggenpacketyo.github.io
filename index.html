          <p>Grammy-winning R&B musician D'Angelo, born Michael Eugene Archer, has passed away at the age of 51 following a prolonged battle with cancer. His family confirmed his death in a statement, celebrating his legacy of extraordinarily moving music while asking for privacy. Known for iconic songs like "Brown Sugar" and "Untitled (How Does It Feel)," D'Angelo rose to prominence with his unique blend of soul, funk, and R&B. He got his start playing music in the Pentecostal church where his father was a preacher, an experience he credited for his musical growth.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump may impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods depending on Beijing's next steps in their dispute over rare earth minerals. China recently announced sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports, which are critical for U.S. defense, technology, and automotive industries. Greer stated that the U.S. cannot allow China to have "veto power" over global high-tech supply chains. While a meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping is still scheduled, its status remains uncertain amid the escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as quantitative tightening, may conclude in the coming months. Speaking at a conference, Powell indicated that the Fed is nearing its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for banks but offered no new guidance on the future direction of interest rates. He emphasized that the labor market is showing signs of softening, increasing the downside risks to employment. Powell also noted that a government shutdown has hampered the release of key economic data.</p>

          <p>China has implemented sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports, a move that directly threatens the U.S. defense industry and provides Beijing with powerful leverage in trade negotiations. These new rules specifically target the use of rare earths by foreign militaries, impacting critical components in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 fighter jet and Tomahawk missiles. The restrictions have reignited trade war tensions, as the U.S. is heavily dependent on China for these materials, controlling over 90% of global refining capacity.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is causing significant financial anxiety for military families, who are worried about potentially missing their next paycheck. Although the White House has stated it identified funds to pay service members, the uncertainty is stressful for households that often live paycheck to paycheck and have limited savings. Advocacy groups highlight that many military families rely on a single income, making any disruption in pay particularly damaging both financially and psychologically.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has identified recent bankruptcies in the automotive sector as an "early sign" that corporate lending standards have become too lax over the past decade. Speaking after the bank's earnings call, Dimon warned that a potential economic downturn could expose more widespread credit problems. His comments followed JPMorgan taking a $170 million charge-off from the failure of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, an episode Dimon called "not our finest moment."

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean dropped more than 8% after China imposed sanctions on five of its U.S.-based subsidiaries. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce accused the companies of assisting the U.S. government in its investigations into China's maritime and shipbuilding industries. The move, which prohibits Chinese entities from doing business with the sanctioned firms, marks a further escalation in the ongoing economic and geopolitical tensions between the United States and China.</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced it will absorb a $1.6 billion charge in its third-quarter results, reflecting a significant scaling back of its electric vehicle ambitions. The automaker attributed the decision to an expected slowdown in EV adoption, citing recent U.S. government policy changes that terminated certain consumer tax incentives. The financial impact includes $1.2 billion in noncash adjustments to its EV manufacturing capacity and $400 million in cash for contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements.

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was thrown into chaos after more than 1,300 employees were issued termination notices, only for about half of them to be reinstated over the weekend. While the Trump administration reportedly cited a coding error for the reversal, former officials believe it was a response to public backlash. Key operational units, such as the entire human resources department and the Washington office, remain eliminated, raising serious concerns about the agency's capacity to respond to public health crises.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer asserted in Parliament that his government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state was a contributing factor to the recent Gaza ceasefire agreement. While giving primary credit to the U.S. for brokering the deal, Starmer argued that the UK's diplomatic stance allowed it to effectively work "behind the scenes" to support the peace process. The Conservative opposition criticized the move, with leader Kemi Badenoch accusing the government of "rewarding terrorism" and diminishing UK influence.</p>
