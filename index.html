          <p>Fifty years after his disappearance on July 30, 1975, the fate of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa remains one of America's most captivating unsolved mysteries. The article recounts Hoffa's rise as a powerful and controversial labor leader, his clashes with federal authorities like Robert F. Kennedy, and his imprisonment for bribery. After his prison sentence was commuted, his efforts to reclaim power within the union are believed to have led to his vanishing after a planned meeting in a Detroit suburb. Despite numerous theories and searches, no definitive evidence of what happened to him has ever been found.</p>

The timepieces were stolen from Reeves' Hollywood Hills home in December 2023 during a series of high-profile burglaries. The watches were discovered during police raids in Santiago, Chile, which also uncovered a range of other stolen luxury goods. The recovery is part of a broader investigation into South American crime groups targeting affluent homes in the United States, with Chilean police having arrested 23 citizens linked to the burglaries.</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, in 2023. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig administered a lethal mix of arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline in his wife's protein shakes. The motive was presented as financial, involving a struggling dental practice and $4 million in life insurance, alongside Craig's extramarital affairs. Craig's internet search history for undetectable poisons was key evidence, and he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole for the premeditated crime.</p>

          <p>Following a five-day strike by resident doctors in England, the British Medical Association (BMA) and Health Secretary Wes Streeting have agreed to restart negotiations. The recent walkout, the twelfth since spring 2023, occurred after previous talks broke down. Streeting has indicated that the new discussions will focus on improving working conditions rather than increasing the latest pay offer. While expressing disappointment over the strike's impact on patients, the health secretary's offer to meet was accepted by the union, which hopes for a more tangible settlement offer this time.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement, which could see the EU import over $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years, is facing criticism from environmental organizations. Critics argue that the deal, primarily focused on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to replace Russian supplies, risks locking Europe into long-term fossil fuel dependency. This move is seen as a contradiction to the EU's Green Deal and its climate goals, which aim for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement is viewed by some as undermining the bloc's commitment to renewable energy and accelerating climate change.</p>

          <h2>White House Moves to End Tariff Exemption for Low-Value International Shipments</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended the "de minimis" rule, which previously allowed commercial packages valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. without facing tariffs. An executive order signed by President Trump will subject these low-value shipments to all applicable duties starting in late August. This policy change accelerates a provision in a recent bill that was set to repeal the exemption worldwide in 2027. The move is framed by the White House as a necessary action to protect American businesses, significantly altering the landscape for e-commerce and international shipping.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a new rule banning the use of the N-word and the C-word during its public meetings. The move is a response to years of disruptive and offensive tirades from a small number of public speakers who have used racial and misogynistic slurs. Under the new policy, speakers using the banned words will be warned and then removed if they persist, with the possibility of being barred from future meetings. The decision has already sparked threats of legal challenges from critics who argue it infringes on 1st Amendment free speech rights.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing ongoing uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly regarding the impact of tariffs. The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that while the economy remains in good shape, the central bank is adopting a cautious "wait-and-see" approach. This hold on rates comes despite pressure from President Trump for the Fed to implement cuts to stimulate the economy further. (not investment advice)</p>
