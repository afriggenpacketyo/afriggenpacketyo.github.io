          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate.

Mr. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options, and experts suggest that survival rates for men with similar diagnoses have significantly improved in recent years.

          <p>Anduril Industries, co-founded by Palmer Luckey, is developing autonomous weapons, including the Fury unmanned fighter jet, designed to use artificial intelligence and fly without a pilot. Brian Schrimpf, Anduril's CEO, showcased Fury, a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) that works in coordination with a manned aircraft. Fury is designed to detect enemies earlier and protect manned aircraft, with components that are readily available and cheaper to mass produce. The Air Force hopes to have CCAs fully operational before the end of this decade, representing a new way of fighting.</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril, believes AI-powered, autonomous weapons are the future of warfare and is working to remake the U.S. military with his technology. Luckey argues that autonomous weapons promote peace by deterring adversaries and that they are less scary than weapons systems without any level of intelligence. Anduril's weapons, which include the Roadrunner drone interceptor and the Dive XL submarine, are designed to operate using artificial intelligence and can be synchronized on Anduril's AI platform, Lattice. Luckey says the company will have secured more than $6 billion in government contracts worldwide by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its spying efforts in the U.S., targeting pro-democracy activists and leveraging a worldwide network of covert agents to monitor and influence events. China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) is the largest and most active spy agency in the world, committed to going after the United States. The MSS might have as many as 600,000 employees, according to one estimate. The Department of Justice has indicted more than 140 people for felonies related to harassment, hacking, and spying for China within the U.S. over the last five years.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country's main spy agency, is actively recruiting spies in the U.S. The MSS spies on Chinese nationals living abroad in a few ways. First, it surveils WeChat, a Chinese instant messaging and social media app used by more than 1 billion people worldwide. In addition to monitoring online activity, Chinese intelligence agents have also infiltrated college campuses in the U.S. China's MSS uses many of the same techniques as other spy agencies: sex, money, and revenge.</p>
