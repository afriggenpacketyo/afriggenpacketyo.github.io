          <p>Zia Yusuf, who had resigned as Reform UK chairman, is returning to the party in a new role leading the "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf had cited that working to get the party elected was no longer a good use of his time, but now regrets his actions, blaming exhaustion from 11 months of hard work. Reform leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will take on a more public role and appear more frequently in the media. Before his resignation, Yusuf had criticized Sarah Pochin's stance on banning the burka, clarifying that it is not Reform party policy; his return signifies a renewed commitment to the party's goals.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant. Garcia's attorney argues that his client is being punished before having a chance to defend himself, calling it an abuse of power. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in a human smuggling ring that transported migrants, including MS-13 members, from Latin America to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring, reversing previous cuts made by the council. The agreement ensures that funds will be identified for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days. Restoring the police recruits would require an additional $13.3 million for the coming year and about $60 million in 2026-27. The mayor thanked the council for their collaboration in working towards making Los Angeles safer.</p>
