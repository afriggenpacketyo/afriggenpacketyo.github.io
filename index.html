          <p>Following the murder of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, and the wounding of another lawmaker and his wife, members of Congress are calling for increased security measures. Senators will receive a briefing from law enforcement on safety protocols. House Republicans held a tense conference call to voice their concerns about safety in their home districts and request additional protection, particularly police presence outside their homes. The suspect, Vance Boelter, faces multiple federal charges for the attacks, which prosecutors described as "political assassinations;" he allegedly possessed a list of 45 elected officials. The incident has heightened concerns about political violence and the safety of elected officials, leading to calls for a reevaluation of security measures.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has postponed his planned trip to Israel, where he was scheduled to address the Knesset, due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Johnson emphasized his staunch support for Israel, referencing the phrase "Never Again." The U.S. State Department has elevated its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, urging Americans not to travel there due to the ongoing armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. The security situation in Israel, including major cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, is unpredictable, and the U.S. government is advising citizens to remain vigilant and take necessary security precautions.

          <p>AMD shares experienced a significant rise after Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target, citing optimism about the chipmaker's latest product announcements. The analysts foresee a "snapback" for AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter, expecting the company to have navigated the financial impact of new U.S. license requirements affecting semiconductor exports to China. AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack designed for AI customers.

          <p>Investing $400,000 in an immediate fixed annuity at age 65 can yield monthly payments ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, contingent on factors like gender and payout option. These payouts are shaped by factors such as gender, life expectancy, the interest rate environment, and the annuity's structure. While annuities provide a guaranteed income stream, they also involve trade-offs such as reduced liquidity and limited potential for higher returns compared to other investments. The decision to invest in an annuity should be made after carefully assessing one's overall financial situation, retirement goals, and need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey has revealed that the ethnicity of individuals involved in grooming gangs has been "shied away from" by authorities in England and Wales. The report found that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang perpetrators, hindering accurate assessments. While the report acknowledged that there was evidence to show a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds amongst suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation in certain police forces, it criticized the "failure" of authorities to fully understand the nature and scale of the problem to date.
