        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small business owners are reportedly scaling back on hiring due to tariff-related cost increases. Companies are looking to cut costs, including labor, by pausing hiring, reducing hours, and even laying off staff. This trend is particularly pronounced among smaller enterprises that lack the financial reserves of larger corporations. Owners are struggling with rising wholesale prices and weaker consumer demand, making it difficult to maintain profitability. (not investment advice)</p>
