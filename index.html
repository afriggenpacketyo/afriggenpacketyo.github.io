          <p>The budget retail chain Poundland has been sold to US investment firm Gordon Brothers for Â£1 after struggling to compete with other discount stores, leading to sales declines in January and February. The sale by Polish firm Pepco includes a proposed restructure that could result in up to 100 store closures across Poundland's 825 UK locations, impacting approximately 16,000 employees. Pepco, which has owned Poundland since 2016, decided to auction the brand after sales slumped over the past year, effectively offloading an unprofitable part of its business. Despite the challenges, Pepco maintains that Poundland remains a popular brand with millions of annual customers.</p>

          <p>An Air India passenger plane, Flight AI171, crashed shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad Airport en route to London's Gatwick Airport, according to reports from Indian media. The airline confirmed that the flight was "involved in an incident" and stated that they were working to ascertain the details, though there was no immediate confirmation of casualties. Live flight tracking data showed the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, capable of carrying over 250 passengers, traveling southwest from the airport before the signal was lost.

Despite heightened regional tensions, a U.S. official confirmed that the U.S. delegation still plans to attend, and Iran's foreign minister expressed optimism about reaching a mutually beneficial outcome where Iran continues its enrichment program under IAEA supervision.

Oracle anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $1.46 and $1.50 for the upcoming fiscal first quarter, with revenue growth projected in the 12% to 14% range, driven by significant growth in cloud infrastructure revenue.

          <p>Council tax is projected to increase by 5% annually to fund local services, including policing, according to documents in the Spending Review. Local authorities have the autonomy to raise the tax by up to 4.99% each year without central government approval, and the Spending Review assumes councils will maximize this increase. This forms part of the government's calculations for an average 2.3% annual real-terms increase in "police spending power." The Spending Review indicates that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will face a 1.4% real-terms cut in its day-to-day budget, although the government asserts that councils' "core spending power" will still rise if they increase council tax to the maximum extent.</p>

He emphasized that despite strained resources, Illinois remains committed to public safety, investing in state and local law enforcement.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise argues this codifies President Trump's cuts to "woke public broadcasting," while critics worry about the impact on emergency communications, news coverage, and rural communities.

Strategies include using flood-resistant building materials like tile floors and cement board, elevating homes, and obtaining flood insurance. Elevating electrical outlets can prevent short circuits and fires. While these adaptations can be costly, they can mitigate the extensive damage caused by flooding, such as warped floors, swollen drywall, and damaged electrical systems. Considering the costs of climate change, flood insurance and preparation become essential for homeowners and renters in vulnerable areas.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are voicing resistance to a House GOP plan that would eliminate clean energy tax credits enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Several GOP senators, including Lisa Murkowski and John Curtis, caution against a "full-scale repeal of current credits," citing concerns about uncertainty for businesses that have already invested in domestic energy production.

The administration cites an "improved security situation" and "stabilizing economy" in Afghanistan, but this claim is widely disputed, with the State Department advising against travel to Afghanistan due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism.

The survey, which polled over 28,000 people in 24 countries, found that many have downgraded their ratings of the U.S., and describe Trump as "arrogant" and "dangerous". Experts suggest that the low ratings stem from a desire for a more collaborative and engaged America, as opposed to one that acts unilaterally. However, some respondents viewed Trump as a strong leader, and ratings of the U.S. have improved in Israel, Nigeria, and Turkey.</p>

          <p>Federal officials appear to be reversing the layoffs of over 400 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees, months after they were abruptly dismissed as part of an agency reduction in force. The action could reinstate the entire staff of a viral hepatitis laboratory and most employees in one of the CDC's environmental health divisions. Employees received emails indicating the revocation of their layoff notices, though the reason for the reversal remains unclear. The initial layoffs had disrupted disease surveillance efforts and caused logistical challenges for affected employees, with reactions to the news being mixed among CDC staff.</p>

          <h2>ICE's Arrest Strategy Inside Immigration Courts Sparks Controversy</h2>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is employing a new strategy of arresting migrants at immigration courts after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dismisses their cases, leading to expedited removals. This tactic has caught judges and lawyers off guard, with the Executive Office for Immigration Review detailing the approach in a recent email to judges. Critics argue that this strategy bypasses the legal system, denying individuals a fair day in court, while ICE maintains it is following the law by placing those who entered the U.S. illegally into expedited removal proceedings. The policy has instilled fear among immigrants, as they may face arrest and deportation even while attempting to comply with legal processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in a bill passed by the House could significantly reduce the retirement income of federal employees, impacting those who retire before age 62. The bill would eliminate a special retirement supplement for federal employees younger than 57 on January 1, 2028, potentially costing retirees like Michele Santa Maria, a 35-year government employee, tens of thousands of dollars. Supporters of the cut argue that federal retirement benefits are too generous, while opponents contend that they serve as an important retention tool for the government. The potential changes have sparked concerns among federal employees and advocacy groups, who argue it breaks a promise made to those who dedicated their careers to public service.</p>

          <p>The global nuclear watchdog has determined that Iran has failed to meet its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years. This finding follows a report from the IAEA citing a lack of cooperation from Iran and raising concerns over secret activities and undeclared nuclear material. A resolution passed by the IAEA board of governors carries the threat of an eventual referral to the UN Security Council, which could further complicate talks between Iran and the US over a new nuclear agreement. The IAEA report said Iran had stockpiled more than 408kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, near weapons grade, which would be enough to make nine nuclear bombs.</p>

          <p>Guardian columnist Zoe Williams argues that despite the risks, protesting against authoritarianism is essential. Drawing on Hannah Arendt's insights, Williams notes that while protests can be used by rulers to justify displays of force, abandoning protest altogether leads to moral corruption. Williams emphasizes that the recent protests in Los Angeles against immigration raids are not symbolic but a direct response to protect communities from unjust actions. The choice is between protesting and allowing the raids to proceed, highlighting the importance of action over despair.</p>
