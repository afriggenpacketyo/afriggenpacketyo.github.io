          <p>Columbia University will pay $200 million and submit to federal monitoring to resolve claims of discriminating against Jewish students. The settlement, made with the Trump administration, restores access to federal grants that were at risk. While the university does not admit wrongdoing, it has acknowledged that Jewish students and faculty faced unacceptable incidents and that reforms are necessary. This agreement follows a period of intense campus protests and scrutiny over the university's handling of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is attributed to strong global demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components in AI systems for clients like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence in sustained demand for the remainder of 2025, solidifying its leadership position over rivals in the competitive HBM market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. The motion passed with bipartisan support, as three Republican members joined Democrats, defying their party's leadership. Republicans amended the subpoena to also include communications between Biden administration officials and the DOJ concerning Epstein. This action reflects growing pressure for transparency following a recent DOJ review that claimed no incriminating "client list" existed.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly accelerating its development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as a key strategy in its ambition for global AI dominance. According to a presentation by Georgetown experts, China is exploring invasive and non-invasive methods to merge human cognition with machines, a different approach from the U.S. focus on large language models. This effort is part of a broader, state-funded push to achieve artificial general intelligence and has raised concerns among U.S. officials about the geopolitical and ethical implications.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media indicates that a majority of teenagers are now using AI chatbots for companionship, advice, and emotional support. While some teens find it helpful for minor decisions, researchers express concern that this trend could hinder the development of real-world social skills and deepen youth loneliness. The study highlights that many teens find conversations with AI as satisfying as talking to human friends, raising questions about the long-term impact of these unregulated technologies on adolescent mental health.</p>

An increase in housing inventory, with sellers outnumbering buyers at the highest rate since 2013, is contributing to this change. However, record-high median sale prices, driven by homeowners with low-rate mortgages staying put, continue to create challenges for prospective buyers. Experts advise that opportunities may lie in properties that have been on the market longer or require renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against conservative influencer Candace Owens. The suit alleges Owens has maliciously spread false conspiracy theories, including the claim that Mrs. Macron was born male. The Macrons' attorneys stated that Owens refused repeated requests for a retraction, leaving legal action as their only recourse. Owens has publicly dismissed the lawsuit, standing by her claims and describing the legal action as a public relations strategy.</p>

          <p>In the first six months of his second term, President Trump has aggressively reshaped U.S. immigration policy, fulfilling campaign promises of a mass deportation campaign. Fueled by a historic domestic enforcement budget passed by Congress, the administration has intensified efforts to remove migrants living in the country illegally. This NPR analysis notes that the "shock and awe" approach to immigration represents one of the most significant and rapid policy shifts under the current administration. The changes have been swift and far-reaching, impacting communities across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, is not about legitimate monetary policy disagreements but a dangerous attempt at "fiscal dominance." The author contends the administration wants the central bank to keep interest rates low to accommodate massive government borrowing and spending, a hallmark of unstable economies. While acknowledging Powell's own policy missteps, the piece warns that politicizing the Fed to mask unsustainable fiscal policy will ultimately lead to inflation, stagnation, and a loss of confidence in U.S. debt.

          <p>IBM's stock price dropped after the company reported that its second-quarter software revenue missed analyst expectations, even though overall earnings and revenue were higher than projected. The company's revenue grew nearly 8% year-over-year, with strong performance in its consulting and infrastructure divisions. However, CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients were reprioritizing their spending toward hardware, and geopolitical tensions were causing cautious behavior. IBM maintained its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a drop in second-quarter profit and revenue that fell below Wall Street estimates, posting a net income of $213 million, down 42% from last year. However, the airline noted that travel demand has stabilized and announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. The carrier is in the midst of a major business model overhaul, including the recent introduction of assigned seating, which it says has impacted sales of its new basic economy fares. The company projects its third-quarter unit revenue will be relatively flat compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A heated debate occurred in the White House press briefing room between CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Collins questioned whether Gabbard's recent declassification of intelligence related to the 2016 election was an attempt to improve her standing with President Trump, who had previously undermined her assessments. Gabbard and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back, with Leavitt asserting that the president has the "utmost confidence" in Gabbard. The exchange highlighted ongoing tensions between the press corps and the Trump administration over the motives behind intelligence releases.</p>

          <p>A search warrant affidavit reveals that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's bomb squad technicians who died in a recent explosion initially believed the grenades they were handling were inert. The technicians had X-rayed the devices at the scene before transporting them to a training academy for disposal. The following day, at least one of the grenades detonated, killing three veteran detectives in the department's deadliest incident in over 150 years. The investigation by the sheriff's homicide bureau and the ATF is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the detonation.</p>

The company's financial struggles and volatile stock performance in 2025 have been linked to increased competition and backlash over CEO Elon Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration, which has negatively impacted the brand's perception.
