        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Republican representatives, led by Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, has reintroduced a proposal for a constitutional amendment to prevent members of Congress from receiving their salaries during a government shutdown. The proposed amendment argues that if federal workers are impacted by funding lapses, lawmakers should not be exempt from financial consequences for their inaction. This legislative push, which would also prohibit any back pay for the shutdown period, comes as the nation faces an imminent partial government shutdown due to a deadlock between Republicans and Democrats on a new spending agreement. The sponsors believe this measure would incentivize Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to fund the government.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive investigation has identified at least 170 U.S. hospitals, encompassing nearly 30,000 patient beds, that are at major risk of significant flooding, a threat often understated by official FEMA maps. The analysis, using advanced flood simulation data, reveals that these facilities could have patient care jeopardized, emergency rooms blocked, and evacuations forced by intense storms. The article highlights that these risks are exacerbated by a changing climate and points to Trump administration policies that have reportedly dismantled federal programs designed to protect critical infrastructure from floods. Experts warn that without adequate preparation and information, these vulnerable hospitals pose a severe public health danger.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced photos on Chinese social media appear to show a new, tailless fighter jet, believed to be the developmental J-50 sixth-generation stealth aircraft. The images are notable because the aircraft is seen without the nose-mounted air data boom, a sensor typically used during the early stages of flight testing. According to Chinese military observers, the removal of this testing equipment could signify that the development program has reached a more advanced stage. While the authenticity of the images has not been officially confirmed by Chinese authorities, they have sparked considerable discussion about the progress of China's advanced military aviation technology.</p>

          <h2>Affordable Care Act Premiums Could More Than Double if Enhanced Subsidies Expire, Analysis Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 05:58:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan research group KFF warns that health insurance premiums for 22 million Americans on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace will increase by an average of 114% in 2026 if enhanced subsidies are not extended. These subsidies, which were expanded during the pandemic and are set to expire at the end of 2025, are a central point of contention in the current government funding stalemate. The potential expiration would significantly raise out-of-pocket costs for enrollees across all income levels, compounding financial pressure amid proposed insurer rate hikes. Democrats are pushing to include an extension in the funding deal, while Republicans prefer to negotiate it separately. (not investment advice)</p>

The ceremony, part of a major Hindu festival, saw her paraded through the streets before beginning her sequestered life as a deity. While the position brings great honor to her family, former Kumaris have historically faced challenges readjusting to normal life after their tenure ends.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that the United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, thanks to a successful and long-running vaccination program. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that high vaccination rates among both boys and girls have led to a dramatic decline in infections from cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women. This indirect protection suggests a strong community-level defense against the virus. However, experts caution that maintaining this progress is contingent on sustaining high vaccine uptake, as waning vaccination rates could reverse these public health gains.</p>

          <p>China has launched a new "K-visa" program designed to attract foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields by removing the need for local employer sponsorship. However, the initiative has triggered significant online backlash from Chinese citizens who fear it will disadvantage local graduates in an already challenging job market. Critics on social media platforms like Weibo argue the policy could lead to fraudulent applications and exacerbate unemployment pressures. In response, state media has defended the program as necessary for acquiring high-level talent to advance China's technological ambitions, dismissing public concerns as narrow-minded.</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new record high as the United States government officially entered a shutdown, increasing investor anxiety and demand for safe-haven assets. The shutdown introduces significant market uncertainty, particularly as it will delay the release of critical U.S. jobs data, complicating the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions. Analysts suggest that while the shutdown was the immediate catalyst, the rally is also fueled by broader geopolitical instability, ongoing conflicts, and sticky inflation, leading some to predict that gold prices could climb even higher. This trend reflects a broader investor strategy to diversify portfolios with hard assets amid global volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The survey also revealed deep partisan divides on issues such as deploying the National Guard to cities and whether violence against public officials or protesters is the greater concern.</p>

          <h2>Republican Efforts to Restrict Voting by Overseas U.S. Citizens Intensify Ahead of Midterms</h2>

          <p>Republican officials are escalating efforts to impose new restrictions on voting by U.S. citizens living abroad, including military members and their families, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The push includes lawsuits in swing states like Arizona and proposed legislation at both state and federal levels, primarily targeting citizens born abroad who have never resided in the U.S. The RNC argues that allowing these individuals to vote dilutes the power of domestic voters, while voting rights advocates contend these moves disenfranchise Americans, particularly the children of those serving the country overseas. These actions create significant uncertainty for the millions of eligible overseas voters.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Magical Origins of the Word 'Hoax'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax," used to describe grand deceptions and frauds, has a fascinating origin rooted in the world of magic. Etymologists trace the term to a clipped version of "hocus pocus," an incantation popularized in the 1620s by a magician named William Vincent, who used it as his stage name. The phrase "hocus pocus" itself is theorized to be a deliberate, playful corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum" ("This is My body"), reflecting the anti-Catholic sentiment in England at the time. Over time, the magician's brand name became shorthand for trickery, eventually evolving into the modern word "hoax" around the 19th century.</p>

          <p>New data from the banking trade body UK Finance reveals a significant shift in consumer behavior, with half of all adults in the UK now regularly using mobile payment services like Apple Pay and Google Pay. This marks a substantial increase from 34% in the previous year, with the trend showing strong growth across all age groups, not just younger demographics. The convenience of tapping a phone or watch for contactless payments has led to a slight dip in the use of physical contactless cards. While digital payments are becoming increasingly mainstream, the report notes that cash usage continues to decline, raising concerns about financial inclusion and system resilience.</p>

          <p>A group of law students from Vanuatu, known as Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC), has been awarded the prestigious Right Livelihood Award for their groundbreaking efforts in climate justice. The students successfully campaigned to bring the issue of climate change obligations before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which resulted in a landmark advisory opinion confirming that countries are legally bound to address climate change. The award, often called the "alternative Nobel Prize," recognizes their achievement in transforming the fight for survival into a matter of legal rights and responsibilities for nations worldwide.

          <p>A Nigerian man, who was part of a group of West Africans deported from the U.S. to Ghana, claims that he and five others were secretly and illegally moved across the border into Togo by Ghanaian officers. The man alleges they were told they were being moved to better accommodations but were instead abandoned in the neighboring country without documentation. This incident is part of the controversial U.S. "third-country deportation" policy, which Ghana had agreed to in a spirit of "pan-African empathy." The deportee, now stranded in a hotel in Lomé, fears returning to Nigeria due to his political activism and is struggling to survive in a country where he has no connections.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Bureau of Investigation has announced it will conduct a review of the 2005 death of acclaimed journalist and author Hunter S. Thompson. The review was initiated at the request of his widow, Anita Thompson, to provide an independent perspective on the original investigation, which concluded his death from a gunshot wound was a suicide. While law enforcement officials state there is no new evidence suggesting foul play, they hope a fresh look at the case will offer peace of mind to his family and the public. Thompson, a pioneer of "Gonzo journalism," was best known for his novel "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."</p>

Hayes recently guided the U.S. team to a gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, solidifying her status as one of the most successful coaches in the sport.

          <p>A growing scandal in Australia has seen 18 sunscreen products pulled from shelves over concerns that they do not provide their claimed level of sun protection. An investigation by the country's medicines regulator, the TGA, found that a shared base formula used in over 20 sunscreens was unlikely to have an SPF greater than 21, with some potentially as low as four, despite being labeled as high as SPF 50+. The inquiry also raised significant concerns about the testing practices of a U.S.-based laboratory used by many of the brands. This issue is particularly alarming for Australia, which has the world's highest rate of skin cancer.</p>

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025 alone, with all top-fee moves going to clubs in England's Women's Super League (WSL) or the U.S. National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). While this signals a positive injection of capital into the sport, it also highlights a widening financial gap between these elite leagues and others, like Germany's Bundesliga. The disparity is driven by more lucrative broadcasting and sponsorship deals in the U.S. and England, allowing their clubs to dominate the transfer market. This trend threatens to entrench the competitive advantage of a few wealthy leagues, leaving others behind in the sport's rapid commercial growth.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has put forward a framework agreement to end the war in Gaza, which has gained significant momentum with backing from key Arab nations and an initial acceptance from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The plan, which gives Hamas a short deadline to respond, resembles a previous Biden administration proposal and is the first time Trump has applied significant pressure on Israel to end the conflict. However, its primary weakness is a characteristic lack of detail, leading to conflicting interpretations; Netanyahu has already publicly contradicted the plan's mention of a potential pathway to a Palestinian state, creating ambiguity that could easily derail future negotiations.</p>
