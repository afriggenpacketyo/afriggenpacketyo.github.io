          <p>Former President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to support a megabill advancing his legislative agenda, particularly cautioning against changes to Medicaid. Trump reportedly used strong language to emphasize his point, as hard-liners push for stricter Medicaid cuts. Another sticking point is a cap on state and local tax deductions, with Trump advising Republicans to accept the current deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the bill, decrying it as the largest cut to Medicaid and nutritional assistance in American history. The ABC News article notes Trump warned Republicans they could be primaried if they vote against his bill.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, has been arrested and charged for allegedly assisting 10 inmates in a brazen escape from a New Orleans jail. According to the Louisiana attorney general’s office, Williams shut off water to the jail, enabling the inmates to remove a toilet and sink fixture from a cell wall. The inmates then used a tool to cut steel bars, creating an escape route, and left a taunting message. Sheriff Susan Hutson stated that the escape involved procedural failures and intentional wrongdoings, indicating a coordinated effort aided by insiders, and officials are continuing the investigation. The New York Times article also notes that the jail has defective locks and doors, and about a third of the cameras don't work. </p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was unable to convince key House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill due to disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The 'SALT Caucus' opposes the bill, arguing it doesn't adequately address their constituents' tax concerns. A proposal to raise the deduction to $30,000 was deemed insufficient by some GOP lawmakers. The CNBC article notes that voter unhappiness with the current cap on the deduction could affect Republican chances of retaining control in the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Medical experts discussed former President Joe Biden’s recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 and metastasis to the bone. The cancer is classified as hormone-sensitive, potentially making it more responsive to hormone therapies. Androgen deprivation therapy, aimed at reducing testosterone levels, is a common treatment. Eventually, metastatic prostate cancer can become hormone-resistant, requiring alternative treatments.
