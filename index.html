          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 12:51:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has indicated that he plans to scale back his political donations significantly, marking a shift from his substantial involvement in the 2024 election cycle, where he heavily supported Donald Trump's campaign. Speaking at an economic conference in Qatar, Musk stated he feels he has "done enough" and doesn't foresee immediate reasons for future political spending. This decision follows backlash and violent attacks on Tesla cars due to his political activities, which included working in the White House on federal spending cuts and facing scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest involving his companies like Starlink and X. Musk defended his past actions, stating he "did what needed to be done," despite the personal and professional repercussions. </p>

          <p>The European Union is preparing to introduce a €2 (US$2.25) flat fee on low-value packages entering the bloc, predominantly originating from China. This fee aims to address challenges arising from the large influx of inexpensive items and will be levied on e-commerce platforms per parcel. The customs-free status of packages valued under €150 (US$168.75) imported directly to consumers will be removed, targeting platforms such as Temu and Shein. A lower fee of 50 cents will apply to parcels sent directly to warehouses within the EU. Last year, the EU processed 4.6 billion such small packages, with expectations for this number to increase. </p>

          <p>The Washington, D.C. home of U.S. Navy Secretary John Phelan was damaged in a fire on Monday, according to U.S. officials. The house, which was purchased last month for $8.6 million, was undergoing renovations and unoccupied at the time of the incident. The fire broke out twice within 24 hours, with the second blaze engulfing all three floors of the English manor-style mansion. D.C. Fire Chief John Donnelly attributed the cause of the fire to an electrical event. Phelan, a former businessman, was nominated to be Navy secretary after founding a private investment firm and co-founding MSD Capital, LP. </p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched an investigation into U.S. Master's Swimming (USMS) after a transgender athlete, Ana Caldas, won five women's events at a competition in San Antonio. The investigation was prompted by concerns that USMS's policy allowing transgender swimmers to compete in the gender category they identify with violates Texas law, specifically the Save Women's Sports Act, which bans transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. Wendy Enderle, a female swimmer, requested an eligibility review after learning that she was unknowingly competing against a transgender athlete and hopes the Department of Justice will take action as well. USMS policy requires hormonal therapy and specific testosterone serum levels for trans swimmers to be recognized for accomplishments, but allows participation regardless. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and individuals at higher risk of severe disease, but will mandate vaccine manufacturers to conduct extensive new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision may limit access to updated shots for many Americans without underlying conditions. The FDA will require randomized, placebo-controlled trials before approving future applications for shots to all healthy persons between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. This new regulatory framework, spearheaded by the FDA's new leadership, comes ahead of a key meeting to decide on updating the strain used in next season's shots. </p>

          <p>Walmart has shifted its stance on President Donald Trump's tariffs, warning that higher duties on imports will lead to increased prices for shoppers. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is beyond what any retailer can absorb. This warning carries risk, given Trump's history of publicly attacking companies perceived to oppose his agenda. Walmart responded to Trump's criticism by reiterating its commitment to maintaining low prices. Other companies, such as Microsoft and Subaru, have also cautioned about price increases related to tariffs. </p>

          <p>A $25,000 annuity can provide a modest, guaranteed monthly income stream, ranging from approximately $100 to $180, depending on factors such as age, gender, and the type of annuity. While this may not significantly impact retirement savings, it can offer a supplemental income for covering specific expenses like utilities or prescriptions. However, it's important to consider the trade-offs, such as limited liquidity and potential for growth, before investing. A $25,000 annuity may be a suitable option for those seeking a safe, predictable income source, but a larger investment or alternative strategies may be more appropriate for those prioritizing flexibility or growth.

          <p>Sterling Williams, a maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail, has been arrested and charged with assisting 10 inmates in their escape. Williams allegedly shut off the water supply, allowing the inmates to remove a toilet and sink fixture from a cell wall, creating an escape route. He claims he was threatened by an inmate to turn off the water. The inmates then used a tool to cut steel bars behind the sink. Four of the escapees have been captured, while a manhunt continues for the remaining six. </p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland could receive up to £70 each after a court ruled that historic fees charged by Mastercard were unfair. Consumers are eligible to claim compensation if they lived in the specified regions for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008 (May 1992 for Scotland) and bought goods or services from UK businesses that accepted Mastercard credit cards. The judgement allocates £100m for consumers, with payments capped at £70 per claimant if fewer than 2.5 million people apply. The claim was launched after the European Commission ruled in 2007 that Mastercard's fees had infringed competition law since 1992. </p>
