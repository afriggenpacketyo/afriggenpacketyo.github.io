          <p>Facing declining consumer spending in the U.S. due to unfavorable trade policies, Temu and Shein are shifting their focus to Europe and the UK as critical growth markets. However, they are encountering regulatory headwinds similar to those in the U.S., including a proposed €2 customs fee by the EU, which could significantly impact their operations. The companies are boosting ad spending and expanding warehouse capacity in Europe, but stricter regulations on product safety, consumer protection, and fair competition pose challenges. The EU is investigating Shein's compliance with consumer law, while complaints have been filed against both platforms for deceptive business tactics, signaling potential future pressures. Optimism surrounding these companies is low given the global economic climate and the new tariffs being placed on them.</p>

          <p>China's efforts to strengthen ties with Niger's military government following the 2023 coup are facing challenges due to disputes over labor practices and regulatory compliance. Despite providing a substantial financial lifeline to Niger in the form of an oil-backed loan, relations have been strained by the expulsion of Chinese oil executives and the revocation of a Chinese-owned hotel's license. This situation underscores the limits of Beijing's non-interference policy, which, while intended to avoid entanglement in domestic affairs, can incur economic costs as nations experience a rise in nationalism. China's policy of regime strengthening can lead to economic complications when local interests and priorities diverge from Beijing's investments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan is lagging behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership roles. Despite setting a goal in 2003 to raise the share of women in leadership positions to about 30 percent by 2020, the target was later delayed due to insufficient progress. The report acknowledges that current efforts remain inadequate, as reflected in Japan's low ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. The government plans to intensify efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across various sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures suggest that UK companies are holding back on hiring or not replacing departing workers, leading to a decline in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate slightly increased. Feedback from a vacancies survey suggests that some firms may be hesitant to recruit new workers due to rising employment costs, including increased National Insurance Contributions and a rise in the minimum wage. This trend indicates a weakening in the labor market, with expectations that the unemployment rate will continue to rise over the coming year.</p>

Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while SEIU officials held a large protest in Washington, D.C., in support of Huerta's release.

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have increased by double-digit percentages, offsetting losses from high US tariffs. Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factory sites in Southeast Asia for local sale or re-export to Western countries, including the US. This diversification of exports reflects closer economic and investment relations between China and Southeast Asian nations, although some exports may be transshipped to avoid US tariffs.</p>

          <p>Europe's tighter border controls and anti-smuggling policies are inadvertently strengthening organized crime groups, as migrants become more reliant on smugglers to facilitate their journeys to Western Europe. Violence linked to immigration crime is increasing in Serbia and along the Western Balkans route, with smuggling groups fighting over territory and clients. Smugglers are charging exponential prices, up to €15,000 to transit from Turkey to Germany and France, exploiting the closure of migrant reception centers and stricter border enforcement. This situation leaves migrants more vulnerable to exploitation and violence, as they must rely on smugglers for every step of their journey.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States plan to hold summit talks between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in Canada on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in mid-June. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa will visit Washington for the sixth round of ministerial-level negotiations on the Trump tariffs. Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced tariff rates due to the United States' refusal to eliminate them entirely. The two countries aim to reach a deal as early as possible, focusing on boosting investment and reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recall on cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA due to a serious health risk, as the cans labeled 'zero sugar' were found to contain the full amount of sugar present in a regular can. The recalled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, have the product code XXXXRS05165 with a “best by” date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, such as diabetics, as consuming the product could lead to hyperglycemia. Customers who purchased the affected cans are urged to return them for a full refund or dispose of them.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in European regulations to smuggle ketamine, leading to a rise in its illegal sale and consumption. Smugglers are taking advantage of the drug's classification as a legal medicine in some countries by transporting it across multiple borders to confuse authorities. In one case, a consignment of ketamine was switched for salt between Amsterdam and Brussels, highlighting the elaborate methods used by crime gangs. The increasing profitability of ketamine has led some gangs to focus on it over other illegal drugs, prompting calls for greater international cooperation to tackle the problem.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb the elevated prices of the country's staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the aim of selling the 2020 rice at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks in March and April. The government aims to ensure that the cheaper rice reaches consumers quickly to bring down overall prices.</p>

          <p>The Florida Panthers delivered a decisive 6-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final, taking a 2-1 series lead. Brad Marchand and Sam Bennett continued their scoring streak, while Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe each scored their first goals of the final. Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar goaltending and the Oilers' penalty troubles contributed to Florida's dominant performance.
