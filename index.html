          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire on July 9. A spokesperson stated the deadline is not critical and the president could extend it, particularly if trading partners like Japan continue to negotiate in good faith. This comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, aiming to secure concessions on the higher duties imposed by the Trump administration. Japan currently faces a potential combined tariff rate of 24 percent under the proposed scheme. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ecuadorian authorities have recaptured JosÃ© Adolfo MacÃ­as, the fugitive drug trafficker known as 'Fito' who is also wanted by the United States. MacÃ­as, leader of the 'Los Choneros' gang, was found hiding in a house in Manta, Ecuador, more than a year after his escape from a Guayaquil prison. His 2024 escape triggered a wave of violence across the nation, including riots, kidnappings, and an armed attack on a live television broadcast, prompting the government to declare war on drug mafias. U.S. prosecutors have indicted him on charges of importing large quantities of cocaine and smuggling firearms.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren SÃ¡nchez are holding their wedding celebration in Venice, Italy, drawing a high-profile crowd of celebrities for events beginning on Thursday. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Tom Brady were seen arriving, with around 200 people expected to attend the weekend's festivities. The influx of famous personalities has sparked some local protests under the 'No Space for Bezos' campaign, which aligns with broader European concerns about over-tourism and rising living costs. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and SÃ¡nchez, 55, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019.</p>

          <p>A new vaccine advisory committee, established by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted to recommend against the use of flu vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal, despite its established safety record. The panel also approved a new RSV shot for newborns, adding another option for parents. The committee's actions, which included bypassing the CDC's standard review process, have drawn criticism from medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics. They warn that re-debating settled science could undermine public trust in vaccines and fuel misinformation, noting that 96% of flu shots are already thimerosal-free.</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have publicly questioned the Trump administration's claims that recent U.S. strikes resulted in the 'total obliteration' of Iran's nuclear program. Senators including Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated they believe significant nuclear capability remains, suggesting the program was set back by months, not years or decades as President Trump asserted. While acknowledging the military mission's success in causing extensive damage, they cautioned against a false sense of security. Conversely, Republican senators like Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton defended the administration's characterization, stating the strikes were effective and severely damaged Iran's facilities.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, the company's vice president of manufacturing and operations, as the automaker contends with declining car sales in key markets. Afshar, who reported directly to Musk, had previously been the subject of an internal investigation in 2022 but had since returned to a promoted role. The dismissal follows a 19% drop in Tesla's stock price this year and a fifth consecutive month of falling sales in Europe. The company has also faced reputational challenges linked to Musk's political activities and incendiary rhetoric, contributing to a difficult period for the electric vehicle manufacturer.</p>

          <p>In his first public remarks since a ceasefire, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory over Israel, claiming the country was 'crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.' Despite his assertions of significant damage to Israeli targets, Iran's missile attacks resulted in relatively few evaded rockets and 28 civilian deaths. U.S. and Israeli intelligence assessments indicate their combined strikes 'obliterated' Iran's nuclear program, a claim Khamenei dismissed. The IAEA has confirmed 'very significant physical damage' to three key nuclear sites and expressed concern over new Iranian legislation forbidding cooperation with its inspectors.</p>

          <p>The iconic saguaro cacti of Arizona's Sonoran Desert are succumbing to the effects of climate change, with rising temperatures pushing them to their survival limits. Researchers at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix report that the annual death rate for saguaros has surged from 1-2% to nearly 7% over the last five years, far outpacing their slow reproduction cycle. Extended periods of extreme heat, often exceeding 110 degrees, are causing the cacti to effectively suffer from heat stroke and collapse. Scientists are now working to identify and cultivate the most heat-resilient saguaro varieties to help ensure the long-term survival of this symbol of the American West.</p>

The proposed Republican spending package includes provisions for increased border wall funding, more detention centers, and expedited deportations, aiming for at least one million per year.

          <p>The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched an investigation into a crane collapse at SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas. The incident, which was captured on a livestream, adds to a history of workplace safety concerns at the company, which has previously reported injury rates exceeding the industry average. It is not yet clear if any workers were injured in the collapse. This event follows a series of explosions and setbacks for SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy rocket program. The investigation comes as the Trump administration, through a Musk-led initiative, has cut OSHA's resources and closed several of its field offices.</p>

As part of a plea deal, Navarro pleaded guilty to a single felony count, which will forfeit his right to vote or hold public office.</p>

The legislation, which extends first-term tax cuts and boosts immigration enforcement funding, faces unified Democratic opposition over cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs. A recent ruling by the Senate parliamentarian struck a key provision, potentially increasing the bill's cost and making it less palatable to fiscally conservative Republicans. With several moderate GOP senators still undecided, it is unclear if the bill can pass before the July 4th deadline Trump has imposed.</p>

The sneaker giant plans to fully mitigate this cost over time by adjusting its supply chain, working with partners, and implementing price increases. The company is already reducing its manufacturing presence in China from 16% to the high single digits. Despite a tough quarter where profits fell 86% amid a major turnaround plan, Nike's earnings beat Wall Street expectations, and the company stated that the worst financial impacts of its business reset are now behind it.
