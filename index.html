          <p>A new BBC documentary investigates the history of the Jesus Fellowship, also known as the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical group that disbanded five years ago. The article details the findings of a years-long investigation, revealing hundreds of allegations of abuse, particularly the sexual assault of children who lived in the group's communal homes. The group's founder, Noel Stanton, was accused of being a "predatory paedophile," but died before facing the claims. The film explores the lasting trauma for survivors and the mechanisms of control used by the cult's leadership.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and announced plans for humanitarian corridors following intense international pressure over the territory's worsening starvation crisis. The move comes as reports of malnutrition-related deaths, including many children, have increased significantly. Aid organizations and world leaders have criticized Israel's restrictions on aid, which they say have created a man-made famine. Despite the new measures, UN officials warn that airdrops are inefficient and cannot replace the necessity of safe, large-scale aid delivery over land.</p>

          <p>An ambulance was involved in a two-vehicle collision at an intersection in Clifton, Colorado, on Saturday afternoon. The ambulance was reportedly transporting a patient at the time of the crash; that patient was safely transferred to another ambulance to continue to the hospital. No injuries resulting from the accident itself were reported by authorities. The incident, which is under investigation by the Colorado State Patrol, caused a temporary closure of westbound lanes on I-70B while the scene was cleared.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from residents of new property developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new buildings. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in vacant shops and encourage more outdoor dining and live performances. The government hopes these measures will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry.</p>

          <p>An attempt to recall 24 opposition lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, allowing the China-friendly KMT party and its allies to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature. The recall campaign was initiated by civic groups who accused the lawmakers of undermining national security and obstructing the government's agenda since the 2024 election. The failure of the vote means that the political gridlock between President William Lai's administration and the opposition-controlled parliament is likely to continue. The opposition argues it is providing necessary checks and balances, not sabotaging the government.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed how a convicted fraudster named James Kenny orchestrated a plan for a massive, non-existent music festival in Wales. Billed as Monmouth Rising, the event falsely claimed to feature major headliners like The Killers and to be backed by prominent investors, duping employees and suppliers. Kenny used his convincing pitch to draw people in, but the festival was built on lies, with no licenses filed or artists actually booked. The scheme unraveled when payments were missed, leaving employees and businesses out of pocket.</p>

Authorities determined he targeted the pair because they were Muslim, and his actions were a response to the war between Israel and Hamas. The attack drew global condemnation and highlighted a rise in anti-Muslim hostility in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a rapid descent of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision with another aircraft. The plane's onboard traffic alert system prompted the pilots to take evasive action shortly after takeoff. The other aircraft was identified as a decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The Southwest flight continued safely to its destination, but one flight attendant was transported to a hospital for minor injuries. The FAA has confirmed it is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>The legality of former President Trump's broad use of tariffs is being challenged in federal court, with a key case heading to oral arguments in an appeals court. The lawsuit argues that Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose duties on various countries by declaring a national emergency. A lower court previously struck down the tariffs, but the ruling was paused pending appeal. The outcome of this and other similar lawsuits could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs enacted by the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded projects. The move is seen as an effort by India to counteract China's growing influence in the strategically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England faces uncertainty over whether captain Ben Stokes will be able to bowl on the final day of the fourth Test against India. Stokes, who has a history of injuries, appeared "stiff and sore" and did not bowl on day four after scoring a century and taking five wickets earlier in the match. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick said the team will assess his condition overnight, but his potential absence is a concern for England's victory push. The all-rounder's heavy workload this series has renewed questions about how to best manage his fitness long-term.</p>
