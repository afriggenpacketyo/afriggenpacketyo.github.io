          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:45:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's Defense Ministry claims to have downed at least 126 Ukrainian drones in a large-scale overnight attack across 11 regions and annexed Crimea, with some intercepted near Moscow. The barrage led to temporary flight restrictions at several major airports and caused casualties, including three deaths in the Belgorod region and several injuries elsewhere. This escalation in drone warfare by both sides comes amid stalled ceasefire talks, with Ukraine also reporting a significant increase in Russian drone and missile strikes throughout July. The article details the rising frequency and scale of these attacks from both nations.</p>

          <h2>Release of Epstein Investigation Files Unlikely Due to DOJ Policy and Political Factors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite public and political pressure to release the "Epstein Files," their disclosure is highly improbable due to a long-standing Department of Justice policy against publicizing closed investigative files. This policy aims to protect uncharged individuals from public condemnation, though Attorney General Pam Bondi had previously suggested a release was imminent. An analysis by former prosecutor Elie Honig suggests that Bondi's reversal and the FBI's conclusion that there is "nothing to see here" may be influenced by political interests, including potential embarrassment for figures like Donald Trump. The article concludes that a full, transparent release of the investigation's findings is not expected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate narrowly passed a $9 billion budget rescission targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting, sending the bill back to the House for a final vote. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is dealing with continued criticism from supporters, like Michael Flynn, over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, which the president has dismissed as a "hoax." In other news, President Trump announced an end to federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, calling it a "scam." Despite the controversies, Trump affirmed his "total" confidence in Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel.</p>

          <p>A professional women's golf tournament in northern Japan was forced to cancel its opening day after a bear was spotted near the course. This marks the second time in two months that a JLPGA Tour event has been disrupted by a bear, highlighting a growing issue of human-bear encounters in the country. Last year, Japan saw a record number of bear attacks on humans, a trend attributed to factors like climate change impacting food sources and shrinking rural populations allowing bears to expand their habitat. In response, the Japanese government has approved measures allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas.</p>

          <p>Hosting the ESPY Awards, comedian Shane Gillis delivered a provocative opening monologue that drew mixed reactions for its sharp, roast-style humor. His jokes targeted numerous figures, including a controversial remark about Bill Belichick's younger girlfriend and a jab at Donald Trump's call for a UFC fight at the White House, which he linked to the January 6th Capitol attack. Gillis also referenced the political controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files and made a divisive joke about WNBA star Caitlin Clark. The edgy performance, which also included a nod to Norm Macdonald's famous O.J. Simpson bit, has sparked debate over its appropriateness for the event.</p>

While the overall decline has slowed compared to previous years, the persistently low birth rate, which is well below the 2.1 replacement level, puts pressure on the nation's economic sustainability, pension systems, and healthcare infrastructure.

          <p>The second Trump administration appears to be deprioritizing the prosecution of white-collar and corporate crimes, a shift that benefits corporate allies but raises concerns about accountability. Since taking office, Trump has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and his DOJ has retreated from cases involving money laundering and foreign corruption, with federal prosecutions down over 10% from last year. A DOJ memo in May emphasized minimizing burdens on businesses, suggesting a less aggressive enforcement approach. This contrasts with the administration's tough stance on crimes associated with immigration or political opponents, indicating a selective application of justice.</p>

These cooling economic indicators have led analysts to predict that the Bank of England is more likely to cut interest rates at its next meeting.

The author argues that Trump is less susceptible to domestic political pressure from pro-Israel groups than other presidents and is primarily driven by self-interest and a desire for accolades like a Nobel Peace Prize. While Trump has largely supported Israel's war, his transactional nature, dislike for large foreign expenditures, and fragile ego could be exploited.

          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is reviewed as a superb and bitterly funny modern western that satirizes contemporary American society. Set in a small New Mexico town during the early COVID-19 pandemic, the movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as a troubled sheriff and Pedro Pascal as the town's mayor, embodying the deep political and social divisions of the era. The review praises the film's sharp script, which captures the paranoia, misinformation, and social media-fueled brain sickness that defined the period. While described as bleak and at times overwhelming, "Eddington" is ultimately seen as a hysterical, self-aware critique of our times.</p>

The bill, AB 727, is championed by the mother of a trans teen who died by suicide and aims to provide a vital resource for queer youth. This legislative push comes as the federal government has cut funding for LGBTQ+ counselors through the national 9-8-8 crisis lifeline.

          <p>U.S. Senators from California are urging the Trump administration to reverse significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service, warning that they endanger lives and harm the state's economy. A letter from the senators highlights that two of California's six NWS offices, which cover the fire-prone Central Valley and Sierra Nevada, are among the hardest-hit in the nation. These offices are now too understaffed to operate 24/7, which could compromise critical fire weather forecasting and warnings for millions of people. The cuts are also expected to negatively impact California's $50-billion agriculture industry, which relies on NWS data.</p>

          <p>A columnist reflects on the legacy of Glenn Spencer, a once-prominent but now largely forgotten anti-immigration activist, arguing he was a key architect of the xenophobic rhetoric now central to Donald Trump's political platform. Spencer, who founded the website American Patrol in the 1990s, mainstreamed the "Reconquista" conspiracy theory and used vitriolic language to depict Latinos as an invading force. The author, who covered Spencer for years, notes that while Spencer was once seen as a fringe figure, his extremist views have now become federal policy and mainstream conservative talking points.

          <p>An opinion article argues that California must step up to support the electric vehicle (EV) industry following the Trump administration's decision to end most federal support for EV manufacturing. The author claims this federal shift hobbles the U.S. auto industry's ability to compete with China, which dominates the global EV market. To fill the void, the article proposes that California should implement its own consumer credits, fund the installation of chargers in multifamily housing, and streamline the permitting process for new fast-charging stations.

The 1910 law, which prohibits transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution, is described as an archaic and overly broad statute with a racist and xenophobic history. The author contends that using this law to secure a conviction when jurors acquitted Combs on more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges sets a dangerous precedent. It allows prosecutors to selectively enforce "dead letter" laws, which could be used discriminatorily.</p>

A recent study detailed how the fruit builds up internal fluid pressure, and upon the slightest touch, bursts open to launch its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour and distances of nearly 40 feet. Scientists used micro-CT scans and high-speed video to analyze the process, noting the fruit orients itself at a perfect ballistic angle for maximum distance. The seeds are also coated in an incredibly strong adhesive, suggesting applications in material science.</p>
