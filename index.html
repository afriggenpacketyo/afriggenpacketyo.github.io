            <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) is cracking down on the testing and marketing of EV self-driving technology after a fatal accident involving a Xiaomi EV. The MIIT convened a conference urging companies to comply with regulations and avoid overstating the capabilities of driver-assistance systems. This move comes after loose regulation led to risky testing of navigation-on-autopilot systems. Carmakers and tech firms are now barred from mass testing self-driving technologies or conducting over-the-air software updates without approval.</p>

            <p>The owner of Toby Carvery has issued an apology after the company felled a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, despite previous planning documents recognizing its significance. The company initially claimed the tree was dead and posed a safety risk, but later admitted to needing tighter protocols for handling such situations. Enfield Council has reported the incident as criminal damage, though police have closed the inquiry, deeming it a civil matter. The tree, listed on the Woodland Trust's ancient tree inventory, was felled on April 3rd, sparking public outrage and calls for better tree protection laws.</p>

            <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that President Trump's tariff-heavy trade agenda could lead to corruption and self-dealing within the administration. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, they requested details on plans to prevent misuse of tariffs for personal enrichment. The lawmakers believe the tariff rollout is "rife with opportunities to unduly influence President Trump and other administration officials." Led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Judy Chu and Linda SÃ¡nchez, the effort highlights Democratic scrutiny of Trump's economic policies.</p>

The juvenile squid was about 11 inches long, much smaller than the full-grown adults that can weigh up to 1,100 pounds.

            <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has stated that the NHS will be pursued if it does not update its guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling. The ruling defined a woman as biologically female under equalities law, impacting spaces like hospital wards and changing rooms. The EHRC is working to provide updated codes of conduct for services, including the NHS and prisons. Baroness Falkner, chairwoman of the EHRC, affirmed that the NHS will be challenged if it fails to comply with the new guidance.</p>

            <p>A government memo shows the Trump administration established broad rules for holding migrants at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there, despite promises to hold only "the worst" offenders. The memo outlines that migrants with final deportation orders who have a "nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity" can be detained at the base. This definition is broad, potentially including those who paid smugglers to enter the U.S. The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo appear at odds with statements suggesting the base would hold dangerous criminals.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico is facing widespread power outages affecting 1.4 million customers, including the main international airport, hospitals, and hotels, just before Easter. The outage has also left 328,000 without water. Crews are working to restore power, aiming to reach 90% of customers within 48 hours. This marks the second island-wide blackout in less than four months, prompting renewed calls for the government to cancel contracts with Luma Energy and Genera PR.

The Wine Institute stated that the tariffs would hurt the broader wine sector, including farmers, vintners, and retailers.
