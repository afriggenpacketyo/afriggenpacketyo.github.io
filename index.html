          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results with a 3.6% decline in U.S. same-store sales, the largest domestic drop since the pandemic's onset, attributed to bad weather and cautious consumer spending, especially among low- and middle-income groups. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that economic pressure has broadened, impacting restaurant traffic across income cohorts. Despite the challenges, McDonald's plans to lean into value meals and popular menu items to attract diners, with early success seen from new McCrispy Chicken Strips and Minecraft tie-in meals. The company maintains its full-year outlook, planning to open 2,200 locations and invest $3 billion to $3.2 billion in capital expenditures (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board asserts that President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have inflicted significant damage on American democracy, as he attempts to create a presidency unbound by Congress or the courts. The board expresses concern over Trump's autocratic approach, which could fundamentally alter the character of American government and encourage future presidents to similarly abuse their powers. The editorial calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimate election and the legality of some of his policies. It emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between unwise actions and undemocratic ones to focus opposition effectively, citing the successful campaign against repealing Obamacare as a case study.</p>

          <p>India's National Human Rights Commission is investigating reports that over 100 children fell ill after eating a school lunch in Bihar, where a dead snake was allegedly found in the food.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, refusing to return the money. Arrests are part of Governor Abbottâ€™s Operation Lone Star, aimed at curbing unauthorized border crossings. County officials defend their actions, stating their goal is to deter illegal crossings and that migrants accepted responsibility for attending court. However, critics argue that deporting migrants before their court dates and then forfeiting their bail is unjust, especially since some families sold belongings and took out loans to pay the bail. Some judges were uncomfortable with the practice, but the county attorney maintains that those who cross the border illegally assume the risk of deportation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly relying on local law enforcement to assist with mass deportations, with a six-day immigration sweep in Florida resulting in over 1,100 arrests. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers collaborated with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the state's Department of Corrections. These agreements are part of the 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials on immigration enforcement. Critics warn that this expansion could strain local resources and lead to civil rights violations, while supporters argue it frees up ICE officers for other key deportation tasks.</p>

          <p>Saving money in an inflationary economy can be challenging, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a solution with higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs allow you to lock in high rates for the term, and they come with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Strategies for getting a good CD rate include looking at online banks, considering short-term CDs, and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve. The best CD for your savings depends on comparing top rates and term lengths to maximize your balance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>CVS Health will significantly expand access to Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy for patients covered by its pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark, starting July 1. Caremark will prioritize Wegovy on its formularies, making it the preferred GLP-1 drug for obesity, and will drop Zepbound from its standard formularies. The PBM negotiated a lower net price for Wegovy, making it more affordable for members. CVS is also partnering with Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare, to dispense Wegovy at a lower price to cash-paying patients.</p>

          <p>Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm refuted a report claiming the board is looking to replace CEO Elon Musk, stating it is "absolutely false." The denial follows a Wall Street Journal report suggesting board members contacted recruitment firms and told Musk to dedicate more time to Tesla. Denholm affirmed the board's confidence in Musk's ability to execute the company's growth plan. The report came after Tesla's sales and profit were impacted by consumer backlash over Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) has lowered its 2025 financial guidance, citing an expected $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs. The revised guidance accounts for some tariff adjustments, including reimbursements for U.S. parts. GM also expects to spend $500 million in the second quarter to fix recalled SUVs and trucks. CEO Mary Barra said the company is working to mitigate the increased costs and strengthen its supply base.</p>
