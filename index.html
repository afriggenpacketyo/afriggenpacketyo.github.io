          <p>Sonny Curtis, the acclaimed songwriter and musician, shares insights from his extensive career, which began as a teenage bandmate of rock 'n' roll pioneer Buddy Holly. Curtis discusses his early life in West Texas, the formation of rock 'n' roll, and his friendship with Holly. Despite feeling left behind when Holly's band, The Crickets, found fame, he later joined the group and penned iconic songs like "I Fought the Law." His most enduring legacy may be the theme song for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Love Is All Around," which he wrote and sang.</p>

Finebaum stated he was arranging to interview Trump at the White House ahead of a major LSU vs. Alabama football game, an opportunity he described as being about the game, not politics. He expressed his devastation when network executives "killed it," citing a policy against mixing sports and politics, a rationale he found inconsistent with past network practices like interviews with President Obama.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have confirmed that the individual who attacked a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas was acting alone and specifically targeting ICE agents. The shooter, Joshua Jahn, used a legally purchased rifle from a nearby rooftop, resulting in the death of one detainee and critically injuring two others who were inside a transport van. Notes found at Jahn's residence revealed a clear animus towards ICE and indicated that he had been planning the attack for some time, using apps designed to track the locations of ICE personnel.</p>

          <p>New details reveal the suspect in the fatal Michigan church shooting, 40-year-old Marine veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, was motivated by anti-Mormon beliefs. A White House spokesperson stated the FBI director confirmed Sanford "hated people of the Mormon faith." Sanford drove his vehicle into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints building, opened fire with an assault rifle, and started a fire, killing four people before being fatally shot by police. A local political candidate who met Sanford reported he held a particular dislike for the church stemming from a past relationship.</p>

From October 6 to November 2, customers can collect game pieces from select purchases to win instant prizes, including free food, or collect property sets for larger rewards like a $1 million cash prize or a 2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The return of the game follows a major fraud scheme that was uncovered in the early 2000s, which previously led to the promotion's suspension.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the 33-year-old founder of the college financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Javice was found guilty of fabricating millions of customer accounts to inflate her company's value, which induced the bank to acquire Frank for $175 million in 2021. After the acquisition, JPMorgan discovered the firm had fewer than 300,000 real users, not the five million claimed. In court, Javice expressed profound remorse for her actions, but the judge emphasized the need for deterrence.</p>

The features allow parents to link their accounts with their teen's, enabling them to set usage time limits, disable voice mode, and prevent chat history from being used for model training. The system will also notify parents if it detects potential signs of self-harm. This move follows a lawsuit from a family alleging the chatbot encouraged their son's suicide, and comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny over AI's impact on minors.</p>

          <p>At a White House press conference, President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled a joint proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. Trump stated that if Hamas agrees to the plan, the war would end immediately, and urged the Palestinian group to accept the terms. Netanyahu affirmed his support for the plan but issued a stark warning that if Hamas rejects it, Israel has the full backing of the U.S. to "finish the job by itself." The proposal's first step would involve a hostage release within 72 hours.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has launched a new year-round line of protein-fortified lattes and cold foam drinks in the U.S. and Canada, a move aimed at revitalizing its sales. Analysts see the initiative as a significant catalyst, potentially adding up to 2.5 percentage points to U.S. same-store sales by tapping into the growing consumer trend for protein-rich options. This launch is the first major product rollout under CEO Brian Niccol's new stage-gate testing process, designed to ensure new items resonate with customers before a wide release, hopefully avoiding the mixed results of past beverage experiments.

          <p>The musician Cat Stevens, also known as Yusuf, has announced the postponement of his upcoming North American book tour, which was scheduled to begin in October.

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland. State officials argue there is no legal justification for the federal intervention and warn it will only escalate tensions in the city. The move comes after President Trump claimed, without evidence, that the city is "war ravaged" and federal facilities are under attack. This action represents the latest development in the administration's strategy of sending federal forces into Democratic-run cities, following similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan is experiencing a total internet and telecommunications blackout after the Taliban government ordered a nationwide shutdown of the country's fiber optic network. The move, which is disrupting everything from banking to media, is described by the authorities as a measure to prevent "immorality" and "vice." The shutdown follows weeks of regional internet restrictions in several provinces. Internet watchdog NetBlocks confirmed the "comprehensive, total blackout," noting that because telephone services are routed through the same network, they are also severely impacted across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective way to manage stress is not through inward-focused self-care but by channeling stress energy outward to help others. This approach, termed "stress springboarding," leverages the hormone oxytocin, which is released during stress and motivates social connection. Research indicates that workplace wellness programs encouraging volunteer work are uniquely successful. By focusing on contributing to one's community, family, or colleagues, individuals can activate reward centers in the brain and reduce activity in stress-related regions, effectively rewiring their response to pressure.</p>

During the event, McIlroy directly confronted hecklers and endured disruptions, including an incident where a cup of beer reportedly hit his wife's hat.

Originating from shepherds' songs, the music's modern form often features artists trading insults in their lyrics, which can escalate into real-world conflict and revenge killings. The violence has become so severe that the Lesotho government has banned some famo groups, labeling them as terrorists. The conflict, likened to 1990s U.S. hip-hop rivalries, has also infiltrated politics and spilled over into neighboring South Africa among migrant miners.</p>
