          <p>Russia conducted a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine, launching approximately 300 drones and 30 missiles. The assault resulted in one fatality in the port city of Odesa and caused damage to critical infrastructure in Sumy, leading to power outages. While Ukraine reported the scale of the attack, Russia claimed its air defenses successfully intercepted over 100 drones across its territory, including some targeting Moscow. Meanwhile, Australia announced it is delivering 49 Abrams tanks to support Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>An outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease Chikungunya has been confirmed in the southern Chinese city of Foshan, with over 1,100 cases reported in the Shunde district alone. The outbreak, which originated from an imported case in early July, has prompted local authorities to call for widespread sanitation and clean-up efforts to control the mosquito population. So far, all reported cases have presented with mild symptoms, and patients are being treated as the city works to contain the spread of the virus.</p>

          <p>As he promotes the sequel "Happy Gilmore 2," actor Adam Sandler revealed the fundamental advice he has given his two teenage daughters as they begin their own acting careers. He emphasized the importance of being kind and respectful to everyone on set, particularly the crew, stating, "The crew is all you got." His co-star Julie Bowen praised his parenting, and Sandler humorously added that while kindness is for everyone, you can "give a snap" to those making "too much cash."</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's long and complex relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and the subsequent evolution of Epstein-related conspiracy theories within the right-wing political sphere. It details how these theories became central to the MAGA movement, casting Trump as a savior fighting a cabal of pedophiles. Now, Trump faces a "conspiracy theory gap" as his own administration's findings debunked the existence of a "client list," causing friction with a base he cultivated on such narratives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing evidence that its widespread tariffs are contributing to rising consumer prices, a reality the president has publicly denied. As inflation ticks upward, President Trump has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, blaming him for not cutting interest rates to offset the economic impact. Economists note that tariffs are effectively a tax on importers and consumers, and the Fed is cautiously waiting to see their full effect on inflation before adjusting its policy.

The law specifies that a patient's death does not need to be "imminent" to justify an abortion and confirms doctors can discuss the procedure as a treatment option. However, reproductive rights advocates and some physicians remain skeptical, arguing the law doesn't go far enough and that the severe penalties for violations will continue to cause delays in life-saving care.</p>

          <p>Jemima Goldsmith, former wife of imprisoned ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan, has accused Pakistan's government of threatening to arrest their two sons if they visit the country. The warning comes as Khan's PTI party plans nationwide protests to demand his release, and an advisor to the current prime minister stated the sons would be "dealt with accordingly" if they break the law. The sons, who live in the UK, have recently made rare public appearances to advocate for their father, sparking debate about their potential role in Pakistani politics.</p>

          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded, with women now having an average of 1.18 babies. This decline is causing towns like Fregona in northern Italy to shrink, threatening the viability of local services like primary schools. Despite government incentives, many Italians find it difficult to start families due to a lack of affordable childcare and economic uncertainty, raising concerns about the nation's future social and economic stability.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China next week. His testimony will focus on countering what the committee calls China's "economic coercion against democracies." This refers to the period during his leadership when China imposed tariffs on Australian goods after his government called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19. The hearing comes as the current Australian government is actively working to warm diplomatic and trade relations with Beijing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed into law the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation is a significant victory for the crypto industry, aiming to legitimize the use of stablecoins for payments and reinforce the dollar's global status. While supporters praise the move, critics argue the law lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections and could make the U.S. financial system vulnerable to exploitation.

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, may inadvertently speed up the spread of cancer to other organs. The research suggests that chemotherapy can "awaken" dormant cancer cells, promoting metastasis, which could explain why some breast cancer patients experience recurrence despite successful initial treatment. The team also identified drugs that could potentially inhibit this process in mice, and a clinical trial for breast cancer patients is now underway.</p>

The legal action comes as the Trump administration, facing pressure from its own base, has moved to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Epstein case to increase transparency.</p>

The move is expected to impact hundreds of scientists and researchers and will result in savings of nearly $750 million, according to the agency. Critics and former EPA officials condemned the decision, stating it dismantles a world-renowned research organization and leaves the public more vulnerable to pollution and environmental health risks.</p>
