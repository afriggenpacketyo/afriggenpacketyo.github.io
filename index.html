          <p>The U.S. government has deported eight men, originally from various Asian and Latin American countries, to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle. None of the men are citizens of South Sudan, a country the State Department warns Americans against visiting due to conflict and instability. The deportees had been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. and served their sentences. Human rights advocates condemned the action as punitive and unconstitutional, expressing fears that the men could face torture or other harm.</p>

          <p>Retired Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce received significant criticism for a social media post celebrating the Fourth of July. In his post, he praised the holiday as a day for Americans to set aside differences, but many commenters labeled it as "tone-deaf" and "out of touch." The backlash appeared to be linked to the recent signing of a controversial spending bill by President Trump, with users pointing to ongoing political divisions and suffering in the country.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 20 individuals at a demonstration in Westminster for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison, followed an incident where the group claimed responsibility for causing millions in damage to military aircraft. The arrested individuals were held on suspicion of offenses under the Terrorism Act 2000 after gathering with signs supporting the group.</p>

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options is causing widespread confusion and frustration, a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation." While tipping norms were once clear, customers now face prompts in unexpected places, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks. Experts note that these systems often default to suggesting tips of 15-25%, pressuring consumers into tipping more frequently and generously. This shift, accelerated during the pandemic, benefits not only employees but also the tech companies that process the transactions.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for Reform UK, has voluntarily given up the party whip pending an investigation into allegations regarding his business activities. The allegations, published by the Sunday Times, concern the propriety of government-backed Bounce Back loans totaling £70,000 that his companies received during the Covid-19 pandemic. McMurdock maintains his business dealings were lawful and compliant, but requested the temporary suspension to protect the party during the internal investigation.

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gained popularity on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The drink typically combines coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium powder, and salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients, alone or in combination, can directly reduce cortisol levels. While the beverage is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors note that managing stress effectively relies on proven methods like adequate sleep, exercise, and social connection.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has risen to at least 16, with rescue operations ongoing. The building collapsed on Friday, and rescuers have been working with heavy machinery to search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped in the rubble. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards and a lack of regulation enforcement often lead to structurally unsound buildings. The narrow street where the building was located has hampered the rescue efforts.</p>

          <h2>Physician Describes How New Medicaid Work Requirements Will Harm Vulnerable Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:38:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A doctor working at a public hospital argues that new work requirements for Medicaid will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable patients, even those who should be exempt. The article explains that for individuals facing homelessness, disability, language barriers, or lack of internet access, the bureaucratic burden of proving employment or exemption status is often insurmountable. Citing the case of Arkansas, where similar rules caused thousands of eligible people to lose coverage, the author contends the policy is designed to cut costs by making access to care too difficult, rather than targeting fraud.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to manage negative emotions like anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering feeling is due to consciously or unconsciously re-running the thought. By allowing oneself to feel the emotion for that short time and then choosing to shift focus, individuals can prevent rumination and recover more quickly from life's upsets.</p>

          <p>A shop owner in Durham, UK, who personally stopped a man from stealing a crate of beer, expressed frustration with the lack of legal consequences for the offender. After the shopkeeper, Andrew Board, brought the thief back to his store, police dealt with the matter through a "community resolution" instead of court action. The offender simply had to pay for the stolen goods and was banned from the shop. Board argues this sends the wrong signal, as it provides no real deterrent for shoplifters, reflecting a broader national issue where most reported thefts do not result in charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inspired by the central role of hobbies in Danish culture, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies in one year. She found that engaging in activities like tennis, woodworking, and mahjong fundamentally changed her life by reducing doomscrolling, fostering community, and deepening her relationships. The experience helped her feel less lonely and more confident, leading her to conclude that actively pursuing hobbies is a key secret to achieving better work-life balance and overall happiness, rather than waiting for balance to appear on its own.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's sex-trafficking trial highlights the legal system's failure to adequately address intimate partner violence and coercive control. The author suggests that prosecutors resorted to trafficking charges because existing domestic violence laws are often ill-equipped to handle cases involving wealthy, powerful abusers. The piece criticizes media portrayals that soften the image of predators and notes that despite the verdict, Combs was not fully acquitted. It ultimately presents the outcome as a demonstration of systemic flaws rather than true justice for survivors.</p>

          <p>Florida was the most popular state for retirees to move to in 2023, attracting a net influx of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older, according to a new analysis of Census Bureau data. The state's appeal is often attributed to its sunny weather and tax-friendly policies, including no state income, estate, or inheritance tax. Following Florida in popularity were North Carolina and Delaware. In contrast, California experienced the largest net loss of retirees, with nearly 57,000 more people in that age group leaving the state than moving in. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks have plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. since 1970, a major public health achievement. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including the significant decline in smoking rates, the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and better emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, often in more chronic forms, the risk of an acute heart attack being fatal has been drastically reduced, saving tens of millions of lives over the past five decades.</p>
