          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has suggested that the recent Blue Origin space flight, which featured an all-female crew including Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos' fiancÃ©e Lauren Sanchez, may have been faked using green screen technology. O'Neal pointed to discrepancies in a video released by Blue Origin, such as the luxurious and unmoved hair of the crew members in space, and a key that appeared to open the landing capsule before Bezos used it. Blue Origin has not yet responded to requests for comment on O'Neal's theory. The mission lasted 10 minutes and 21 seconds, with Perry describing the experience as second only to being a mom.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA may not be fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, despite Acting Administrator David Richardson's assertion that the agency is 80-85% ready. The review cites staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and a lack of coordination with states as potential issues. Richardson stated that the agency's intent for the 2025 disaster season is to safeguard the American people, return primacy to the states, and coordinate federal assistance when necessary, while transforming to the future of FEMA. Richardson also warned staff against undermining his efforts to achieve the president's objectives.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who used his commencement speech to condemn the Gaza war and accuse the U.S. of supporting 'genocide'.

NYU accused Rozos of abusing a privilege to express personal political views and said it 'strongly denounces' his remarks, while pursuing disciplinary action.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are threatening to strike due to stalled contract negotiations, primarily over pay raises, potentially impacting over 300,000 commuters. The union, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), claims they haven't had a raise in five years, while NJ Transit says their last offer was competitive. Governor Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike occurs, and NJ Transit has a contingency plan to accommodate only 20% of daily riders, urging people to work from home if possible.

          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 600 employees, including many journalists, at Voice of America, a federally funded news network providing independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. These layoffs, amounting to over a third of the staff, signal a continuation of efforts to dismantle the broadcaster, which Trump has called 'the voice of radical America.' The federal building housing the media organization has also been put up for sale. Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, described the firings as 'inexplicable' and has sued to stop the dismantling of the news organization.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deals to sell advanced chips and AI technology to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have ignited internal debate about outsourcing the future of the AI industry. While some officials believe these deals will boost American AI companies and widen the nation's lead, others fear inadequate protections could allow the technology to benefit China. Concerns also exist that the world's biggest data centers may end up in the Middle East instead of the United States.

          <p>Republicans are advancing a 'megabill' to enact President Trump's agenda, proposing roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts, primarily benefiting the wealthy, while increasing military and immigration enforcement spending. To offset these costs, the bill would slash funding for health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Key points of contention include the state and local tax deduction, Medicaid cuts, and clean energy program reductions. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured while reducing federal healthcare spending by over $700 billion.</p>

Comey removed the post, stating he was unaware of the potential meaning and opposes violence of any kind.

The audit was prompted by the death of George Floyd and reviewed cases during Dr. David R. Fowlerâ€™s tenure as chief medical examiner.

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement, made at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, lacked specifics, leaving Treasury officials scrambling to understand which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. The Syrian transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, citing its inability to pay civil service salaries and rebuild the war-torn country. Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The contraction was more significant than economists had anticipated, with uncertainties stemming from President Trump's trade policies affecting Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had previously warned of a potential moderation in the economy due to these trade policies. Despite growth concerns, the central bank may continue raising its policy rate if inflation remains above its 2% target.</p>

          <p>Top US diplomat Marco Rubio stated that he does not expect a breakthrough in the upcoming Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Turkey, asserting that progress requires a direct meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump echoed this sentiment, suggesting that nothing significant would happen until he and Putin meet in person. Ukraine has confirmed it will send a delegation to the talks, but criticized the low-level representation from Moscow. Putin proposed direct talks on May 15 in Istanbul in response to a call by European leaders and Ukraine for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are experiencing financial instability due to President Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Chinese goods. Business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, has faced both high tariffs and subsequent reductions, leading to price increases and shipping challenges. The situation has left many U.S. businesses unsure whether to ship goods at the current 30% tariff rate or wait for further reductions. Some companies are utilizing foreign trade zones and bonded warehouses to defer tariff payments, but many are struggling to maintain profitability amidst the uncertainty.</p>

The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on whether to limit this power, particularly in cases involving President Trumpâ€™s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship. The author argues that limiting the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions would weaken the judiciary's ability to check illegal presidential actions, especially given Trump's record of issuing potentially illegal executive orders.</p>
