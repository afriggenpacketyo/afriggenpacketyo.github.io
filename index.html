          <p>Adolfo "Fito" Macias, the notorious leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, has been extradited from Ecuador to the United States. This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its citizens to a foreign country. Macias faces charges in New York for cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and firearms violations, following his recapture in June after a high-profile prison escape in January. His extradition is a significant moment in Ecuador's struggle against powerful drug cartels that have turned the nation into a key hub for global cocaine trafficking.</p>

          <p>Former Nickelodeon star Drake Bell has publicly claimed that the network does not pay residuals to its child actors for shows that continue to air. In a recent podcast appearance, Bell stated that despite the ongoing popularity and syndication of his show "Drake & Josh," he and his co-stars do not receive continued compensation. He described this practice as exploitative, contrasting the network's significant profits with the financial struggles of its former stars. This allegation adds to previous claims Bell made about experiencing sexual assault while working at the network.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast is emerging between the United States and China regarding their approaches to energy and climate policy. As global demand for electricity rises, driven by new technologies like artificial intelligence, China is accelerating its investment in renewable energy to secure a technological lead. In contrast, the Trump administration is reportedly moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar energy, labeling them as unreliable. This divergence highlights a key area of competition in the ongoing tensions between the two global powers.</p>

The Commanders dropped their previous name in 2020 following years of criticism that it was a racial slur against Indigenous people, and it remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the stadium project.</p>

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, placing it among the top 10 affected countries globally. The province of Alberta has the highest per capita spread in North America, raising questions about why the virus is spreading more rapidly there than in the U.S. Health authorities link the surge to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Mennonite communities, and a rise in vaccine hesitancy fueled by misinformation following the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts stress that increasing immunization is the only effective way to contain the highly contagious virus.</p>

The article argues that strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, are setting a positive tone for the current season.

Other positive factors include tax relief for businesses, reshoring of manufacturing, and massive investment in data centers and the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

This savings gap is projected to leave those retiring in 2050 with £800 less per year.

The poll highlights a growing divide between Trump's political base and the rest of the country on issues like immigration and the economy. Most Americans, including a declining number of Hispanic Americans, disapprove of the program's implementation and want the administration to focus more on lowering prices.

This, combined with the complexities of building on a "small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island," led to massive expenses from compensating landowners and altering plans through a complex parliamentary bill process, fundamentally undermining the project's viability from the start.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods' career. In the last four seasons, Scheffler has won four major championships and demonstrated a machine-like consistency that draws direct comparisons to Woods. While his swing may appear unorthodox, his mental fortitude and ruthless ability to close out tournaments set him apart from his peers. Recent improvements to his putting have transformed him from a top-tier player into an undisputed world number one.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is closing the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD), the scientific arm responsible for providing the data behind environmental regulations. The move is part of a broader plan to reduce the EPA's staff by 23%. The EPA states this will allow it to better focus on its core mission and be responsible with taxpayer money, while creating a new "Office of Applied Science and Environmental solutions." Critics, however, argue that eliminating the ORD will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health and safety.</p>

          <p>According to Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, American companies operating in China are navigating a difficult environment defined by trade tensions. In an interview, Stein noted that while an extension of the current 90-day tariff pause is likely, the focus of discussions has been almost exclusively on tariffs, neglecting other critical issues. He expressed the business community's concern that this narrow focus fails to address the broader complexities of the economic relationship. Stein also suggested a path toward de-escalation could involve reciprocal tariff reductions following China's recent actions on fentanyl precursors. (not investment advice)</p>

By financing projects with a mix of equity and conventional loans, Better Angels plans to build housing faster and at a fraction of the typical cost.

The deals would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for life sentences, potentially bringing closure to the nearly 25-year-old case. According to legal experts, the cancellation will likely trigger more litigation and years of additional pretrial hearings, pushing a final verdict even further into the future.

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died on Long Island, New York, after his heavy metal necklace caused him to be violently pulled into a running MRI machine. The man had reportedly entered the MRI room without permission to assist his wife, who had just completed a scan. The powerful magnetic field of the machine attracted the 20-pound chain he was wearing for weight training, resulting in a fatal "medical episode." The incident is under investigation and serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers posed by metallic objects near MRI equipment.</p>
