          <p>Five fishermen, including three Peruvians and two Colombians, arrived in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by an Ecuadorian tuna boat, having spent 55 days adrift at sea after their boat's alternator was damaged. The Ecuadorian navy coordinated with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. This rescue follows a similar incident earlier in the year when another Peruvian fisherman was rescued after 95 days at sea, highlighting the dangers faced by those working in the fishing industry and the importance of international cooperation in rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese delegations met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs in an attempt to de-escalate trade tensions that threaten the global economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in prolonged negotiations aimed at scaling back the massive tariffs both countries have imposed on each other's goods. President Trump suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have pushed for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where legally mandated. This effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon" metric, which quantifies the economic damage from global warming, including wildfires and droughts. Critics argue that this decision ignores the scientific consensus on climate change and allows for policies guided by "feelings, not facts." The American Petroleum Institute has supported limiting the application of the social cost of carbon, while environmental groups may challenge the administration's actions in court.</p>

The leaders warned that "new and massive" sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire.</p>

Trump has been urging the central bank to cut rates, but Powell has voiced confidence in a "solid" economy and dismissed pre-emptive cuts.

          <p>Despite a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, explosions were reported in the Kashmir region controlled by India. Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, reported the activation of air defense units in Srinagar. While Indian officials accused Pakistan of violating the truce, Pakistani officials denied any violations. President Trump claimed the agreement was the result of U.S.-brokered talks, although this was not confirmed by Pakistani or Indian leaders. The renewed tensions highlight the fragility of the ceasefire and the ongoing conflict between the two nations.</p>

Reports indicate that a significant portion of the country's provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties, raising concerns about governance and economic development. The 1987 constitution prohibits political dynasties, but this rule has never been enforced.</p>
