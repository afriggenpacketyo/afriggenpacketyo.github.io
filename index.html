          <p>President Trump is expected to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for not bringing criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Federal investigators reportedly found no clear evidence that James committed mortgage fraud when purchasing a home, but administration officials pushed for charges anyway. The move raises concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice, as the administration allegedly plans to install a new U.S. attorney who will more aggressively pursue Trump's political adversaries.</p>

          <p>The newly merged Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, with sources suggesting a potential offer price between $22 and $24 per share. This development comes as Warner Bros. Discovery announced plans to separate its global TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. The potential acquisition could preempt that split, creating a massive media conglomerate with a vast portfolio of networks, sports rights, and two major film studios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Republican-led resolution to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a "courageous American patriot" following his assassination is causing division among House Democrats. While Democratic leadership plans to vote for the measure, they are not pressuring members to do so, reflecting internal tensions over Kirk's controversial past statements. The debate highlights broader national concerns about political polarization and free speech, particularly after the FCC chairman pressured ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel for comments about the killing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 10:38:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a "B2B2C" business model to reduce the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. This strategy involves routing online sales through a middleman company, which acts as the merchant of record and pays tariffs on the product's lower wholesale price rather than its retail price. While this method, dubbed "tariff hacking," helps companies like Tod's Group and Yours Clothing avoid passing costs to consumers, some logistics experts warn it's a short-term solution that could face future regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats Josh Shapiro and Pete Buttigieg have responded to excerpts from Vice President Kamala Harris's forthcoming memoir, "107 Days." Shapiro stated Harris will "have to answer" for not publicly raising concerns about Joe Biden's fitness to campaign, a concern she details in the book. Buttigieg expressed surprise at Harris's claim that he was too much of a political risk as a gay man for the VP slot, stating voters care more about what politicians will do for them than their identity categories.</p>

It refutes the conservative claim that this is equivalent to the Biden administration's jawboning of social media firms over COVID misinformation, noting that Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr explicitly threatened regulatory action like fines and license revocations. The piece contends the administration's motive is to stifle political criticism, citing Trump's previous complaints about "bad stories" and the FCC's partisan investigations into news outlets.</p>

          <p>An advisory committee reshaped by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has postponed a vote on whether to change the long-standing recommendation for newborns to receive a hepatitis B vaccine. The panel was considering delaying the first dose from within 24 hours of birth to at least one month of age for most infants. The decision to delay the vote came after debate among members, with some vaccine critics questioning the shot's safety at birth, while other medical experts defended the current policy as a safe and critical public health intervention.</p>
