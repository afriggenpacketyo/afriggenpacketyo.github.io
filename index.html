          <p>Survivors and families of victims of the 2005 West Japan Railway Co. train derailment gathered to offer prayers and remember the 107 people who died and 562 who were injured in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture. JR West President Kazuaki Hasegawa pledged to keep the memories of the accident alive, especially since most of the company's employees joined after the tragedy. A facility is being built in Osaka Prefecture to preserve train cars and belongings of the victims, which will be open to families and transportation officials. The accident occurred when the train, traveling at 116 kph, derailed on a curve with a 70 kph speed limit.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration commended Paraguay's President Santiago Peña for designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. This move is considered a significant blow to Iran's terror network in the Western Hemisphere, particularly in the Tri-Border Area where Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil meet. The administration also highlighted Paraguay's expansion of its 2019 designations to include the entirety of Hezbollah and Hamas. The U.S. hopes this will cut off the Iranian regime's ability to fund terrorism and operate in Latin America.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Potential Crimea Proposal Signals Shift in US Policy</h2>

          <p>President Trump is considering a proposal that would recognize Russian control over Crimea, marking a significant shift from over a decade of U.S. policy. The Obama administration and Western allies rejected Russia's annexation of the territory in 2014. While Trump had previously hinted at considering the matter, his administration later pledged to maintain the nonrecognition policy until Ukraine's territorial integrity was restored. This proposal signals a potential departure from that stance in efforts to negotiate an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The attacks on Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are seen as more than just about his job security, but an attempt to undermine Trump's foreign policy agenda. Recent controversies, including leaked Signal chats and firings within the Pentagon, highlight divisions within the administration, particularly regarding Iran. Hegseth's detractors are viewed as expressing frustration that the president is not as aligned with their views on Iran.</p>
