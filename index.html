          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck central Texas, causing what officials describe as a "mass casualty event" with at least 48 fatalities confirmed. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and a children's summer camp, from which over two dozen campers remain missing. Hundreds of people have been rescued, some from treetops, as state and federal authorities mount a massive search and rescue operation. The rapid and unforeseen nature of the deluge has left the region in shock, facing a long and difficult recovery.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time for the murder of his wife, Suzanne, whose remains were discovered in 2023. The rearrest follows a new grand jury indictment, which reveals that a unique combination of tranquilizer drugs was found in her bone marrow. Authorities allege that Morphew, an avid hunter, was the only private citizen in the area with access to this compound, which he reportedly used for sedating deer. After initial charges were dropped in 2022, this new forensic evidence provides a direct link, leading to his new charge and a $3 million bond.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their opening game of the California Classic to the Golden State Warriors with a final score of 89-84. Despite building a double-digit lead in the first half, the Lakers' defense faltered in the third quarter, allowing the Warriors to take control. Cole Swider was a standout performer for the Lakers, scoring a game-high 24 points, while recent draft pick Dalton Knecht struggled with his shooting.

The article explores how Trump has used this tactic to push NATO allies to increase defense spending, but questions its effectiveness against entrenched adversaries like Russia and Iran.

As of Saturday evening, Chantal had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and was moving north. Forecasters anticipate some slight strengthening before it reaches the coast, after which it is expected to weaken rapidly as it moves inland.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid has secured a place in the Club World Cup semifinals against Paris Saint-Germain after a 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund. The Spanish club dominated most of the match, with goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García. A spectacular late volley from Kylian Mbappé sealed the win, though a subsequent red card for defender Dean Huijsen added late drama. The victory continues a strong start for new manager Xabi Alonso, whose team will now prepare for a high-profile showdown with Mbappé's former club.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are warning that recent cuts to HIV research funding by the Trump administration could jeopardize the nation's goal of eliminating the epidemic by 2030. While the administration's initiative to end HIV is still funded, broader grants for scientific research, particularly for prevention and a potential cure, have been slashed. Dr. John Brooks, a former CDC official, expressed concern that the focus has shifted too heavily toward treatment at the expense of prevention. He fears these cuts will reverse the significant progress made in recent years and could lead to an increase in new HIV infections.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially announced his resignation from Congress, further shrinking the GOP's already slim majority in the House. With Green's departure, effective July 20, the Republican majority will be reduced to 219-212. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving to start a private sector business aimed at helping the U.S. compete with China. His exit presents an additional challenge for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has struggled to unite his conference on key legislative issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is again attempting to curb China's influence in the global drone market, but industry experts suggest it may be a difficult task. A recent executive order targets Chinese-made drones, yet analysts note that China's firms are world leaders and deeply embedded in global supply chains. US-based drone operators express concern that banning these products could significantly raise costs and limit options, as there are few non-Chinese alternatives available. This highlights the economic and logistical challenges Washington faces in trying to decouple from China's established technological dominance in this sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing criticism for sending an email that critics call misleading and partisan. The email claimed that President Trump's new spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." However, the legislation does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, income-limited tax deduction for seniors. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have blasted the communication as a "lie" and "blatant misinformation," noting that the agency has historically remained apolitical in its public statements.

          <p>England's rugby team secured a convincing 35-12 victory over Argentina in their first Test match, thanks in large part to a stellar performance from George Ford on his 100th cap. After a tight first half, England dominated the second, with Tom Roebuck scoring two tries and Freddie Steward adding another. Ford expertly managed the game, kicking a crucial drop goal and several penalties to keep the Pumas at bay. Despite a brief comeback attempt from Argentina, England's clinical execution and strong defense ensured a comfortable win ahead of their second Test next week.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made his first public appearance since the 12-day conflict with Israel in June, according to Iranian state media. He was shown on television attending a religious ceremony in Tehran, ending speculation about his whereabouts after he had only appeared in pre-recorded messages during the war. The conflict involved a surprise Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, followed by Iranian retaliation. Khamenei's appearance comes as the country observes the religious mourning period of Muharram, and was heavily featured in state media coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy can negatively impact a developing baby. Researchers found that exposure to high heat, particularly in the first trimester or even before conception, was linked to infants being smaller in the womb. The effects were nearly doubled for mothers in "climate-vulnerable" neighborhoods, which are often hotter and have less access to air conditioning or filtration. Doctors are urging more attention to these climate-related risks for pregnant people, advising simple precautions like staying cool, hydrated, and wearing a mask during smoke events.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party," following a poll he conducted on his social media platform, X. The billionaire suggested the party could gain influence in Congress by targeting a small number of key House and Senate seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. The move comes after a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a major spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed. Musk, a major political donor, has positioned the new party as an alternative for voters who feel unrepresented by the two major parties.</p>
