The drone attacks signify a strategic shift in the conflict, enabling Ukraine to challenge Russia's military assets and extend its reach. The success of these attacks underscores the evolving nature of modern warfare and the increasing importance of drone technology in military operations.</p>

          <p>One of Big Bear's bald eaglets, Sunny, has taken its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow. The eaglet jumped off a branch and flew away, while its sibling, Gizmo, remained in the nest. Experts anticipate Sunny will return to the nest soon, as young eagles often do after their initial flight. Both eaglets, determined to be female, will remain in the area for one to three months before venturing out on their own, and they will likely be in and out of the nest during this time.</p>

Mia testified that Combs tormented and sexually assaulted her during her employment, while defense attorneys challenged her credibility by presenting affectionate text messages and social media posts she sent to Combs. Prosecutors sought to counter the defense's arguments by highlighting that Mia's social media posts were part of her job and did not reflect the abuse she allegedly endured.

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned two south Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline in 2020. The divers believed the fishing line was illegal and reported the incident to state wildlife officials. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, arguing the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase their felony convictions, restoring their rights to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the U.S.</p>
