          <h2>Trump Administration Modifies Car Tariffs Amid Industry Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 18:21:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order modifying tariffs on carmakers, addressing concerns that the levies would harm U.S. manufacturing. The changes exempt carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports from other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Carmakers can also qualify for tariff relief on imported components, phased out over two years. While automakers welcomed the relaxation, analysts noted the policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers. The changes are a sign that the administration's decision to impose stiff levies on nearly all trading partners has created chaos and economic uncertainty for American companies.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers have given final approval to a bill that would ban fluoride in public drinking water, a move opposed by dentists and public health advocates. Proponents argue that high fluoride levels could pose risks to children's intellectual development, while opponents cite its effectiveness in preventing cavities. The bill now goes to Governor Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against fluoridation. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava expressed disappointment, stating the decision disregards the consensus of medical experts and will harm vulnerable families. The CDC considers adding fluoride to drinking water one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.</p>

The proposal aims to address the root causes of skyrocketing college costs.

The proposal would replace existing income-contingent repayment arrangements with a single "repayment assistance plan."

          <h2>Harvard Task Force Releases Scathing Reports on Antisemitism and Anti-Muslim Bias</h2>

          <p>A Harvard task force released a report finding that antisemitism had infiltrated coursework, social life, and faculty hiring. A separate report found widespread discomfort and alienation among Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian students, with 92% believing they would face penalties for expressing their political opinions. Harvard is being scrutinized by the Trump administration over accusations of antisemitism, and is fighting the administration’s withdrawal of billions of dollars in federal funding. Harvard's president apologized for the problems revealed in the task force reports. The university recently adopted a contested definition of antisemitism, put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.</p>

The Los Angeles Lakers’ new guard made a $5,000 donation on Tuesday to cover the entire goal of a GoFundMe page created by artist Louie Palsino. After Kobe and Gigi Bryant died in a helicopter crash in January 2020, hundreds of murals and public art projects honoring them sprung up around Southern California. Dončić joined the Lakers less than three months ago in a blockbuster trade with the Dallas Mavericks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists working on a major report on climate change. The National Climate Assessment is a federal compendium of climate science focused on how climate change is affecting the US. The US government, state and local governments, private companies, and other entities rely on the report to make decisions around planning, infrastructure, conservation, and public health. The administration's energy strategy promotes fossil fuels and downplays climate change, which makes it inconvenient to have an in-house team of experts demonstrating the current and future harms of global warming.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval ratings remain low as he reaches his 100th day in office, with a majority of Americans disapproving of his performance. Consumer confidence is at its worst level since the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. These numbers also extend into specific issues. Immigration is historically one of Trump’s strongest issues, but the ABC/Post poll finds that more voters now disapprove of his handling than approve. An unpopular president is a less powerful president. Enacting an authoritarian approach is harder (though not impossible) without public support, and other institutions—the Republican Party, universities, law firms—are less likely to bend their knee if they see weakness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a cash bonus for having a baby, with a proposal for a $5,000 payment to mothers after giving birth. While countries around the world use baby bonuses to support new parents, the idea faces skepticism and debate in the US. Critics view it as a distraction from the administration’s broader agenda, including tariffs and cuts to social safety nets. A baby bonus would arrive immediately rather than forcing new parents to wait around until tax season for financial aid. The article reports that conservatives generally tend to favor expanding child tax credits (which reduce tax liability) over refundable credits or direct payments, and they tend to favor benefits tied to employment rather than welfare they allege could promote having children outside of marriage.</p>

For small food businesses, costs were already a concern due to persistently high inflation, and cocoa prices had been climbing even before the new tariffs were announced.

The agreement far surpasses a $2.6bn settlement reached in 2022 with the Boy Scouts of America. The plaintiffs were able to sue because of a California law that took effect in 2020 and suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault victims to bring cases for three years.
