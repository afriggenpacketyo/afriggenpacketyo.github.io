          <p>President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy held a meeting at the White House, joined by several European leaders, to discuss ending the war with Russia. Trump indicated the U.S. would provide Ukraine with security assistance, suggesting Europe would bear most of the burden but that America would be involved. In a shift from his previous stance, Trump stated that a ceasefire was not a necessary precondition for a peace deal, though European leaders present stressed its importance. The meeting, described as more cordial than their last encounter, also focused on arranging a trilateral summit between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Russian President Putin to facilitate a resolution.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, a woman known as the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges related to supplying the ketamine that caused actor Matthew Perry's death in 2023. This plea is part of a larger case involving five individuals, including two doctors and Perry's assistant, who are criminally charged in connection with his death. According to the plea agreement, Sangha supplied the drug to an accomplice who then provided it to Perry's assistant for administration. Sangha also admitted to maintaining a drug-involved premises since 2019 and selling ketamine that led to another individual's fatal overdose, facing a significant potential prison sentence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the disorienting societal effects of the generative AI boom, describing it as a "collective delusion" driven by tech industry hype. It highlights bizarre applications, like an AI-reanimated dead teenager, and the resulting public confusion and anxiety over job security and the nature of reality. The author questions whether the technology will ever deliver on its grandest promises, suggesting the real danger lies in society reorienting its economy, culture, and cognition around a tool that may only be "good enough." This could lead to widespread pollution and cognitive debt without the promised revolutionary benefits, a scenario described as a potential mass delusion.</p>

          <p>Former Attorney General Bill Barr provided over four hours of closed-door testimony to the House Oversight Committee regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, with lawmakers offering conflicting interpretations of his deposition. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that Barr was cooperative and shed light on the investigation, asserting that Barr saw no evidence implicating former President Trump. In contrast, Democratic representatives Jasmine Crockett and Suhas Subramanyam claimed the testimony left them with more questions and criticized the Republican line of questioning as performative. A source familiar with the deposition confirmed Barr told investigators Trump never gave instructions related to the Epstein case.</p>

The Invincibles' bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133 runs, with notable performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan, who took key early wickets. Sam Curran also contributed significantly with three wickets and a run-out. In their chase, despite an early setback, a strong partnership between Jordan Cox (56) and Sam Curran (50 not out) guided the Invincibles to victory with 11 balls remaining, solidifying their lead in the league standings.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds American Wages Continue to Lag Behind Inflation Since the Pandemic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 17:00:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Bankrate reveals that, on average, American wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past four years, falling short by 1.2 percentage points. This gap contributes to widespread economic dissatisfaction, with many households feeling their income is insufficient to cover the rising cost of living. The report highlights that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind, while workers in sectors like leisure and hospitality have seen wage growth outpace inflation due to post-pandemic demand. The findings align with other data showing low wage satisfaction and increased financial strain even among high-income households, signaling ongoing economic pressure for many Americans.</p>

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about significant and disruptive federal immigration enforcement actions that occurred over the weekend. These raids, which included detentions at a local car wash and outside a Home Depot, are described as part of a larger pattern of activity that has instilled fear and uncertainty in the community. One incident involved agents tackling and detaining a U.S. citizen who was later released. Local leaders have condemned the enforcement, stating it destabilizes families and the economy without enhancing public safety, and the city has joined a lawsuit challenging the federal actions.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar. The deal reportedly involves an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, followed by negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously stated he would only accept a deal releasing all hostages at once. The development comes as the Israeli military intensifies strikes in Gaza City, prompting further displacement and deepening the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) services have grown in popularity, but rising defaults have raised questions about debt relief options. As unsecured debts, BNPL balances are technically eligible for debt forgiveness programs, similar to credit card debt. However, eligibility can be inconsistent, as BNPL is a newer form of debt and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements with debt relief companies. This article suggests that borrowers struggling with BNPL debt should also consider other strategies, such as negotiating directly with the provider for a hardship plan, consolidating debts with a personal loan, or seeking guidance from a credit counseling service.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the Polari Prize, an award celebrating LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following significant controversy. The backlash began after author John Boyne was longlisted for his novel; Boyne had previously written an article defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues, where he compared women critical of Rowling to wives in 'The Handmaid's Tale' who help their husbands rape handmaidens. In protest of his nomination, several other longlisted authors withdrew their work, and over 800 publishing industry figures signed an open letter of criticism. The organizers decided to pause the prize to review their processes and increase trans representation.</p>

While Trump pledged that the U.S. would help guarantee Ukraine's security, he emphasized that European nations would need to carry most of the burden.

Trump's announcement, based on persistent false claims of widespread fraud, signals his intent to influence the 2026 midterm elections. However, legal experts and previous court rulings affirm that such sweeping changes to election administration cannot be implemented by presidential decree alone.</p>

While Trump vaguely promised security guarantees and backed away from demanding a ceasefire, the lack of specifics left Ukraine's position largely unchanged.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As new tariffs are implemented, the retail inventory method (RIM) of accounting, used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort their reported profitability. Unlike cost accounting, which tracks the actual cost of each item, RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio across broad categories. This method is slower to reflect sudden cost increases, potentially causing short-term overstatement of profits when tariffs are imposed.

          <p>Texas health officials have declared an end to the state's largest measles outbreak in over three decades, which infected 762 people and resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The outbreak was declared over after 42 days passed without a new case, a period equivalent to two incubation cycles of the virus. The cluster began in a county with low vaccination rates and spread across the state and into New Mexico. Officials credited a comprehensive response involving testing, vaccination campaigns, and public education for containing the virus but warned that vigilance is still needed due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere and declining vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked over 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law and visa overstays. The department stated that the majority of these revocations were for criminal offenses such as assault, DUI, and burglary, as well as for what it termed "support for terrorism." This action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration, which has included enhanced social media vetting for visa applicants. The administration has specifically targeted some students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, and critics argue that the visa revocations represent an attack on due process and free expression.</p>

The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to propose a new ending where Juliet doesn't die but instead travels to Paris to find herself. The production is praised for its witty book by David West Read and its energetic, dance-party atmosphere, successfully integrating pop anthems from artists like Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own restrictions, typically capping buyers at around 80 to 85 years old. The timing of an annuity purchase is a critical decision that affects costs and payout amounts. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. Purchasing an immediate annuity closer to retirement age can supplement Social Security, while waiting until one's 70s or 80s can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy, though it also carries risks like reduced product availability.</p>

The strike, which began over disputes regarding wages and unpaid work, has already led to the cancellation of flights for approximately 500,000 customers.

          <p>The Trump administration has signaled increased opposition to wind energy projects, citing the need to protect bald and golden eagles. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to enforce the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which prohibits harming the birds without a permit. Critics view this move as another attempt to hinder the renewable energy industry, pointing out that the administration has simultaneously weakened other environmental regulations, such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, to benefit the oil and gas industry. While wind turbines do pose a threat to birds, other factors like cats, buildings, and climate change are far more significant causes of avian mortality.</p>

Meanwhile, shares of Eli Lilly remained stable after its competitor, Novo Nordisk, announced a price cut for its diabetes drug Ozempic for cash-paying patients. This move is not seen as a major threat to Lilly's market position, as the cash-pay market for diabetes treatments is less significant than for weight-loss drugs due to better insurance coverage. Lilly's Zepbound for weight loss is already priced competitively, maintaining its advantage in that key market segment. (not investment advice)</p>
