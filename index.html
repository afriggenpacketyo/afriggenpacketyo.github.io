            <p>Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has rejected calls for denuclearization, dismissing them as a “daydream” by Washington and its allies.

This statement follows a meeting between diplomats from the U.S., South Korea, and Japan, who reaffirmed their commitment to denuclearization. Kim Yo Jong's comments escalate tensions in the region, particularly as North Korea strengthens its ties with Russia.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in New York is set to consider blocking future deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, following a lawsuit challenging President Trump's use of the act. The ACLU is representing two Venezuelan migrants who are facing deportation and are seeking an emergency order to prevent their removal. The Trump administration invoked the AEA to deport alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador, arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a “hybrid criminal state” invading the U.S. The ACLU argues that the law is being improperly applied outside of a war or invasion.</p>

            <p>President Trump has implemented reciprocal tariffs on imports from approximately 90 countries, exceeding a baseline 10% tax on all imports to the U.S. The tariffs, which went into effect on April 9, are intended to address the trade deficit between the U.S. and other nations. Some countries will face only the baseline rate, while others, like China, will face significantly higher rates. Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to inflation and retaliatory measures from trade partners, potentially resulting in serious recessions. China and the European Union have already announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell approximately 3% as China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to President Trump's levies. The U.S. benchmark dropped below $58 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent also tumbled. Traders are concerned that the escalating trade war will trigger a recession, reducing crude oil demand. The potential for increased oil supply from OPEC+ and possible U.S.-Iran negotiations further contribute to the downward pressure on prices. (not investment advice)</p>
