The rally, attended by approximately 36,000 supporters, featured musical performances by Joan Baez and Neil Young, contrasting with Trump's appearance at a UFC event in Miami.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that the reciprocal tariff exemptions for some electronics may be short-lived, indicating that separate tariffs for these products are 'coming soon' under the semiconductor tariffs. Lutnick's comments create confusion about Trump's tariff policy, which has been subject to frequent changes, and Democrats have criticized the changes for causing 'chaos' and a 'crisis of credibility' for Trump. The administration emphasizes the need to reshore manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign countries for essential goods.</p>

This follows Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause for global tariffs, while increasing levies on Chinese imports to 145%. China's commerce ministry called the exemptions a 'small step' by the US, as the Trump administration offered a concession on Friday by announcing that some technological products would be exempted.</p>
