          <p>Following a U.S.-brokered peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a global initiative to nominate former President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Johnson is collaborating with the speaker of the Israeli Knesset to rally parliamentary leaders worldwide for the joint nomination. The deal, which saw the release of all living Israeli hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, has been credited to Trump's diplomatic efforts. Johnson stated that no one is more deserving of the prize, calling it an "objective fact."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study highlights a significant disconnect between the values of Gen Z and the expectations of hiring managers, creating employment challenges for the younger generation. The research found that Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authenticity, and helping others, whereas employers seek candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. This values gap has led some executives to label the generation as "unemployable." The article offers advice for Gen Z job seekers, suggesting they honestly assess their financial goals and consider temporarily adopting more traditional work-centric values to secure employment in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's military has taken control of the government after weeks of widespread, youth-led protests against President Andry Rajoelina, who has fled the country. An elite army unit announced it would establish a committee to govern and organize a transition to a civilian government quickly. The move followed an impeachment vote by parliament after Rajoelina abandoned his post. Protests, dubbed "Gen Z" protests, were fueled by anger over corruption and severe water and electricity shortages, with many citizens welcoming the military's intervention as a "popular revolution."</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively moving to control every layer of its business, from custom chip development to consumer hardware, in a strategic pivot to build a complete AI ecosystem. The company is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators, similar to Apple's vertical integration with its M-series chips. This hardware focus is part of a broader campaign called Stargate, which also includes massive deals with Nvidia and AMD for computing power.

          <p>CBS News, along with most other major media outlets, has declined to agree to new Pentagon press policies that they argue violate the First Amendment and restrict journalists' ability to report on national security. The new rules require formal authorization to publish both classified and controlled unclassified information, a move the Pentagon Press Association calls an unprecedented attempt to limit access and control information. Reporters from outlets including The New York Times and Fox News are preparing to turn in their press passes rather than sign the agreement, which they say would hamper their ability to use unnamed sources and keep the public informed.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, UK Labour leader Keir Starmer addressed the House of Commons with a nuanced statement, tempering celebration with cautious pragmatism. While acknowledging Donald Trump's central role in the deal, Starmer emphasized the long road ahead for a permanent peace and highlighted Britain's behind-the-scenes support. The response from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch was notably partisan, attacking Starmer and downplaying the UK's role. However, several Conservative backbenchers broke from their leader, offering constructive contributions and implicitly condemning her divisive tone.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have become a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. Average HELOC rates have dropped to around 7.84%, making them significantly cheaper than they were a year ago and more competitive than credit cards or personal loans. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they could become even less expensive if the central bank continues its rate-cutting trend. The article advises that a rate at or below the current average can be considered good, but homeowners should shop around and maintain a strong credit profile to secure the best offer.

Cracks are already appearing, with Hamas failing to return all deceased hostages and reasserting armed control in Gaza, while Israel has restricted aid flow in response.

          <p>In response to growing scrutiny over the potential negative impacts of its technology, OpenAI has formed an eight-member expert council to advise on AI safety and user well-being. The council, composed of experts in psychology, psychiatry, and human-computer interaction, will initially focus on products like ChatGPT and Sora to help define healthy AI interactions. This move follows a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into how chatbots affect young users and a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the company. OpenAI has also recently introduced parental controls and an age prediction system to better protect minors on its platforms.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a reader expresses frustration with his group of male friends, whom he feels have not grown or changed in a decade and lack a drive for self-betterment or service to others. The columnist, James Parker, challenges the reader's perspective, questioning if he truly appreciates his friends and suggesting he engage with them on a deeper level. Parker advises that personal change is constant, even if not obvious, and that the weekly gathering may serve as a needed anchor in a fast-changing world. He ultimately encourages the reader to pursue his own desire for growth and service by finding opportunities to help in his community.</p>

          <p>A family is suing the gaming platform Roblox and chat service Discord, alleging their 13-year-old son was targeted by a sexual predator he met in a game. According to the lawsuit, the predator posed as a teenager and coerced the boy into sending explicit photos in exchange for in-game gift cards, then used the photos for extortion. The family's lawsuit is one of dozens filed by families and state attorneys general who claim the platforms fail to protect children from exploitation. Roblox stated it has implemented over 100 new safety features this year and self-reported 23,000 incidents of potentially harmful content.</p>

The attack, which occurred while the governor and his family were home, caused severe damage to the residence, though everyone escaped unharmed. Balmer admitted to police that he harbored hatred toward the governor and had used Molotov cocktails in the assault, which is part of a broader trend of rising political violence in the U.S.</p>

An indictment was unsealed against Chen Zhi, the alleged leader of the scheme, who remains at large. Prosecutors claim his company, Prince Holding Group, ran forced-labor compounds where trafficked individuals were made to carry out cryptocurrency investment scams that defrauded victims worldwide.

          <p>China has implemented sweeping new restrictions on the export of rare earth materials, a move that could significantly disrupt the U.S. defense industry and escalate trade tensions. The new rules specifically target foreign military use and require export licenses for products containing even small amounts of Chinese-processed rare earths. This gives Beijing powerful leverage, as the U.S. is heavily dependent on China for these critical minerals, which are essential components in weapons systems like F-35 jets and Tomahawk missiles. In response, the Trump administration has threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, reigniting fears of a full-blown trade war.</p>

          <p>In the wake of devastating wildfires, California officials are fast-tracking a large-scale fire prevention project in the Santa Monica Mountains. The strategy involves creating a web of fuel breaks by clearing native chaparral, with plans for prescribed burns and the use of goat and sheep herds to graze on flammable invasive grasses. This effort is supported by an executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom that streamlines the environmental approval process for such projects. While fire officials support the tactical advantages of fuel breaks, some fire ecologists express concern that, if not carefully managed, clearing chaparral could inadvertently make the landscape more prone to fire.</p>

The situation is complicated by the fact that Hamas has not yet returned the remains of all 24 deceased Israeli hostages as stipulated in the agreement.

A Lords inquiry found that this action constituted an abuse of her position for personal benefit and could erode public trust.
