          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach over 30C for a second consecutive day. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant impacts on health and social care services. Many regions are expected to meet the criteria for a heatwave, with temperatures potentially topping 34C on Saturday before some relief arrives on Sunday. While record-breaking for 2025, temperatures remain below the June peak of 35.6C in 1976. The Met Office anticipates thundery showers for northern Wales and north-west England, contrasting with dry and hot conditions in the east.

          <p>China's Communist Party is urging local governments to carefully implement austerity measures on lavish banquets, addressing concerns from the food and beverage industry. The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, emphasized that the frugality drive is intended to curb extravagance, not ordinary dining. Some local governments' overzealous scrutiny and cancellation of official receptions have complicated understanding of the regulations, derailing their original intention. The curbs on excessive official meals were introduced after the Central Committee and State Council issued regulations against waste in party and government bodies. Localities have since rolled out their own guidelines, with some extreme cases drawing media attention. The article indicates a need for balance in implementing austerity measures to avoid unintended economic consequences.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Trump's bid to attract investment threatens to undermine corporate spending in the U.S., citing the Nippon Steel Corp.'s buyout of United States Steel Corp. as an example. The U.S. administration's blocking of the deal was driven by political motives, making corporate executives unable to make decisions based only on business criteria. This wrangling could deter global companies from making sizeable investments and acquisitions in the U.S. market. Rising costs and unpredictability are prompting companies to reduce their exposure to the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>
