          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced a surge in after-hours trading after the company announced quarterly revenue and earnings that surpassed expectations, along with optimistic projections for the upcoming second quarter, despite limitations on sales to China. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted advancements in reasoning AI, the rescinding of AI diffusion rules, the development of enterprise AI agents, and industrial AI as key drivers of increased demand. The company is increasing its price target to $170 from $165, maintaining a hold-equivalent rating due to the stock's rapid rise.

Murrill cited issues within the court system, jail staffing, and infrastructure as contributing factors to the escape, including slow-moving criminal cases leading to overcrowding.

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, dealing a setback to a key component of his economic agenda. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to implement sweeping tariffs. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, arguing that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has created a national emergency. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of five U.S. businesses that rely on imports.</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked President Trump's large-scale tariffs imposed on numerous foreign nations, ruling that the levies exceeded the president's legal authority. The court halted the 10% tariffs assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner and blocked tariffs imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada. The Trump administration justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, but the court rejected this interpretation. The White House defended the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits have created a national emergency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the federal sentences of Larry Hoover, who was serving three life terms for running a notorious Chicago drug gang out of a prison cell, according to the White House. The commutation is not expected to put Hoover out of prison immediately, since he still faces state charges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will "aggressively" revoke the visas of Chinese students studying in the US, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said visa criteria will also be revised to "enhance scrutiny" of future visa applicants from China and Hong Kong. The administration has already moved to deport a number of foreign students, while revoking thousands of visas for others, though many of these actions have been blocked by the courts. Many US universities rely on foreign students for a significant chunk of their funding.</p>

          <p>The cost of insuring exposure to U.S. government debt has been rising steadily, hovering near its highest level in two years, as investors grow nervous about the U.S. government's ability to pay its debt. Investors are snapping up credit default swaps (CDS) as insurance in case of a default. The surge in demand for CDS contracts is seen as a hedge against political risk and broader anxiety about U.S. fiscal policy, rather than a market view that the government is verging on failing to meet its obligations. CDS prices reflect how risky a borrower seems and are used to guard against signs of financial trouble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that Harvard should limit the number of international students it admits to create more spots for Americans. His comments followed the Department of Homeland Security's move to revoke the school's ability to enroll foreign students. Trump expressed concern that about one-fourth of Harvard’s student body is made up of international students, suggesting a cap of around 15 percent. He also stated that he wants to ensure that foreign students "are people that can love our country."</p>

Individuals who pleaded guilty to crimes are now arguing that they were unfairly targeted because of their politics. This approach has created an incentive for pardon seekers to demonstrate their fealty to Trump and accuse the Biden Justice Department of singling them out. The president has largely forsaken a more formal Justice Department process for vetting clemency applicants.</p>

While Cramer acknowledged the potential for job displacement, he also pointed out the potential for AI to take over undesirable or dangerous jobs.
