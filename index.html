          <p>A federal judge has denied bail for Sean "Diddy" Combs after a jury convicted him on two prostitution-related felony counts. While acquitted of more severe charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the judge ruled that the convictions mandate his detention pending sentencing. Combs' defense team argued for his release, citing his first-ever conviction and acquittal on the most serious charges, but prosecutors successfully contended that the nature of the crimes requires him to remain in custody. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison for each count.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership is struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's major domestic policy legislation ahead of a July 4th deadline. The bill, which passed narrowly in the Senate, faces opposition from both moderate and conservative factions within the House GOP who are displeased with the Senate's amendments. These changes include steeper cuts to Medicaid and alterations to energy policies. Despite pressure from the White House, key procedural votes were delayed as leaders worked to persuade holdouts, with the party able to afford only a few defections.</p>

          <p>A new book argues that Apple became overly dependent on China, a move described as a "calamitous mistake" given the country's authoritarian nature. However, some analysts, like Harvard's Meg Rithmire, counter that Apple had few realistic alternatives and that missing out on China's wave of innovation would have prevented it from becoming the company it is today. The debate centers on whether Apple was strategically trapped by China or if its deep involvement was a necessary, albeit complex, component of its global success and dominance in the tech industry.</p>

          <p>The DeSantis administration is threatening punitive action, including removal from office, against Key West city commissioners who voted to end a partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Florida's Attorney General stated the city's decision to void the 287(g) agreement, which deputizes local police to perform some federal immigration duties, violates state law and effectively makes Key West a "sanctuary city." Governor DeSantis echoed the warning, emphasizing that local governments must comply with state law and fully participate in federal immigration enforcement programs.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has announced that the historic Griffith Park Pool, closed since 2020, will not reopen and is slated for demolition. A $28-million project will replace the 1927-era pool with two smaller, modern pools and a splash pad, with construction expected to start in 2026. The original plan to reopen the pool was scrapped after workers discovered a severe, unrepairable crack in its foundation that prevented it from retaining water. The new facility aims to provide year-round aquatic access for local communities that have long relied on the public pool.</p>

          <p>President Trump is personally engaging in a significant pressure campaign to ensure passage of his signature tax and spending bill. The White House hosted multiple meetings with House Republican holdouts, including members of the pragmatic Main Street Caucus, in an effort to secure their votes. High-profile figures like Vice President JD Vance and Dr. Mehmet Oz were also involved, with Oz reportedly addressing concerns about the bill's proposed Medicaid cuts. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged the difficulty in securing votes but referred to the president as their "best closer" in these final negotiations.</p>

          <p>Some House Republicans are pushing back against what they describe as intense pressure from the White House to pass President Trump's major legislative package. Lawmakers from both fiscally conservative and moderate wings have voiced concerns, with some, like Rep. Derrick Van Orden, bristling at the implication they are simply following orders. A key point of contention is the bill's $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which could impact rural hospitals.

The motion was initiated by a right-wing Romanian MEP over a perceived lack of transparency concerning text messages exchanged with Pfizer's CEO during COVID-19 vaccine negotiations. While the vote is largely symbolic and not expected to pass, as most major political groups oppose it, it underscores growing frustration within Brussels.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that suspended the right for migrants to apply for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his authority by declaring an "invasion" and unilaterally supplanting immigration laws enacted by Congress. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor existing statutes grant the president the power to create an alternative immigration system in this manner. The ruling has been stayed for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal, but it represents a significant legal setback for the president's hardline immigration agenda.</p>
