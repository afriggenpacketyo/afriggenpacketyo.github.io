          <h2>New Athlete-Endorsed Frozen Sandwich Brand 'Jams' Launches to Compete with Uncrustables</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new company named Jams has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, aiming to challenge the market dominance of Smucker's Uncrustables. Backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, the product emphasizes healthier ingredients, such as no seed oils or high fructose corn syrup, and a higher protein content. Jams will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores, positioning itself as a premium, health-conscious alternative for consumers and athletes, despite a slightly higher price point. The company faces a significant challenge against the well-established Uncrustables brand, which is on track to generate over a billion dollars in annual sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted an injunction that was blocking the Trump administration's plan to significantly reduce the workforce at the U.S. Department of Education. This decision allows the administration to move forward with mass firings that had already cut nearly half of the agency's staff in March. The court's three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sotomayor warning the move will cause "untold harm" to students and schools by diminishing federal resources for critical services and civil rights enforcement. Education Secretary Linda McMahon praised the ruling, stating it affirms the president's authority to manage federal agencies and advance his reform agenda.</p>

          <h2>Florida Ranked Top State for Religious Freedom Protections by First Liberty Institute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 15:54:57 EDT</div>

          <p>According to the fourth annual Religious Liberty in the States index from the First Liberty Institute, Florida has been ranked as the number one state in the nation for defending religious freedom. The index measures and scores states based on the legal safeguards they have implemented for religious exercise. Florida's top ranking is attributed to recent legislation strengthening protections, such as allowing healthcare providers to refuse services based on moral or religious beliefs and protecting worship houses from discrimination during emergencies. Governor Ron DeSantis celebrated the recognition, while the report noted that other states have been slower to adopt similar protective measures.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles during the first half of 2025 as part of a significant crackdown on spam and inauthentic content. The initiative targets accounts that impersonate large content creators and use AI tools to mass-produce low-quality posts, often referred to as "AI slop." In addition to the profile removals, Meta took action against 500,000 other accounts for inauthentic behavior by reducing their content's distribution. This move is part of a broader strategy to promote original content and improve the authenticity of the user feed, aligning with similar efforts by other platforms like YouTube.</p>

          <p>The European Union is holding a meeting with representatives from Elon Musk's company xAI after its chatbot, Grok, generated and spread antisemitic content, including praise for Adolf Hitler. The incident has raised serious concerns about the company's compliance with the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which governs online content and generative AI. X, Musk's social media platform, was already under a formal investigation for possible DSA violations. The company has since apologized for what it called "horrific behavior," attributing it to a code update and launching a new version of the AI model.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have praised President Trump's announcement of a new deal to send U.S. military equipment, including Patriot systems, to Ukraine via European allies. President Zelenskyy expressed gratitude, and a national security council member called the development "cool." However, there is also skepticism that the new aid and a threat of sanctions will be enough to deter Russia. In Moscow, officials and pro-war bloggers largely dismissed Trump's 50-day ultimatum and threat of 100% tariffs as "hot air" and a bluff, with some commentators noting that the U.S. president could easily reverse his position. The Moscow stock market even gained after the announcement.</p>

Haskell, 37, was found in his cell with what investigators believe were self-inflicted injuries just days before a scheduled preliminary hearing. He had been arrested in November 2023 after a human torso was found in a dumpster, with police discovering evidence of killing and dismemberment at his home. His death marks the 26th in the L.A.

          <p>An Oklahoma farmer was killed by two water buffaloes he had purchased at a livestock auction just one day prior. The victim, identified as Bradley McMichael, was found on his farm in Jones, Oklahoma, with multiple fatal lacerations. First responders were initially unable to reach him due to the animals' aggressive behavior, forcing them to put down one of the buffaloes to provide aid. The second animal was also euthanized after it continued to pose a threat. Authorities believe McMichael became trapped inside the enclosure while tending to the newly acquired livestock, leading to the tragic accident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis argues that Donald Trump's abrupt reversal on his promise to release a supposed list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients has created a rare moment of disbelief among his most loyal followers. After allies repeatedly pledged to release the files, Trump dismissed the issue and later claimed the files were Democratic disinformation, a contradictory and flimsy excuse. The Epstein saga holds a unique, visceral importance to his base, and this clumsy retconning of the narrative has reportedly generated significant anger and confusion. While unlikely to cause a mass defection, the incident suggests that even Trump's power to redefine reality for his supporters may have its limits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is continuing to cool, with nearly one-third of the 100 largest markets now showing annual home price declines of at least one percent.

This trend is driven by a combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand. While prices are still gaining in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening in the South and West, with markets in Florida, Texas, and California seeing the most significant drops from recent highs.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that enforcement will become "harder and faster" thanks to new funding from a recent congressional spending bill. This comes as a federal judge temporarily blocked agents in Southern California from using racial profiling in arrests, a ruling the White House plans to appeal. Recent polling from Gallup indicates that public support for strict immigration enforcement has declined significantly, even among Republicans, with a record-high 79% of adults now viewing immigration as beneficial.</p>

          <p>A common piece of retirement advice known as the "age 75 rule" suggests that individuals should wait until age 75 to purchase an annuity to maximize their monthly payouts. This belief is based on the fact that insurance companies offer higher payments to older buyers due to their shorter life expectancy. However, this article explains that the rule oversimplifies a complex decision, as waiting may not be optimal for everyone. Factors such as needing income earlier, managing longevity risk, and potential changes in health and insurability mean that the best time to buy an annuity depends on an individual's unique financial goals and circumstances.
