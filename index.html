          <h2>Syrian Government to Deploy New Force to Quell Deadly Clashes in Southern Region</h2>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has announced the deployment of a new military force to stop deadly sectarian fighting between Bedouin and Druze groups in the country's south. The clashes, centered around Suweida, have reportedly resulted in nearly 600 deaths, with government troops previously accused of killing civilians. This move comes amid reports of a US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria, intended to stabilize the region and protect minority populations. The UN has called for an end to the bloodshed and accountability for widespread human rights violations, including summary executions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe demographic decline, exemplified by small towns like Fregona where a shrinking population and a record-low birth rate threaten community survival. The national fertility rate has dropped to 1.18 babies per woman, far below the replacement level, leading to the closure of schools and local businesses. Despite government incentives like cash bonuses, many Italians cite the high cost of living and lack of affordable childcare as major barriers to having more children. Experts suggest that without systemic changes and increased immigration, Italy's economy and social structure face a precarious future.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has identified the three deputies killed in a recent explosion at a training facility as Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn. All three were veteran members of the specialized Arson Explosives Detail, with a combined 74 years of service. The incident is considered one of the deadliest internal tragedies for the department in years, and a homicide investigation is underway. Authorities are exploring a possible connection between the explosion and explosives that the same deputies had seized from a Santa Monica location the previous day.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from injury, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing is seen as a positive step, as he displayed increased velocity and better control by simplifying his mental approach on the mound. The Dodgers are heavily relying on the health and dependability of Glasnow and fellow pitcher Blake Snell to strengthen their rotation for the second half of the season. His ability to maintain this form will be pivotal for the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Venezuelan migrants, who were controversially transferred from the U.S. to El Salvador's high-security CECOT prison, have been returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. The swap, which secured the release of 10 Americans held by Venezuela, led to emotional reunions for families who had no contact with the detainees for months. Many of the Venezuelans were legally in the U.S. with pending asylum claims when they were abruptly sent to the infamous prison under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The U.S. government had paid El Salvador millions to detain them indefinitely without charge.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers suggests that chemotherapy, while effective against primary tumors, may awaken dormant cancer cells and accelerate their spread to other organs. The findings could help explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. The research team also identified specific drugs that, when used with chemotherapy in mice, could inhibit this process. A clinical trial involving breast cancer patients is now underway to explore these potential new treatment strategies.</p>

The warning, which covers London and the south coast, indicates a likelihood of rapid flooding of homes and businesses, significant transport disruption, and power cuts.

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new electromagnetic weapon design, an 'X-railgun,' intended to be significantly more powerful than the navy's current model. The existing naval railgun, a world-first, has been limited by its power, as excessive current can liquefy metal components and cap projectile weight. The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns, a design they claim will nearly double the force. This would allow it to fire heavier, more destructive projectiles, potentially overcoming a key hurdle in the military application of this advanced technology.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who coped with the horrors of the Vietnam War by imagining a carousel, has turned that vision into a reality in Nederland, Colorado. After battling PTSD for years, Harrison began building the "Carousel of Happiness" in 1986, hand-carving its animals over 26 years. The carousel, which opened in 2010 as a nonprofit, has since brought joy to over a million visitors. For Harrison, the project has been a form of therapy, transforming a personal coping mechanism into a public source of joy and healing for his community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed by assets like the U.S. dollar, a move supporters say will strengthen the dollar's global role. The law is seen as a significant victory for the cryptocurrency industry, which has long advocated for clearer regulations to bring digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. Critics, however, have raised concerns about potential loopholes for money laundering. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to accommodate a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures, particularly concerning anti-money-laundering (AML) efforts due to their cross-border and pseudonymous nature. This warning comes as the stablecoin market gains momentum, fueled by the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies and growing interest from regulators like the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The adviser emphasized that these borderless instruments are at the forefront of the monetary policy debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acting ICE director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency will use government data from programs like Medicaid to locate and arrest immigrants, including those with criminal records. He also stated that while he is not a proponent of the practice, he will continue to allow ICE agents to wear masks during operations due to safety concerns, citing a more than 800% increase in attacks on officers. Lyons attributed the rise in tension to the administration's expanded immigration enforcement and the prevalence of "sanctuary" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation.</p>

          <p>General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, a provincial police commissioner in South Africa, has garnered widespread public support after making explosive allegations of corruption within President Cyril Ramaphosa's administration.

This unprecedented move has shaken the government but resonated with a public deeply concerned about organized crime and corruption. Despite the minister's denial, the general is being hailed as a hero for standing up to political pressure in a country with low public trust in the police.</p>

          <p>Prominent supporters of President Donald Trump are rallying to his defense after The Wall Street Journal published a story about a letter he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. This renewed support comes after days of criticism from his own base over the administration's handling of the Epstein files. The situation shifted when Trump denied the letter's authenticity, sued the newspaper, and ordered the Justice Department to seek the release of Epstein-related grand jury testimony. This sequence of events appears to have successfully redirected supporters' anger towards the media and unified the MAGA movement behind the president.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as common and benign in older adults, occurs when leg veins struggle to send blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. The doctor confirmed the diagnosis via ultrasound and blood work but found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots, declaring the president to be in "excellent health." Treatment for mild CVI typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise.</p>

          <p>A Nashville judge has ordered Tennessee prison officials to deactivate a death-row inmate's implanted heart-regulating device just before his scheduled execution. The ruling addresses concerns from Byron Black's attorneys that the device could repeatedly shock him during the lethal injection, causing what they describe as a torturous outcome. The order requires medical professionals to be present to disable the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator moments before the execution proceeds. The state is expected to appeal the decision, which adds a complex medical and ethical layer to the execution protocol.</p>
