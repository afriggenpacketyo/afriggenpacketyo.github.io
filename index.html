            <p>A shooting at Florida State University's campus in Tallahassee resulted in two fatalities and six injuries, with the suspect, identified as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, an FSU student and the son of a Leon County sheriff's deputy, now in custody. Ikner allegedly used his mother's former service weapon, along with a shotgun, during the attack, with police responding to the active shooter call from the student union area. The two individuals killed were not students, and the campus was secured by law enforcement after the incident, with classes and events canceled. The incident prompted a multi-agency response, including the FBI and ATF, and sparked widespread shock and concern among the FSU community.</p>

            <p>Mondelēz International has confirmed that the 360g dark chocolate Toblerone bar will no longer be sold in the UK after nearly six decades on shelves.

The original Toblerone bar was first invented in 1908, with the dark chocolate version released in 1969. The decision comes as the UK heads into the Easter bank holiday weekend, when chocolate sales are expected to be elevated.</p>

            <p>PBS initially postponed the release of "Break the Game," a film about a trans video gamer, due to concerns about political backlash. This decision followed increased scrutiny from legislators and the Trump administration regarding public media funding. However, after inquiries from the media, PBS reversed its decision and scheduled the film for broadcast during Pride Month. The episode highlights the challenges faced by independent filmmakers and the pressures of self-censorship within public broadcasting.</p>

            <p>With prices rising due to shifting tariffs and trade tensions, many millennial workers are tightening their budgets. One millennial shares adjustments she and her husband are making to stay financially afloat, from cutting nonessentials to finding smarter ways to stretch every dollar. They have been replacing what could be affected and choosing where to cut back, such as reducing a live TV Hulu subscription and halting nonessential spending. A longer mortgage timeline is also a casualty of this time of high-tariff uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Apple's smartphone shipments in China fell in the first quarter of 2025, making it the only top-five handset vendor in China to record a decline, according to IDC data. This decline occurs ahead of new tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Apple's manufacturing supply chain and China's smartphone industry face much uncertainty because of Trump's new tariff regime. The Trump administration imposed cumulative tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese goods this month, while Beijing slapped a 125 per cent tariff on US goods.</p>

            <p>New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that college remains a worthwhile investment for most graduates, despite soaring costs. The total cost of a college degree is around $180,000 in 2024, up from $140,000 in the late 90s. However, the typical college graduate can expect a median 12.5% return on their investment in higher education, the agency says. The researchers considered out-of-pocket costs, earnings outcomes, and potential earnings without a degree.</p>

            <p>The IRS is considering revoking Harvard University’s tax-exempt status following the school's refusal to comply with demands from the Trump administration regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

The Department of Homeland Security is also threatening to revoke Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program status.

            <p>Canadian small businesses are taking Trump's tariffs personally, as the trade relationship with the U.S. has been integral to both national economies. A survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) indicates that over half of surveyed businesses agree that the U.S. is not a reliable trading partner. Some Canadian businesses are highlighting Canadian patriotism on their menus and in stores, while others are halting purchases of U.S. products. The tariffs are causing emotional distress and cost increases for many Canadians.</p>

            <p>Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), resigned from his job at a private cybersecurity firm after being the target of an executive order by President Donald Trump. Trump's order called Krebs a "significant bad-faith actor" and directed the attorney general to review his actions while director of CISA. Krebs has long maintained that the 2020 election was safe and secure, at odds with Trump who made false claims of election fraud. Krebs' defiance of Trump ultimately led to his firing in late 2020 as CISA director.</p>
