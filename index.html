          <p>R&B singer Cassie Ventura testified in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, detailing alleged physical and psychological abuse during their 10-year relationship. Ventura recounted instances of violence, including being knocked down, kicked, and stomped on, stating the abuse occurred "frequently." She described Combs' control over her appearance, career, and social interactions, and alleged he introduced her to "freak offs," drug-fueled events where she was forced to perform sex acts with hired sex workers. Ventura testified she felt disgusted and humiliated by these encounters, but feared Combs' anger and potential blackmail. The article contextualizes her testimony within the broader allegations against Combs and the potential consequences he faces if convicted.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan was indicted on federal charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings after allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant avoid ICE agents.

Dugan's lawyers moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing her actions were protected by judicial immunity. The case has drawn condemnation from Democratic leaders and lawyers, while the Trump administration has defended the prosecution as a warning that no one is above the law.</p>
