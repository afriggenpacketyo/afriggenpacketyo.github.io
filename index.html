          <h2>New Research Suggests Personality Traits Can Be Intentionally Changed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:13:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer Olga Khazan, dissatisfied with her anxious and introverted personality, embarked on a year-long journey to consciously redesign her traits. This process, detailed in her book "Me, But Better," involved stepping outside her comfort zone with activities like improv comedy. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala supports this, explaining that personality is not fixed and can be shifted by intentionally and repeatedly changing one's patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. The article suggests that while the principles are simple, the execution requires significant and sustained effort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, identifies the biggest red flag in a job interview as a candidate who is unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company. She gauges this by asking what they think the company could do better. Conversely, she is most impressed by candidates who have done their research and can offer genuine, constructive feedback on the business. Johnson values problem-solvers who can adapt quickly, especially in a startup environment, and who are open about their past mistakes and learnings.</p>

          <p>Kerr County officials provided a significant update on the search efforts following the deadly flash floods in central Texas, confirming that nearly 100 people previously listed as missing have been located safely. This development reduces the number of unaccounted-for individuals in the county to just three. The progress is attributed to extensive, coordinated search operations involving over a thousand personnel and volunteers. Despite this positive news, the flood's death toll in Kerr County stands at 107, with recovery efforts ongoing.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for flouting a 2021 law by restoring the Confederate-era names of several U.S. Army bases. Hegseth claims to be renaming the bases after different historical American soldiers who conveniently share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. The House Armed Services Committee voted to block this move, with some Republicans joining Democrats in condemning the action as a transparent attempt to circumvent Congress. The article highlights the controversial and often incompetent histories of figures like Braxton Bragg.</p>

          <p>This article presents a personal and historical examination of Oklahoma, arguing that its story of land theft from Indigenous nations, racial violence, and sanitized historical narratives reflects the broader American experience. The author recounts re-enacting a land run in school and explores the state's pride in figures known as "Sooners," who cheated to claim land. The piece contrasts this violent history with the visionary efforts of Edward McCabe to create an all-Black state, suggesting that understanding Oklahoma's contradictions is key to understanding the nation's current political divisions.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for the Trump administration's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. This shift corresponds with a growing perception that the program is deporting more people than expected and is not prioritizing dangerous criminals. The survey also highlights a persistent public demand for the administration to focus more on lowering prices, as disapproval of the president's handling of inflation reaches its highest point yet.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that recent U.S. trade policy signals a strategic shift away from partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and towards a more transactional, rent-seeking model. The author contends that by dramatically raising tariffs and demanding mandatory purchases, Washington is monetizing access to its market rather than fostering mutually beneficial economic integration. This approach threatens to undermine the competitiveness and sovereignty of ASEAN economies, turning them into "fee for access" partners rather than strategic allies. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, improved professionalism, better data analysis, and advanced scouting mean goalkeepers are now more prepared than ever, often knowing a taker's tendencies in advance.

          <p>An excerpt from Nathalia Holt's new non-fiction book, "The Beast in the Clouds," details the 1928 expedition planned by Theodore Roosevelt's sons, Ted and Kermit. The brothers set out for the unexplored regions of China with a secret, ambitious goal: to be the first to hunt and acquire a specimen of the giant panda. At the time, the black-and-white bear was a legendary creature, so rare that many in the Western world did not believe it was real, making it the ultimate prize for museum collectors.</p>

          <p>During the final curtain call for the opera "Il trovatore" at London's Royal Opera House, a cast member staged a protest by unfurling a large Palestinian flag. Video of the incident shows a brief struggle as a stage official unsuccessfully attempted to take the flag from the performer, who held onto it for the remainder of the applause. The Royal Opera House issued a statement calling the unauthorized action "completely inappropriate" and reiterated its commitment to political impartiality. The protest occurred on the closing night of the production.</p>

          <p>Scientists and health agencies are warning of an increased risk of vibriosis, a potentially serious infection caused by Vibrio bacteria, in European coastal waters. The bacteria thrive in warm, low-salinity brackish water, and climate change is creating more favorable conditions in areas like the Baltic Sea and North Sea. Infections, which can cause severe illness or even death, typically occur from eating raw shellfish or through open wounds exposed to contaminated water. Authorities advise caution, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems during summer heatwaves.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Lucas Schaefer's debut comic novel, "The Slip," introduces the setting of an Austin, Texas, boxing gym and a central mystery. The scene opens during an early morning workout, where a 68-year-old character named Bob Alexander is distracted from the exercise. His preoccupation stems from an anonymous note he received the previous night related to his nephew, who disappeared a decade earlier. The strange note suggests that the long-dormant missing person's case may be about to resurface in a new and puzzling way.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acclaimed comic book author Grant Morrison pushes back against conservative criticism of Superman's immigrant identity by highlighting the character's socialist origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was a "champion of the oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and slum landlords. Morrison explains that the patriotic "Truth, Justice, and the American Way" identity was a later addition during World War II, and that the character has evolved to reflect the times, from a 1950s suburban patriarch to a 1980s yuppie.</p>
