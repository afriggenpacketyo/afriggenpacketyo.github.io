        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the five years since George Floyd's murder and the subsequent rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. While the movement sparked global protests and initially raised hopes for significant change, particularly in the realm of police reform, many of those promises remain unfulfilled. The Trump administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, along with continued instances of police violence against Black people, contribute to a sense of disappointment. However, the article also notes positive shifts in the way racism is discussed and the implementation of some policy changes, such as bans on the knee-to-neck maneuver used on Floyd. The article emphasizes that the struggle for racial justice and equality continues. </p>

Amnesty International warns that lifting the embargo could worsen the human rights situation and endanger civilians.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 12:03:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the seven-day week, tracing it back to the Bible and the commandment to work for six days and rest on the seventh. It contrasts this with historical attempts to alter the work week and modern cultural extremes of either escaping work or glorifying busyness. The article cites research showing the importance of both meaningful work and regular rest for productivity and overall well-being, referencing the concept of "job crafting" and studies on the productivity ceiling. Ultimately, the article argues that the biblical model of balancing work and rest offers a path to a fulfilling life.</p>

Trump also touted his administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the military, claiming a new record in peacetime recruiting. However, CBS News found that military records show enlistments began rebounding from a pandemic slump long before Election Day, suggesting recruitment reforms introduced during former President Joe Biden's term may be the cause of the increase.</p>
