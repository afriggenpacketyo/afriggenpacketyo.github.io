          <p>A new North Korean warship was damaged during its launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un. The ship slid off the ramp and became stuck after the flatcar failed to move alongside it, causing damage to the shipâ€™s bottom. Kim blamed military officials, scientists, and shipyard operators for the accident. The damaged vessel was likely in the same class as the countryâ€™s first destroyer, unveiled on April 25, which experts assessed as the Northâ€™s largest and most advanced warship to date.</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats call "the nuclear option." The waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked in 50 years and will sue if Congress uses the Congressional Review Act.</p>

Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp says the claims are untrue, noting that Whites remain economically the strongest group in South Africa. While violent attacks on farmers occur, they are not generally racially motivated, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.
