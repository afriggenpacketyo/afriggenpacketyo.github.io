          <p>During a three-day spring festival, no current members of Prime Minister Ishiba's cabinet visited the Yasukuni Shrine, a controversial Shinto shrine linked to Japan's militaristic past, partly due to diplomatic considerations. Ishiba sent a ritual offering, drawing protests from China and disappointment from South Korea, who view the shrine as a symbol of Japanese militarism, as it honors convicted war criminals along with 2.4 million war dead. Relations between Japan and its neighbors have been improving after years of tension over historical and territorial issues. Some members of the ruling party, however, did visit the shrine during the festival.</p>

          <p>The European Union has levied significant fines against Apple and Meta for violating the bloc's Digital Markets Act. Apple was fined $571 million for preventing developers from informing users about alternative offers outside the App Store, while Meta was fined $228 million for illegally requiring users to consent to data sharing or pay for an ad-free service. Apple plans to appeal, arguing the EU is unfairly targeting them, while Meta claims the EU is handicapping American businesses. The EU's decision risks retaliation from the U.S. President, who has previously criticized the EU's regulatory actions against American tech companies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that a majority of Americans are more concerned about running out of money in retirement than they are about death. High inflation, taxes, and uncertainty surrounding Social Security benefits contribute to this fear, with Gen Xers being the most anxious demographic. Americans estimate needing $1.26 million for a comfortable retirement, a figure far exceeding the median retirement savings of $87,000. Financial advisors recommend seeking professional help to navigate these uncertain economic times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's public finances are under increasing strain as government borrowing exceeded expectations, adding pressure ahead of potential US tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is seeking a trade deal with the US to avoid these tariffs, but faces the challenge of sticking to self-imposed borrowing rules, potentially requiring spending cuts or tax increases. The IMF has lowered its growth forecast for the UK in 2025, citing tariffs, rising inflation, and borrowing costs as contributing factors. The government aims to cut waste to manage public finances amid rising debt interest payments.</p>

          <p>Sports radio personality Mike Francesa has strongly criticized the New York Knicks' offensive game plan following their Game 2 loss to the Detroit Pistons, leveling the series. Francesa specifically targeted head coach Tom Thibodeau for relying too heavily on Jalen Brunson in isolation plays, arguing that the stagnant offense is not sustainable against stronger teams. He questioned Brunson's constant attempts to draw fouls and the overall lack of team involvement in the offensive strategy. Francesa expressed concerns about the Knicks' ability to compete against top teams like the Boston Celtics with their current approach.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to eliminate the driving test backlog by next summer, aiming to reduce waiting times to a maximum of seven weeks by 2026. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged that current wait times are unacceptable and announced plans to provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests per month. Measures to address the delays include doubling training capacity for driving examiners and reintroducing overtime pay incentives.

          <p>An analysis of the Star Wars franchise questions whether the emphasis on inherited destiny and chosen ones undermines the message of rebellion and egalitarianism. The author argues that the twist in "The Empire Strikes Back," revealing Darth Vader as Luke Skywalker's father, shifted the focus from political animosity to a less compelling Oedipal mythos. This narrative has influenced subsequent blockbusters, leading to a reliance on characters born with special abilities rather than ordinary individuals fighting for change. The author advocates for a return to the original film's theme of ordinary rebels taking down a dictator.</p>

          <p>The State Bar of California has admitted to using AI to develop some multiple-choice questions for its bar exam, triggering controversy and outrage. This revelation comes after test takers complained about technical problems and irregularities during the February exam. The State Bar claims the AI-developed questions were reviewed by experts and performed well, but critics argue it represents a conflict of interest and raises concerns about the exam's validity. The California Supreme Court was reportedly unaware of the AI use until recently.</p>
