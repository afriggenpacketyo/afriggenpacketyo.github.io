          <p>This article provides an overview of the annual "Money Issue" from CBS's "Sunday Morning," which focuses on the multifaceted topic of retirement. The segments cover a range of subjects, from the financial security of the Social Security system and the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement to lifestyle choices like creating bucket lists and moving abroad. The program also highlights unique retirement paths, including social media "grandfluencers," the use of an Air Force base as a home for retired warplanes, and a sanctuary for chimpanzees retired from scientific research.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old man from New Jersey, Thomas Daniel Gibbs, has been missing for a week within Grand Canyon National Park, where a "mega-fire" is currently burning. The Dragon Bravo Fire has consumed over 100,000 acres, destroying historic structures like the Grand Canyon Lodge and closing the North Rim for the season. Search efforts for Gibbs are concentrated near Grandview Point, and authorities are asking for any information from the public. The fire's intensity has created its own weather systems, complicating firefighting efforts.</p>

          <p>A small, magnitude 3.0 earthquake struck near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing a brief tremor that was felt across the New York metropolitan area. The event occurred at a depth of about 6.2 miles and, while noticeable to residents, was not strong enough to cause any damage. New York City's emergency management confirmed no immediate reports of major impacts. Such mild tremors are somewhat uncommon in the northeastern United States, prompting a flurry of social media activity.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat, an incident that also caused a passenger to be thrown overboard. The passenger was safely recovered and is expected to be okay, but the whale was confirmed dead shortly after the collision. Due to tidal conditions and the whale's location on a shallow sandbar, officials plan to tow the carcass for a necropsy on Monday. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center has advised boaters to use caution in the area.</p>

The province reported 2,892 new cases in the last week, with the majority concentrated in the city of Foshan. While there have been no severe or fatal infections reported, provincial and national health officials are calling for swift and forceful action to contain the outbreak. The disease causes fever, joint pain, and fatigue but cannot be spread through direct person-to-person contact.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old woman was arrested in New Zealand after a 2-year-old girl was discovered alive inside a suitcase she was traveling with on a bus. A bus driver became concerned about a moving bag in the storage compartment during a stop and found the child, who was very hot but physically unharmed. The girl is now hospitalized for medical assessment, and the woman faces charges of ill-treatment and neglect of a child. Police commended the bus driver for his immediate action, which may have prevented a more tragic outcome.</p>

In an interview, Bryant described how Croft, who died in 1986, took advantage of him when he was a 16-year-old student at the company in 1978. The National Youth Theatre issued a statement expressing sorrow and solidarity with Bryant and other victims of the same perpetrator. Bryant also revealed he was sexually assaulted by five male MPs during his time in Westminster but did not report them due to fear and a lack of a proper system.</p>

          <p>The use of artificial intelligence for damage assessment, as recently implemented by car rental company Hertz, may soon expand to the hotel industry. This practice, termed 'algorithmic auditing,' involves using AI to systematically identify and charge for previously overlooked issues, from minor scratches on a car to smoking in a hotel room. While businesses see it as a way to automate loss prevention and improve efficiency, experts warn of a potential customer backlash. The trend highlights a growing tension between operational efficiency and customer trust, as automated systems may lack the nuanced judgment of human discretion.</p>

Additionally, civil litigation involving Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre could lead to more records being unsealed.

Investigators were able to extract a partial male DNA profile from one of the victims using Y-STR testing, which specifically targets male DNA. Although an initial potential match in an FBI database was later ruled out after more advanced testing, officials remain optimistic.

Campaigners allege the move was influenced by utility giant DTE Energy, which was reportedly unhappy with commissioner Alessandra Carreon's stance on clean energy and rate increases. The new appointee, Shaquila Myers, previously worked for a pro-business legislative leader, raising concerns that the regulatory board will be less likely to challenge utility interests on critical rate and infrastructure decisions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a recent bill signed by President Trump, which allocates $170 billion to the Department of Homeland Security, represents a grave threat to American democracy. The author contends that this massive funding will turbocharge the militarization of immigration enforcement, leading to more unconstitutional acts by ICE, such as abductions and family separations. The piece calls for widespread opposition and activism to protect immigrants and hold public officials accountable, asserting that the system being built to target immigrants will ultimately affect all Americans' rights.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Zhejiang University in China have developed the "Darwin Monkey," the world's first brain-like computer built with over 2 billion artificial neurons. The system is powered by 960 proprietary Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, which simulate over 100 billion synapses, the connections between neurons in a biological brain. This groundbreaking computing system has already been used to perform complex tasks such as content generation and logical reasoning. The development marks a significant step toward achieving more advanced, brain-like artificial intelligence.</p>

This shift comes amid a projected $56 billion funding gap in global development, which threatens progress on health and poverty.

          <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's number-one golfer, has made a cameo appearance in the movie "Happy Gilmore 2," which could help soften his public image as an unflappable, robotic competitor.

This appearance provides fans a glimpse of a more fun-loving personality, contrasting with his intensely focused and often drama-free dominance on the golf course.

The move, supported by the current pro-European government, could lead to jail sentences of one to five years and potentially a ban on the country's successful Communist Party (KSCM). The KSCM leader has condemned the law as a political attack by the government to silence critics. The decision is also ironic as it was signed by President Petr Pavel, himself a former member of the Communist Party.</p>
