          <p>Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Hillary Scholten revealed that she was on a suspected killer's target list following a fatal shooting in Minnesota, expressing shock and concern. Scholten emphasized the need for answers from the FBI and Capitol Police regarding why she was targeted, as well as the importance of bipartisan condemnation of political violence. Despite postponing a town hall meeting due to safety concerns, she affirmed her determination to continue her work and not be intimidated by such threats, characterizing them as "true domestic terrorism". Scholten also criticized Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee for his insensitive social media posts about the shooting, demanding an apology and the removal of the posts. The congresswoman stated she will remain committed to serving her constituents despite the dangers, and that she will not be intimidated. The event prompted a reaction from fellow legislators and underscores the current dangers facing lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, has voiced concern over Iranian state television urging citizens to delete the messaging app, claiming it's used by Israel to target individuals. Meta refuted these claims, emphasizing that WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring privacy between sender and recipient. The company also stated it does not track precise location data or provide bulk information to governments, further disputing the Iranian government's accusations. This warning from Iran comes amid escalating conflict with Israel and increased internet restrictions within the country, limiting public access to information. Meta has faced similar targeting by Iran's government during times of unrest, and the company remains committed to transparency and user privacy.</p>

          <p>The film ‚ÄúTrans Los Angeles‚Äù by director Kase Pe√±a portrays the diverse experiences of transgender individuals in Los Angeles through three vignettes. Inspired by the lack of authentic representation, Pe√±a drew from her personal experiences and stories from the trans community to create the film. The segments explore themes such as ICE raids, spirituality, sex work, and romantic relationships, highlighting both the struggles and the beauty of being human in L.A. The director intentionally cast transmasculine actor Jordan Gonzalez to play a cisgender role in one of the segments, seeking to break industry typecasting. Ultimately, the film seeks to provide a unique perspective on the trans experience, emphasizing the freedom to be oneself.</p>

The announcement follows the postponement of Ozomatli's free show at Grand Performances and concerns about the performance of Papi Castrill√≥n due to curfew restrictions.

An oncoming box truck struck their vehicle, and it is under investigation whether the truck directly hit the couple or if the collision with the SUV pushed the vehicle into them. Pena Jr. joined the Sheriff‚Äôs Department in July 2022 and was assigned to Men‚Äôs Central Jail, and he is survived by his mother, stepfather, and four stepsiblings.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-on-year decline in May, marking the steepest drop since September 2024, primarily due to falling shipments to the U.S. and China. This decline was softer than economists' forecasts but still represents a reversal from April's gains, as the country grapples with trade uncertainties. The Bank of Japan has acknowledged that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors, which could lead to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The U.S. currently imposes a 10% baseline tariff on exports from Japan, which could potentially increase to 24% if a trade deal is not reached by July 9 (not investment advice).</p>

Decker is wanted on multiple counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping after his daughters were found dead following a planned visitation with him. The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his arrest, as he is considered dangerous and may be armed. The Chelan County Sheriff's Office has asked the public to remain vigilant, especially in the Teanaway valley and Blewett Pass areas, as tracking teams believe they may have spotted Decker.</p>

These projects could help address land-utilization issues, as many coal mines have closed since 2010. Such projects are symbolic of a just energy transition, turning "abandoning" into "rebuilding."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with on passport applications and to select "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. This decision expands on an earlier ruling and comes after a lawsuit filed by transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs who claimed the policy was discriminatory. The judge reaffirmed that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their case, as the Trump administration failed to provide a rationale for the new passport policy.</p>

Former officials and law enforcement analysts have criticized the cuts, arguing they drain the department of experienced agents and leaders, potentially diminishing investigative capacity.

          <p>Democratic Senator Tina Smith confronted Republican Senator Mike Lee regarding a social media post he made following the Minnesota lawmaker shootings, expressing the pain it caused her and others. Lee's post, which has since been deleted, was criticized for being insensitive and exploiting the tragedy for political gain. Smith stated that Lee has not apologized for the post, and she criticized President Trump for pardoning people who attacked the base of the government. The senator said that the current dynamic in the country is very challenging, and she is hoping that her talking with Lee will cause him to think more about the hateful things that he has been putting out on his personal X account.</p>

          <p>Texas has ceased providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, shifting course after building only a fraction of the originally planned barrier. The decision comes after state lawmakers approved a new budget that does not include continued funding for the project. Abbott's office stated that renewed federal assets in Texas allowed the state to adjust aspects of state-funded border security efforts, citing President Trump's efforts to curb immigration. The state has completed 65 miles of border wall since construction began, and funds previously allocated for the wall will allow work on it to continue through 2026.</p>
