        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is expected to peak on August 12-13. However, this year's spectacle will be significantly diminished by a bright waning gibbous moon, which will be 84% full. According to the American Meteor Society, the moonlight is projected to reduce visibility by at least 75%, lowering the expected hourly meteor count from around 50 to just 10-20. For better viewing, experts suggest looking for the meteors a week after the peak when the sky will be darker. The Perseids are caused by debris from the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle interacting with Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The conviction of nurse Lucy Letby for murdering and attempting to murder infants is facing renewed scrutiny as experts question the medical evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense. A BBC Panorama investigation highlights the complexities, focusing on the case of Baby O, where explanations for his death—such as impact injuries, air embolism, or accidental needle piercing during resuscitation—are all being contested by various medical specialists. This debate reveals a lack of consensus among experts and raises significant questions about the reliability of the evidence used in the trial, which the Criminal Cases Review Commission is now evaluating.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, are facing a significant backlash amid allegations of built-in security vulnerabilities. A Chinese state media outlet has publicly labeled the chips as unsafe and called for a consumer boycott, claiming the US government may have embedded "back doors" for surveillance. This narrative of distrust persists despite Nvidia's chief security officer issuing a firm denial, stating there are no back doors, kill switches, or spyware in the company's products. The commentary reflects escalating tech tensions and a push for domestic alternatives within China.</p>

          <p>Five journalists from Al Jazeera were killed in an Israeli airstrike near Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The broadcaster condemned the incident as a "targeted assassination" of its staff, who were in a designated press tent. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had targeted one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, a claim Al Jazeera and press freedom groups dispute. This event has intensified concerns over the safety of journalists in the region, where many international outlets rely on local reporters for coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's military has shrunk to approximately 450,000 personnel, a 20% reduction in just six years, primarily due to the nation's critically low birth rate. With a rate of 0.75 babies per woman, the world's lowest, the country is struggling to maintain its required troop levels for national defense against North Korea. A recent study suggested a minimum of 500,000 soldiers are needed, placing South Korea in a difficult strategic position. This demographic challenge has prompted debates about increasing the defense budget and potentially extending conscription to women to address the personnel shortfall.</p>

Run by the charity Gen.Ukrainian, the camp offers group therapy, art sessions, and recreational activities to help them cope with the ambiguous loss and trauma. Psychologists at the camp explain that these children exist in a "frozen state," unable to grieve properly while holding onto hope. The initiative aims to provide a supportive environment where these children can connect with peers who share their painful experience and begin to heal.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy suffered a significant setback in their MLS season, losing 4-0 to the Seattle Sounders at home. The scoring began with an own goal by Galaxy defender Julián Aude in the 25th minute. The Sounders extended their lead in the second half, with Danny Musovski scoring twice and Snydell Brunell adding a fourth goal to seal the decisive victory. The loss comes after a successful run in the Leagues Cup for the Galaxy, but it severely damages their already slim chances of making the MLS playoffs. The match also featured a ceremony honoring the Galaxy's 2005 championship team.</p>

This expansion into the energy market comes as Tesla faces declining EV sales in Europe and increased competition from other automakers, representing a strategic diversification for the company.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, scientists explain that newly formed ones produce a unique form of "music." When a black hole is created, such as from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in spacetime vibrates and radiates gravitational waves as it settles into a perfect, stable shape. These vibrations, akin to the ringing of a bell, are a pure tone determined only by the black hole's mass and spin. This phenomenon offers a way to study these celestial objects during their brief, dynamic youth before they become completely introverted.</p>

          <p>China has launched a national childcare subsidy program offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three, aiming to address its low birth rate. Analysts suggest the scheme's impact will vary significantly by region, potentially providing a greater economic boost to less affluent areas. For example, the subsidy represents over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai.

          <p>A violent attack outside a nightclub in Santa Lucia, Ecuador, left eight people dead and two others injured. According to police, gunmen arrived in two pickup trucks and opened fire on a crowd of people gathered outside the venue in the early morning hours. The shooting occurred in the Guayas province, which is currently under a state of emergency declared by the president to combat rampant gang violence. The motive for the attack is still under investigation as Ecuador grapples with a significant increase in homicides compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in western Colorado are battling two major wildfires that have burned over 120,000 acres. The larger of the two, the Lee Fire, was caused by lightning and has forced evacuations in two counties, threatening homes and infrastructure near the town of Meeker. The fires are being fueled by severe drought and high winds, creating dangerous conditions that have sometimes forced crews to pull back. While resources are being deployed to the area, forecasters predict that the hot, dry, and windy weather will continue, posing an ongoing challenge for containment efforts.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck the province of Balikesir in northwestern Turkey, resulting in the death of one person and injuring 29 others. The victim was an 81-year-old woman who was pulled from the rubble in the town of Sindirgi, the quake's epicenter. The tremors caused 16 buildings to collapse and were felt as far away as Istanbul. Search and rescue operations have concluded, but the event serves as a stark reminder of Turkey's location on major tectonic plates and its high seismic vulnerability, following the devastating earthquakes in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost a frustrating game to the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4, failing to capitalize on numerous opportunities and leaving a season-high 16 runners on base. Despite drawing 13 walks, the Dodgers' offense struggled in key moments, going just one for ten with runners in scoring position. Manager Dave Roberts expressed his frustration after the game, particularly criticizing a baserunning error by Shohei Ohtani and a key strikeout with the bases loaded. The loss narrows the Dodgers' lead in the NL West as the bullpen once again surrendered a late lead.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new measures designed to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The plan aims to address a situation where there are significantly more graduates than available job vacancies in some areas. By cutting red tape, the new regulations will allow health trusts to recruit more proactively, even before vacancies formally arise, and to temporarily convert some support posts into midwifery roles. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the news but stated the true test will be whether graduates can actually secure jobs.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' 27-13 preseason win against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance that appears to be closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing 7 of 14 passes and rushing seven times for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. In contrast, his competitor Taylor Heinicke looked rusty in his first preseason action. Another standout was defensive end Caleb Murphy, an undrafted free agent who recorded two sacks, making a compelling case for a spot on the 53-man roster.</p>
