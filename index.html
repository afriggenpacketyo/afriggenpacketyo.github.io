          <h2>Early Spring Heatwaves Intensify Due to Climate Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 08:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>An analysis of recent heat waves in South Asia reveals that climate change is causing earlier, more frequent, and hotter extreme heat events. These early heat waves are particularly dangerous because people are not yet acclimatized and infrastructure may not be prepared. The study emphasizes the need for communities to take proactive measures such as staying hydrated, avoiding direct sunlight, and recognizing the signs of heat-related illnesses. South Asia serves as a warning for other regions facing similar trends due to climate change, including increased mortality, disrupted food supplies, and overloaded power grids.</p>

          <p>After over two years, vehicles trapped in a mechanical stacked car park in central London are finally being released to their owners.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst rising stress levels in young people, mental health days are gaining traction as a way for kids to cope with anxiety and depression. While at least 12 states have passed laws allowing excused absences for mental health reasons, some school officials worry about the impact on attendance. Experts suggest using mental health days as a preventative tool rather than a crisis intervention, encouraging activities like outdoor time, reading, or catching up on sleep. These days can also provide insights into what's missing from a child's life, leading to long-term stress reduction.</p>
