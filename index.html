          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from preventing foreign students from traveling to the United States to study at Harvard University. The ruling came hours after Harvard called the policy illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The university argued that the action was a "government vendetta" against Harvard, violating the school's First Amendment rights. The Trump administration sought to halt billions in federal funding to the school after Harvard rejected demands to change disciplinary practices and address antisemitism, though Harvard contends it is being punished for protected speech. The judge's decision allows international students to continue their studies while the legal battle proceeds.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies, escalating a feud between the two. This could cost Musk billions, as SpaceX and Tesla benefit from various government programs. Musk responded by threatening to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, though he later walked back the statement. Tesla benefits indirectly through regulatory credits and electric vehicle tax credits, and the end of these could cost Tesla billions. The feud was ignited by Musk's criticism of Trump's domestic policy bill, and the article explores the potential financial ramifications for both companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The attorney stated that the system failed Decker, as he was unable to receive help through veterans' resources. Despite some restrictions on visitation due to mental health concerns, Decker was described as an "active dad" before the incident. The attorney emphasized that Decker was never violent towards his ex-wife or daughters, and that the ex-wife has love and empathy for Travis in his core. The ex-wife and her attorney are now advocating for changes in mental health resources for veterans and reforms to the Amber Alert system.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults in the criminal system. In many states, time spent in detention awaiting trial does not count toward their ultimate incarceration. This adds months to their confinement, impacting their rehabilitation and straining resources. Policy experts argue that this practice undermines the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system and violates fundamental rights.</p>
