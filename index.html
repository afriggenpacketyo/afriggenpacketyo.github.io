Scheffler's strong performance included ten birdies, effectively overcoming a double bogey on the 14th hole.

          <p>Robert Andrews Jr., a Newport man appearing as a "hard-working father," was revealed as the mastermind of a multi-million pound drug operation, dealing cocaine and heroin on an industrial scale. His empire was uncovered after police found incriminating WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone, joking about becoming "millionaires" or "sharing a cell." Covert surveillance captured Andrews Jr. conducting brazen drug deals, including exchanging over £100,000 in supermarket bags. He was sentenced to 14 years and eight months, with associates also receiving significant prison terms, highlighting law enforcement's success against organized crime.</p>

          <p>A new study from the CReATe Fertility Centre in Toronto indicates that cannabis use, specifically its active ingredient THC, can negatively affect female fertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Researchers found that THC disrupts the development and genetic stability of egg cells, leading to a significantly lower rate of healthy embryos in THC-positive patients undergoing IVF. While further research is needed, especially regarding dosage and age, the findings suggest that women attempting to conceive should avoid cannabis due to its potential to reduce the chances of a successful pregnancy.</p>

          <p>An explosion at the "Mis Tesoros" bar in Madrid tragically resulted in one fatality and left at least 25 individuals injured, with two in serious condition. Rescue workers recovered the body of a man during an overnight search by local firefighters and police. While authorities are still investigating the exact cause, local media reports strongly suggest a gas leak was responsible for the blast in the Puente de Vallecas district. Residents of the building, now deemed unstable, will require temporary rehousing, underscoring the severe and disruptive impact of the incident on the community.</p>

          <p>A large memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot in Utah, is scheduled for September 21 at State Farm Stadium in Arizona. His widow, Erika Kirk, delivered an impassioned speech, vowing to amplify her husband's mission and address the "evil doers" responsible. President Donald Trump is expected to attend and posthumously award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The event will celebrate Kirk's life and enduring legacy, particularly his influence on young conservatives, as the suspect, Tyler Robinson, remains in custody.</p>

          <p>Australia is investing an initial AU$12 billion ($8 billion) over a decade to upgrade its Henderson shipyard near Perth, transforming it into a maintenance hub for its future nuclear-powered submarine fleet. This substantial investment is part of the AUKUS agreement with the UK and US, aimed at countering China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. The project will create high-security dry docks and facilities for building other naval vessels, supporting around 10,000 local jobs. US President Trump's administration is currently reviewing the AUKUS pact, but Australia anticipates US access to the new facilities.</p>

          <p>Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), is holding local elections, serving as an early electoral test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's fragile coalition government. The vote will gauge the popularity of his CDU/CSU and SPD alliance, as well as the state premier. Observers are closely watching the performance of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has been classified as "right-wing extremist" and aims to capitalize on a shift towards the right in western Germany.

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, President of the UN General Assembly, has proposed deploying UN peacekeeping forces to Ukraine to secure a potential ceasefire and post-war peace, if supported by a majority of UN member states. This suggestion comes amidst stalled ceasefire talks, with Russia linking negotiations to addressing its "root causes" concerns, including Ukraine's NATO ambitions. However, any UN peacekeeping mission would require authorization from the UN Security Council, where Russia's veto power could obstruct such a deployment, making a lasting peace a distant prospect.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans, led by coach Lincoln Riley, overcame a three-hour lightning delay and their past Big Ten road struggles to defeat Purdue 33-17, remaining unbeaten. This victory marks USC's first win outside the West since 2012, exorcising "road demons" that saw them blow fourth-quarter leads last season. Defensive plays, including two crucial interceptions by Bishop Fitzgerald and Jamaal Jarrett, proved decisive, complementing an offense that found its rhythm in key moments. The team demonstrated mental resilience and physical readiness despite unusual circumstances, securing an important conference win.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have publicly accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the "one obstacle" to their loved ones' return and a peace agreement. They cite Israel's recent strike on Qatar, which targeted Hamas leaders, as evidence that Netanyahu "sabotages" deals as they approach. While Netanyahu defends the strike as removing an obstacle to ending the war, the families contend his "stalling" has cost lives and is driven by a desire to cling to power. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is visiting Israel amid these heightened tensions.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's heavy reliance on imported energy, coupled with limited storage capacity, presents a critical vulnerability in the event of a conflict with Beijing. Experts warn that a prolonged blockade could paralyze the island within days, creating a "strategic liability." The Foundation for Defense of Democracies highlights China's potential use of cyber-enabled economic warfare, maritime quarantines, and diplomatic pressure to undermine Taiwan's societal resilience and economic continuity. This article underscores the urgent need for Taiwan to address its energy security to mitigate this significant geopolitical risk.</p>
