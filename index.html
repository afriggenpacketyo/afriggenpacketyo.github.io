          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a significant surge of 40% after the company revealed impressive cloud demand figures, positioning it for its best day since 1992 and nearing a $1 trillion market cap. The company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) have increased by 359% year-over-year, reaching $455 billion, which analysts have described as astounding and historic. Oracle has benefited significantly from the artificial intelligence boom due to its cloud infrastructure and access to Nvidia's GPUs, enabling it to compete with other major cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Despite missing expectations on top and bottom lines in its fiscal first-quarter report, analysts remain optimistic, with some upgrading the stock and raising price targets, highlighting Oracle's role as a key AI enabler.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump reacted to the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, expressing concern and noting the violation. The incident prompted NATO to scramble a response, deploying Polish and Dutch fighter jets, marking the first time NATO fighters engaged potential targets in allied airspace. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski criticized Trump's peace efforts, stating that Putin laughs at them and hopes Trump will back his words with action. The U.S. Ambassador to NATO affirmed support for NATO allies and defense of NATO territory, and Trump is expected to speak with the Polish President regarding the incident.</p>

The settlement addresses lawsuits alleging Facebook improperly shared user data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, though Meta denies any wrongdoing. Payment amounts vary based on Facebook usage duration between May 2007 and December 2022, with distribution expected over the next 10 weeks. Claimants will receive an email notification approximately 3-4 days before their payment is issued, with the payments representing a portion of the settlement fund after administrative costs and lawyers' fees.</p>

While some officials express optimism for the future of U.S.-Korea ties, the South Korean president has voiced concerns, and a poll indicates widespread disappointment in South Korea over the U.S. crackdown. The incident highlights the complexities of balancing foreign investment and immigration enforcement, potentially impacting future economic relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>A UK-based antisemitism watchdog has criticized the British government's response to a rally attended by 70,000 people protesting antisemitism, citing the absence of senior government representation as disappointing. The Campaign Against Antisemitism reports a significant increase in antisemitic sentiment among the British public, with half of British Jews considering leaving the UK due to antisemitism. Concerns have also been raised about the appointment of Shabana Mahmood as Home Secretary, who has been accused of anti-Israel activism, and the UK's failure to outlaw Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The watchdog emphasizes the need for the government to stand with the Jewish community during a time of rising hatred and radicalization.</p>

The order, valued at $4.4 billion at list prices, will support Avelo's growth strategy, while Embraer, known for its regional jets, sees this as a significant win amidst competition from Airbus. The E195-E2 can seat up to 132 passengers and is expected to enhance Avelo's service network.</p>

          <p>ATM fees in the U.S. have reached a record high, with Americans now paying an average of $4.86 for out-of-network withdrawals, according to a Bankrate.com survey. The increase is attributed to banks freely charging fees without regulatory limits and making up for lost revenue as consumers shift towards digital payments. Atlanta, Phoenix, and San Diego have the highest ATM costs, while Boston and Seattle have the lowest, and financial analysts recommend strategies like getting cash back at stores or using in-network ATMs to avoid the rising charges. The survey underscores the increasing cost of accessing cash and the importance of strategic banking practices.</p>

The Utah Legislature is being forced to redraw congressional districts, potentially upsetting initiative organizers, and the Republican establishment is criticized for not engaging voters on ballot questions. Nationally, Trump's policies face legal challenges, and traditional Republicans are concerned about the economic impact of tariffs, and the article questions whether Democrats will capitalize on these shifts in the political landscape.</p>

          <h2>NASA Mars Rover Finds Potential Signs of Ancient Life</h2>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks in a dry river channel on Mars that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, though scientists emphasize the need for in-depth analysis of the sample on Earth. The rover cannot directly detect life but has gathered samples from areas considered suitable for hosting life billions of years ago, with the sample from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis showing organic carbon and chemical compounds. While non-biological processes could be responsible for the findings, lead researcher Joel Hurowitz calls it the best candidate yet in the search for potential signs of long-ago life. The mission to return the samples to Earth has been delayed due to cost concerns.</p>

          <p>The Southport inquiry heard testimony from a dance teacher who hid with a child in a toilet as the Southport knife killer banged on the door, expressing feelings of guilt and responsibility. Heidi Liddle, a mother-of-two, described the horrific events during a Taylor Swift-themed workshop where three young girls were killed and several others were wounded. She recounted her efforts to protect the children and the lasting trauma she has experienced, and Leanne Lucas, another teacher, shared her emotional impact statement, detailing the chaos and online abuse she faced. The inquiry aims to examine the killer's history and prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>

          <p>A new report accuses German state-owned KfW bank of human rights violations in its international development projects, citing forced relocations and environmental harm. The report, compiled by the Coalition for Human Rights in Development, alleges that KfW-funded projects have led to forced relocations of Indigenous communities in Indonesia, Mexico, and Kenya without adequate engagement or compensation. The coalition criticizes KfW's complaints procedure as slow and inaccessible, and calls for an independent accountability mechanism with clear human rights safeguards. KfW has disputed some of the claims, stating that it adheres to sustainability guidelines and employs specialists to manage environmental and social risks.</p>

Zara owner Inditex saw a 6% rise after posting its first-half earnings, indicating a positive trend in current trading, and investors are also monitoring potential U.S. tariffs on China and India over Russia oil purchases.</p>

          <p>The "Free DC" group is rallying against Donald Trump's intervention in Washington DC, arguing that the struggle for the city's rights is part of the larger fight for the country's democracy. Formed in response to Trump's threats of meddling, the group has galvanized residents against federal interference, particularly after the president took over the police department and sent the national guard to the city. Free DC aims to protect home rule and win lasting dignity for DC communities, with the ultimate goal of achieving DC statehood, and the group has trained thousands of people and organized protests to challenge Trump's actions.</p>

          <p>Fox News has largely avoided covering the release of documents linking President Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, including a crude doodle and a photo of Epstein holding a check signed by Trump. While other news outlets have reported on the documents, Fox News has focused on other topics, such as Bill Clinton's connection to Epstein and a deadly train stabbing in North Carolina. The released documents include a bizarre letter that appears to be written by Trump, featuring a conversation with Epstein, and the article contrasts Fox News' coverage with its approach to other stories, highlighting its efforts to downplay the Epstein connection.</p>

          <p>Tyrrell Hatton revealed that his celebration after qualifying for Europe’s Ryder Cup team involved waking up in a pool of his own vomit in an Indianapolis hotel room. The celebration with Jon Rahm included wine, gin, and cocktails, leading to Hatton having to leave cash and a note for the hotel staff. Hatton's switch to LIV had made qualification more complicated, and he described the night as aggressive and horrible, while he expressed hope for a more controlled celebration if Europe retains the Ryder Cup. He also avoided commenting on potential fan influence at the Ryder Cup in New York.</p>

Proud believes the Enhanced Games offer a new opportunity to excel and does not undermine clean sport, while Aquatics GB and UK Sport have expressed disappointment and condemnation. World Aquatics has banned athletes participating in the Enhanced Games from its events, and Proud views traditional sport and the Enhanced Games as separate entities. The Enhanced Games are planned as an annual competition with the inaugural event in Las Vegas in 2026.</p>
