          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired up to 20 agents who participated in a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., in June 2020, following the death of George Floyd. These agents, many from the FBI's Washington Field Office, were photographed kneeling during the demonstration. While some had been reassigned earlier, sources indicate a significant number have now been terminated. The FBI has declined to comment on the matter.</p>

          <h2>Trump Predicts Further Charges Against Political Adversaries Post-Comey Indictment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 21:13:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump stated he anticipates more criminal charges against individuals he considers political enemies, following the indictment of former FBI director James Comey. Trump characterized these adversaries as "corrupt radical left Democrats," intensifying concerns about a politically motivated justice system. The Comey indictment itself faced criticism for being a weak case, with a newly appointed prosecutor pursuing charges despite internal and external doubts. This move has heightened fears that Trump's appointees within the Justice Department will target other opponents, including figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Senator Adam Schiff.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Expresses Confusion Over Handling of Comey Indictment</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal magistrate judge in Virginia, Lindsey Vaala, showed confusion regarding the handling of James Comey's indictment, particularly after being presented with two inconsistent versions of the document. The grand jury had declined one of the three proposed counts, with the remaining two counts barely meeting the approval threshold. The newly appointed interim U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump personal lawyer, signed the indictment, an unusual step. This incident highlights concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department, especially following the abrupt departure of the previous U.S. Attorney who reportedly opposed charging Comey.</p>

          <p>Reports have identified the three detainees shot during a targeted attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas. Miguel Angel García-Hernandez, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, and Norlan Guzman-Fuentes were victims of the shooting by Joshua Jahn, who allegedly targeted ICE employees, not detainees. Guzman-Fuentes was fatally shot, while García-Hernandez remains in serious condition. The incident highlights the dangerous environment surrounding immigration enforcement, with the shooter dying from a self-inflicted wound after the attack.</p>

TV architect George Clarke notes a shift in mainstream architectural thought, embracing designs sensitive to local places and public preferences, moving away from past "ego-driven" brutalist structures. The goal is to create communities with high-quality homes, public spaces, and improved local services, learning from the shortcomings of post-war new towns.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared a new round of tariffs, effective October 1, targeting pharmaceutical drugs (100%), upholstered furniture (30%), kitchen cabinets (50%), and heavy trucks (30%). The pharmaceutical tariff exempts companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., aiming to incentivize domestic production. While some experts predict a modest impact on drug prices due to generics and U.S. production, these tariffs could increase costs for homebuilders and consumers. The administration asserts these measures protect domestic industries and national security, despite recent economic data suggesting tariffs are contributing to rising inflation and job losses in manufacturing.

A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had urged the declassification, citing firsthand accounts of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. Experts, however, largely dismiss the spy theory, attributing her disappearance to a fuel shortage and inadequate preparation for the challenging flight.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer provided investors with his insights for the upcoming week, highlighting the crucial nonfarm payroll report and earnings from Paychex and Nike. He expressed concern about the economy's dual nature, with some sectors overheating while others, like autos and retail, struggle. Cramer believes the Federal Reserve has managed well so far in balancing these dynamics. He also identified Carnival and Jefferies as "oddly important" companies to watch, suggesting their performance could indicate broader market trends in leisure travel and investment banking.

          <p>Famed money manager Howard Rubin and his former assistant, Jennifer Powers, have been arrested on charges of sexual assault trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts over a decade. Prosecutors alleged Rubin engaged in abusive acts, including beyond consent, causing significant injuries to women in luxury hotels and a "sex dungeon." A federal judge ordered Rubin detained without bail, citing him as a flight risk and his alleged discussion of hiring a "hitman" against women who sued him. Rubin, who pleaded not guilty, faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's public attacks on James Comey and the unusual leadership changes in the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's office could severely weaken the case against the former FBI director. Former federal prosecutors argue that Trump's years of animosity and recent comments cheering the indictment provide strong evidence for claims of selective or vindictive prosecution. The appointment of Trump's former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. Attorney, overriding career prosecutors' dissent, further fuels concerns about political interference. Such factors could lead defense lawyers to seek dismissal of the charges, highlighting a potential collapse of the traditional firewall between the White House and the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Wag Hotels, a pet hotel chain, has agreed to a $150,000 settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit alleging pet mistreatment and failure to report dog bites. The complaint, brought by district attorneys' offices, stemmed from a 2023 investigation revealing claims of inexperienced staff, insufficient training, and understaffing. Allegations included pets not being properly fed or medicated, and one incident where a dog attacked four employees. Wag Hotels stated the settlement was mutual, admitting no wrongdoing for "isolated incidents" that have since been addressed, allowing them to avoid litigation and focus on pet care.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a Black liberation activist who received political asylum in Cuba after escaping a U.S. prison in 1979, has died in Havana at 78. Born Joanne Deborah Chesimard, Shakur was convicted of murder in the 1973 killing of a New Jersey State Trooper, Werner Foerster, though she maintained her innocence. Her case became a symbol of fraught U.S.-Cuba relations, with American authorities long demanding her return. While New Jersey officials lamented that "justice was never served," Shakur's writings became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, and she was a significant figure in Black liberation history.</p>

The 400-page submission details alleged abuses by UK forces during the British Mandate (1917-1948), including murder, torture, and collective punishment. Petitioners argue that recognition alone does not address the historical injustices that continue to impact Palestinians. The Foreign Office has not confirmed ministerial awareness of the petition, but Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy is reportedly reviewing the submission.</p>

Despite past doubts, Hong Kong's stock index rise, fundraising surge, and appeal to global businesses indicate its resilience. Its position in Beijing's blueprint will significantly influence policies and resources directed its way. Experts suggest the special administrative region could strengthen its unique economic function, as its trajectory has historically been shaped by Beijing's high-level policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Supporters of California's Proposition 50, a November ballot measure to redraw congressional districts, have raised significantly more funds than opponents, with $77.5 million compared to $35.3 million. This effort, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to help Democrats gain control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Opponents, including those tied to President Trump, argue the measure is an inappropriate political power grab that bypasses a voter-approved independent commission. The special election, expected to cost $282 million, is seen as crucial for influencing national political balance in the final two years of Trump's tenure.</p>
