          <p>Kraft Heinz Foods Company has issued a recall for approximately 367,812 pounds of its Oscar Mayer fully cooked turkey bacon over concerns of potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that the affected products were produced between April and June 2025 and distributed nationwide. While no illnesses have been confirmed, listeriosis can cause serious infection, particularly for pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems. Consumers are advised to either discard the products or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

          <p>As the fall 2025 semester approaches, students and families are weighing their options between federal and private student loans. Federal loans for the upcoming academic year offer fixed rates of 6.39% for undergraduates, but private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit. While private loans can offer substantial savings, they lack the robust protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Experts suggest starting with federal loans for their accessibility and safety nets, but recommend credit-worthy borrowers compare private options to potentially secure lower overall costs.

          <p>Several House Republican holdouts who initially opposed President Trump's major legislative package stated they voted for it after receiving personal assurances from the president. Lawmakers like Rep. Ralph Norman indicated Trump promised future changes, potentially through executive action, to address their concerns, particularly regarding wind and solar tax credits. Despite these promises, no immediate changes were made to the bill's text before the vote. This highlights the significant influence President Trump wielded in pressuring party members to pass his agenda, even when their specific legislative demands were not met in the current version.</p>

          <p>Recently released FDA records indicate that senior officials appointed by the Trump administration under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overruled the agency's career scientists to restrict the approval of COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Novavax. Dr. Vinay Prasad, who replaced the former head of the vaccine regulation center, limited the shots to seniors and at-risk individuals, citing a changed risk-benefit calculation. This move has been described as a significant departure from standard procedure, where such decisions are typically made by career civil servants without political intervention. An HHS spokesperson defended the actions as principled leadership aimed at rebuilding trust in science.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright accuses former CIA Director John Brennan of manipulating the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on Russian election interference to damage Donald Trump. The article claims newly released details show Brennan pushed to include the discredited Steele dossier against the advice of senior staff, controlled the drafting process, and rushed the report's completion. Wright argues these actions were politically motivated to create the 'Trump-Russia hoax' and undermine the presidency. The author contends that this alleged weaponization of intelligence represents a profound betrayal of public trust that warrants severe consequences.</p>

          <p>An 80-year-old American novelist, Eleonor 'Gay' Courter, and her husband may face trial in France for their alleged role in selling gold bars plundered from an 18th-century shipwreck. French prosecutors have requested the case proceed, accusing the couple of helping a French diver illegally sell bullion from the 'Le Prince de Conty,' which sank in 1746. The investigation began after French authorities spotted a suspicious U.S. auction in 2018. The couple denies knowing the gold was stolen, claiming they were merely helping a friend, but investigators traced at least 23 bars to them, with 18 sold for over $192,000.</p>

The summary also revealed that Kohberger's phone pinged near the victims' home 23 times before the killings.

Experts note the legislation would make many 2017 tax cuts permanent, including raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and expanding benefits for qualified small business stock (QSBS) investments. The bill also makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent while placing new limits on the value of itemized deductions for top earners.

However, with a stable democracy and development scores above the African average, the nation is viewed as a success story, shaped by a history of resilience against poverty and drought.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted a Los Angeles activist, Alejandro Orellana, on charges of conspiracy and aiding civil disorder for handing out protective face shields to protesters. The indictment alleges Orellana distributed the shields during a demonstration against immigration raids, enabling protesters to withstand less-lethal munitions after police had declared an unlawful assembly. The U.S. Attorney, appointed by President Trump, has vowed to aggressively prosecute interference with law enforcement. Supporters of Orellana, a Marine veteran with no criminal record, call the charges ridiculous and an attack on pro-immigrant activism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has fallen significantly against the euro in 2025, a trend accelerated by President Trump's aggressive tariff policies, which have dampened investor confidence in U.S. assets. This has created a dual challenge for European manufacturers, who now face a stronger euro that makes their goods more expensive abroad and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs. Economists warn this combination will be painful for key EU export sectors like pharmaceuticals and automobiles, likely forcing price increases and a loss of market share in the U.S. The situation has intensified concerns about U.S. inflation and a potential global trade slowdown.

          <p>A 90-day suspension of President Trump's sweeping tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers. If new trade deals are not finalized with dozens of countries, steep reciprocal tariffs could automatically take effect, potentially triggering inflation and market volatility. While the administration has announced agreements with China, the U.K., and Vietnam, the status of many other negotiations remains unclear. Experts believe some extensions are likely for countries negotiating in good faith, but the prolonged threat of tariffs continues to hinder long-term business investment and planning.

The author, Sidney Blumenthal, argues that the Republican-led committee shielded Bove from questioning about his controversial past by invoking privileges to create a 'code of omerta.' The article highlights Bove's alleged history of abusive tactics as a prosecutor and his role in politically charged actions at the Department of Justice. The presence of top DOJ officials at the hearing is interpreted as an intimidation tactic to ensure Republican senators confirmed a loyalist nominee.</p>

While Roberts has occasionally defended the judiciary's independence in broad terms, Luttig argues he has avoided direct confrontation with Trump.

          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was largely powered by the public sector, which added 73,000 jobs and accounted for about half of the total nonfarm payroll growth. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, state and local governments, particularly in education, were responsible for the significant hiring surge. In contrast, the federal government continued to shrink, shedding 7,000 jobs in line with the Trump administration's focus on cutting the federal workforce. Health care and social assistance also saw strong growth, while sectors like manufacturing and professional services experienced slight contractions during the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, the American televangelist whose global ministry crumbled after two highly publicized sex scandals, has died at 90. At his peak in the 1980s, his fiery Pentecostal sermons reached 140 countries and generated a reported $150 million annually. His career imploded after he was caught with sex workers in 1988 and 1991, leading to his famous tearful on-air confession and subsequent defiance. Swaggart, a cousin of rock star Jerry Lee Lewis, built a massive following with a blend of bellowing rhetoric, gospel music, and literalist biblical interpretations before his dramatic fall from grace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite broader economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was primarily driven by the government and health care sectors, while federal employment continued to decline due to significant agency cuts. While the report is strong, economists remain cautious, expecting growth to slow in the second half of the year as the effects of U.S. trade policy and tariffs become more pronounced.

          <p>The technology IPO market showed strong signs of life in the first half of 2025, with crypto company Circle's sixfold surge since its June debut fueling optimism that a multi-year drought may be ending. After a virtual standstill since early 2022, the recent increase in public offerings is providing much-needed returns for venture capital firms. While major players like SpaceX remain private, the successful listings of companies like Circle and CoreWeave, along with the anticipated IPO of Figma, suggest the exit environment for tech startups is finally improving, though some VCs remain cautiously optimistic.
