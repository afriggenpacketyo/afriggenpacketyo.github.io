          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, has won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up the previous year.

Zaki's victory marks the 100th anniversary of the bee, and he is celebrated for his passion and enthusiasm for spelling.

Skills-based hiring is becoming more common, with companies like JP Morgan Chase and Walmart prioritizing experience over credentials.

The CDC still recommends COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and all adults for now, but it's unclear why the CDC has not updated its immunization schedule to reflect that pregnant women are now excluded from those recommended to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

          <p>A new book by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, "Original Sin," alleges that President Biden's Cabinet meetings were overly scripted due to concerns about his cognitive decline. Cabinet members described the meetings as uncomfortable and lacking genuine dialogue, with speechwriters simplifying Biden's remarks. The book also recounts an incident where Biden's performance at a meeting about Ukraine was described as a "disaster" by attendees. The authors suggest that Biden's inner circle limited his access to information and people.</p>
