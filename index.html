        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official data indicates that the UK's inflation rate has increased to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over a year, primarily driven by a rise in household bills, including water, gas, and electricity prices. The Office for National Statistics highlighted that housing, household services, transport, recreation, and culture were the largest upward contributors to this increase. The Bank of England anticipates inflation to peak at 3.7% between July and September 2025 before declining to the 2% target. The Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment with the figures, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride voiced concerns for families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is altering the focus of a grant program that provides millions of dollars to local police departments, eliminating language that previously encouraged funding for initiatives supporting underserved populations and community violence intervention. The new priorities emphasize immigration and border security, violent crime prevention, and improving the image of law enforcement. A former Justice Department attorney notes that while combating violent crime and opioid abuse are important, encouraging police to apply for funds to "uplift the image of law enforcement" is concerning, as the focus should be on building trust and cooperation within communities. Congressional Democrats have criticized the shift, emphasizing the importance of community policing efforts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that tropical deforestation reached a record high in 2024, with over 6.7 million hectares lost, an area roughly the size of Panama. Researchers attribute this surge to increased forest fires and industrial agriculture, particularly the clearing of land for cattle and commercial crops like soybeans. Elizabeth Goldman from the World Resources Institute emphasizes that these fires are not a natural part of the ecosystem and are exacerbated by rising temperatures and dry conditions. Despite global pledges to end deforestation by 2030, most major forest nations are experiencing increased forest loss, posing a significant threat to economies, jobs, and efforts to combat climate change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in Devon, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission was needed for camping. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access commons for open-air recreation, including camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the decision, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers. Campaigners are advocating for the extension of wild camping rights to other parts of England and Wales.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that its online services will remain disrupted until July following a cyber-attack last month, estimating a £300 million hit to this year's profits. The attack, believed to be orchestrated by the Scattered Spider hacking group, initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments. M&S CEO Stuart Machin stated that the company took its online system down to protect the website and customers, having spotted "suspicious activity". Cyber-security experts suggest that M&S appeared to handle the matter well, prioritizing customers and reacting relatively quickly, though it remains unconfirmed whether a ransom was paid.</p>

Some Labour MPs have expressed concerns about welfare cuts and are advocating for alternative funding methods like a wealth tax.

Mushtaq's work has made her a target of hostility, including a fatwa for advocating Muslim women's rights.

          <p>Experts suggest that Donald Trump's influence on European politics is growing, evidenced by the rise of populist movements across the continent. While the translation of Trumpism into European political languages remains incomplete, concerns over globalization, immigration, and national identity resonate in Western democracies.

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a futuristic "Golden Dome" missile defense system, aiming to counter next-generation aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles. The system, partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, would consist of next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. The program would require an initial investment of $25 billion, with a total cost of $175 billion over time. Experts warn that the system is unrealistic to complete during Trump's term, and the huge cost would consume a large chunk of the US defense budget.</p>

          <h2>Wage Garnishment Resumes for Those Behind on Student Loan Payments</h2>

          <p>Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments may face wage garnishment and other financial consequences as collections resume. Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court, provided it has given them at least 60 days notice. A lender may garnish up to 15% of disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage.</p>

          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that Russia used Brazil as a launchpad for its most elite intelligence officers, known as illegals. These spies shed their Russian pasts, started businesses, made friends, and had love affairs to build entirely new identities. Once cloaked in credible backstories, they would set off for the United States, Europe, or the Middle East and begin working in earnest. For the past three years, Brazilian counterintelligence agents have quietly and methodically hunted these spies, discovering a pattern that allowed them to identify the spies, one by one.</p>

A recent study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially causing coastal land to sink by as much as 6.5 feet. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation, scientists warn.</p>
