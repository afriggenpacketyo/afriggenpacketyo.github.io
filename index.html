            <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly criticized Peter Navarro, a top trade advisor to President Trump, amidst a continued slump in Tesla's stock price. Musk called Navarro a "moron" and "dangerously dumb" in response to Navarro's comments about Tesla being more of a car assembler than a manufacturer. This public dispute highlights the tension between Musk's business interests and the Trump administration's trade policies, particularly tariffs on imported materials and parts used in Tesla's production. Tesla's stock has declined significantly, impacting Musk's personal wealth, and the company faces increased production costs due to the tariffs.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's access to White House events after the agency was blocked due to a dispute over the term "Gulf of America."

            <p>A study by University College London revealed that three-quarters of young footballers in England suffer from gum disease, impacting their training and performance. The research found that these athletes are more likely to have tooth decay and poor oral hygiene compared to non-footballers of similar age. Factors contributing to this issue include poor hygiene habits, high consumption of sugary drinks, and stress-induced teeth grinding. The study emphasizes the need for greater education on oral health and routine dental care for young players.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to cut a $500 million grant for a key U.S. steel project in Middletown, Ohio, the hometown of JD Vance. The grant was intended to help Cleveland-Cliffs upgrade its blast furnaces to be powered by cleaner energy sources. Internal documents suggest that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, was involved in the decision. This move contradicts Trump's promises to bolster U.S. manufacturing and has drawn criticism from residents, unions, and climate advocates.</p>

She also notes that tariffs will increase costs for Apple by approximately 50%. The comments come as Apple shares are under pressure due to manufacturing exposure to China.</p>
