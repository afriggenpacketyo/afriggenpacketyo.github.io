        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's version of a major spending bill aims to codify several of former President Trump's key policies, including extending his 2017 tax cuts and introducing new temporary tax breaks. A significant change involves raising the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000, a point of contention for lawmakers in high-tax states. The bill also includes controversial cuts to Medicaid and eliminates the tax credit for electric vehicles, while removing a "revenge tax" provision that worried investors. The package reflects complex negotiations to secure support within the narrow Republican majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the case of Trump v. Casa, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to limit the power of federal trial judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which block executive branch policies across the entire country. The majority opinion argued that such broad orders exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress and were historically rare. This decision is seen as a significant victory for the executive branch, as it prevents single district judges from halting presidential agendas nationwide, thereby allowing policies to be tested in different judicial circuits. The ruling rebalances power between the judicial and executive branches.</p>

          <p>Researchers analyzing DNA from skeletons at Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, have found evidence suggesting it may have been a matrilineal society. The study of over 130 skeletons revealed that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line, indicating that men likely moved into their wives' homes after marriage. Further evidence, such as a higher quantity of grave goods buried with females, supports the theory that women held a prominent social status. This finding challenges traditional assumptions about ancient social structures being universally patrilineal.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate a rising number of immigration enforcement actions targeting the relatives of U.S. military veterans, and in some cases, veterans themselves. One recent case involved the deportation of a man born on a U.S. army base in Germany to a veteran father, despite having no other citizenship. Other incidents include the detention of a Marine veteran's father and the wife of another Marine. These cases highlight the broad scope of the Trump administration's immigration policies, which are increasingly affecting families with ties to the U.S. armed forces.</p>

          <p>A wildlife rescue charity in Somerset, England, has successfully rehabilitated and released six young peregrine falcons after an unusual influx of the birds this year. The rescues involved various challenging situations, including chicks from nests on cliffs, construction sites, and even a power station. After receiving care, the birds were returned to the wild, with some being fitted with monitoring rings to track their progress. The charity highlighted the high mortality rate for juvenile falcons and celebrated the collaborative effort to give them a second chance.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's administration. The event, which organizers estimate drew a record crowd, proceeded despite a new "child protection" law used to prohibit gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. The march was attended by Hungarian citizens, activists, and numerous European Union officials showing solidarity. The large turnout is seen as a powerful rebuke of the government's restrictive policies against the LGBTQ+ community and a broader defense of civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Following deadly anti-government protests in Kenya where police were reported to have used live ammunition, concerns are rising over press freedom in the country.

Journalists and media watchdogs report that reporters have been deliberately targeted by security forces.
