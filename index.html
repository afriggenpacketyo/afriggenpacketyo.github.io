          <p>A significant security operation is underway for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to Scotland, where he is staying at his Turnberry golf resort. The US president played a round of golf and is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has prompted protests in Edinburgh and Aberdeen and raised concerns about security costs. Roads around the resort are closed, and a large security presence, including police and military personnel, is managing the area to ensure safety during his stay.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old dog trainer, Christopher Kennedy, who had no prior symptoms, was diagnosed with terminal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis during a routine pre-surgery scan. With less than a year to live, he was initially hesitant but ultimately agreed to a double-lung transplant, a procedure his brother had not survived. After a successful surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic, his lung capacity is now at 98%. He has resumed his life and his passion for training hospital therapy dogs, viewing his experience as a profound second chance.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its establishment 72 years ago, the People's Liberation Army Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students. The ten women who were accepted achieved top scores on their university entrance exams and expressed a desire to contribute to the nation's defense. The academy, founded in 1953, is a key institution for training China's submarine personnel. This historic move marks a significant development in the roles available to women within the Chinese military, reflecting a broader shift in armed forces globally.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry, the great-granddaughter of 1930s star Will Rogers, reveals that despite being Hollywood's highest-paid actor, his true passion was being a cowboy. Rogers, who made over 70 films, saw his acting career as a means to fund his travels and ranch life, never losing touch with his Oklahoma roots. He was known for his "common man" persona, humor, and friendships with figures like Charles Lindbergh, whom he sheltered after his child's kidnapping. His death in a 1935 plane crash was a global event, remembered for the profound impact he had on bringing people together.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Israelis are choosing to refuse mandatory military service in the IDF, citing moral objections to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. These "refusers" face severe consequences, including imprisonment and social alienation, often being labeled as traitors by friends and even family. The article profiles individuals like 19-year-old Itamar Greenberg, who spent six months in a military prison for his stance. While the movement is small, it highlights a deep internal conflict within Israeli society, as these activists challenge the state's actions at great personal cost.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the media's intense focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case is diverting public attention from more critical global and national issues. The author argues that while the case has some importance, it pales in comparison to four long-term challenges: America's escalating national debt, a resurgent global hunger crisis, the demographic crisis of falling birth rates, and the degradation of U.S. military readiness. The piece suggests that these complex, less sensational stories deserve more attention as they will have far greater consequences for the future than the relitigation of a past scandal.</p>

The junta, led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, has severed ties with Western powers and aligned with military-led neighbors Mali and Burkina Faso. This shift has led to the shutdown of many NGOs, causing significant job losses and restricting civil society.

His recent fall from grace due to revelations of extreme cruelty has tainted that legacy, forcing a difficult reappraisal of a figure who once symbolized aspiration and empowerment for a generation.

          <p>Extreme summer heat, intensified by climate change, is forcing more people indoors, potentially leading to a rise in summer-pattern seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While winter SAD is linked to a lack of sunlight, summer SAD may be caused by a combination of oppressive heat and the social isolation and lack of sun exposure that comes from staying inside air-conditioned spaces. The article explores how symptoms like low energy and sadness, typically associated with winter, are now being reported by people during increasingly hot summers. This emerging mental health concern highlights another profound way climate change is impacting human well-being.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, veteran closer Kenley Jansen, now with the Angels, could potentially be traded, with his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, emerging as a possible destination. Jansen, who spent most of his career with the Dodgers, has expressed a willingness to pitch in any role for a contending team to pursue another World Series ring. With the Dodgers in need of right-handed relief pitching and the Angels unlikely to make the playoffs, a trade could be mutually beneficial. The move would mark a homecoming for Jansen, who once thought he would play his entire career in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, American comedian Krystal Evans, who lives in Scotland, shares her feelings about Donald Trump's visit. She describes how his presence is inescapable and how he, like many American tourists, desperately but unsuccessfully seeks to be embraced as Scottish. Evans contrasts Trump's persona with the rebellious spirit of the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley, who famously protested his last visit with a profane sign. The author concludes that while Trump can visit, his values are fundamentally at odds with the Scottish character, and he will never truly be accepted there.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Columbia University's recent deal with the Trump administration represents a capitulation that undermines academic independence and begins a new era of political extortion in higher education. To restore its federal research funding, Columbia agreed to pay a $200 million fine and allow a Trump-approved monitor to oversee admissions and certain academic departments. The author contends that this "backroom deal" sacrifices the university's integrity and sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting other institutions will now face similar pressure to bend to the administration's will, stifling free inquiry and dissent.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if managed carefully. Using a credit card for large wedding expenses can help couples earn significant rewards points or sign-up bonuses, which can be used for a honeymoon. However, this approach is only advisable if the couple has the savings to pay off the balance immediately to avoid high-interest debt. With the average wedding cost rising, experts stress that taking on long-term debt for a short-term event can create significant financial stress for a new marriage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The decision by CBS to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has sparked a debate about the viability of traditional late-night television. While some see it as a one-off financial decision by Paramount, others view it as a signal of the format's decline amid rising production costs and shrinking linear TV ad revenue. The article notes that while Colbert's show was a ratings leader, it still operated at a significant financial loss. The future of the genre may become clearer when Disney decides on the fate of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 25 years of trying to remove invasive smallmouth bass from an Adirondack lake, scientists made a surprising discovery: the fish evolved to outmaneuver them. A long-term study by Cornell University researchers found that the sustained removal efforts created evolutionary pressure on the bass, causing them to mature earlier and at smaller sizes. This rapid adaptation allowed their population to rebound despite the culling, demonstrating how human management can inadvertently drive swift evolutionary changes. The findings highlight the complexity of managing invasive species and the importance of long-term ecological research.</p>
