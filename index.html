The administration's request to end these protections marks a significant shift in immigration policy and raises concerns about the fate of vulnerable individuals seeking refuge in the U.S., highlighting the ongoing legal battles over immigration regulations.</p>

          <p>Pride Toronto has lost Google and Home Depot as major corporate sponsors, just weeks before the festival, due to the White House's condemnation of diversity and inclusion efforts. The sudden exit of these sponsors, following similar departures in February, poses operational challenges for the event, which attracts 3 million attendees annually. This move signals a shift in corporate support for LGBTQ+ events, as companies shy away from festivals they once loudly supported, potentially impacting the future of Pride celebrations.</p>

The new guidance means that health insurance companies will continue to be required to broadly cover the shots for now in this age group, while the agency still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children.</p>
