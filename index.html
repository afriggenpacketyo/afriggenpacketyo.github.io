          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina decided to back AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after a mere 30-minute meeting with founder Mati Staniszewski, recognizing the untapped potential in voice AI before its mainstream surge with ChatGPT. Reina, who now works for ElevenLabs, specializes in pre-seed investments, identifying highly technical founders with global visions in overlooked industries. ElevenLabs, which develops advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology, has since achieved a $3.3 billion valuation and plans for global expansion and an IPO within five years.

          <p>President Donald Trump has begun a five-day Asia tour, including stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he is scheduled for high-stakes trade talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Aboard Air Force One, Trump indicated he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019, a possibility that has generated significant speculation. The comprehensive trip aims to address ongoing trade disputes, strengthen regional alliances, and potentially de-escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered an 11-4 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays in World Series Game 1, raising questions about whether their week-long break after sweeping the NLCS contributed to "rust." Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan struggled, with Snell admitting he needed to be better regardless of the layoff. Historically, teams with long breaks after a sweep have fared poorly in the World Series, losing all four previous series. Despite manager Dave Roberts dismissing the break as an excuse, players acknowledged feeling the impact, highlighting the challenges of maintaining peak performance after an extended pause.</p>

          <p>Ethiopian national Hadush Kebatu, 41, who was jailed for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and a woman, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford instead of being transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed profound outrage, confirming Kebatu is now at large in London, prompting a multi-force police manhunt. The Prison Service has launched an investigation into the "error" and removed an officer from duties, facing widespread condemnation from political leaders across the spectrum. Kebatu was found guilty of five offenses, sentenced to 12 months, and subjected to a five-year sexual harm prevention order.</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei is encountering significant political challenges ahead of Sunday's parliamentary election, despite achieving a massive drop in inflation through radical austerity. Former party member Marcela Pagano criticized Milei's government for neglecting the middle class and vulnerable groups, alongside allegations of protecting corruption suspects. While his policies have led to a budget surplus, they have also caused widespread business closures, decreased purchasing power, and rising unemployment. Milei's popularity has dipped, with polls predicting a close race against the resurgent Peronists, indicating a crucial and uncertain test for his administration's future direction.</p>

This demolition reverses Trump's earlier promise to preserve existing infrastructure, drawing strong criticism from White House alumni and historians who view it as a disregard for the historic building. The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and expanded in 1942, served as the First Lady's office and a ceremonial entrance. The new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, privately funded by donors, is expected to resemble Trump's Mar-a-Lago ballroom and accommodate 999 people.</p>

Despite initiatives like "hero-mother" medals and financial incentives, births have plummeted, exacerbated by economic uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, and an exodus of young men. In response, Russia is implementing restrictive laws banning abortion promotion and "child-free ideology," and outlawing LGBTQ+ activism, aiming to reinforce "traditional family values." Critics argue these measures harm women's health and freedom without effectively addressing the complex demographic decline, which is further complicated by a diminished pool of potential parents.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea, coinciding with the APEC summit, is viewed by experts as a "symbolic restart" for their strained bilateral relations, despite limited expectations for immediate breakthroughs. Xi's last visit in 2014 fostered a free-trade agreement, but ties have since faced challenges. This trip is seen as a carefully calibrated step to reset the relationship, with discussions likely to touch upon Korean unification and regional stability. The engagement offers an opportunity to rebuild trust and address shared interests beyond the immediate APEC agenda.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused the US of "fabricating a new eternal war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier towards the Caribbean. This move escalates the US military presence, which Washington claims targets drug traffickers, conducting ten airstrikes that killed alleged "narco-terrorists." Maduro, a long-time foe of Trump, denies leading a drug-trafficking organization and views the military buildup as an intimidation campaign aimed at destabilizing his government. Experts suggest the goal is regime change by striking fear into the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle.</p>

Both airlines argue that terminating the venture would cause substantial financial losses and severe operational disruptions, including flight cancellations. They contend that the USDOT's action is arbitrary and capricious, holding their venture to a stricter standard than competitors, and could eliminate up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits.
