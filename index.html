          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has strongly criticized officials following a "serious accident" during the launch ceremony of a new destroyer. According to state media, the 5,000-ton destroyer lost balance at the Chongjin Shipyard, damaging its lower sections and preventing its launch. Kim Jong Un described the incident as an intolerable "criminal act" caused by carelessness, warning that those responsible will be held accountable at a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. He emphasized the immediate repair of the destroyer as a political issue directly related to the state's authority. </p>

          <p>The House Rules Committee has advanced a revised version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a megabill supporting President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, to the full House after a marathon hearing. Changes were made to several provisions, including the start date for Medicaid work requirements, which will now kick in no later than December 31, 2026. The SALT deduction rises to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000, and the "MAGA Savings Account" will now be called "Trump" Accounts. The bill also includes expedited cuts to clean energy credits and billions in border security reimbursements. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's massive tax and spending bill has cleared a procedural hurdle in the House, setting up a floor vote. The bill would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, create new breaks, end green-energy subsidies, and boost military and immigration enforcement spending. It would pay for these changes by tightening eligibility for food and health programs for low-income Americans. The bill has faced deep divisions among Republicans, with hardliners seeking more spending cuts and moderates concerned about the impact on voters in the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Ramaphosa, major political parties in South Africa and a South African judge, however, have denied the existence of a white genocide in the country. The White House released a statement after the meeting titled "President Trump is Right About What’s Happening in South Africa," doubling down on the administration's unfounded claims of genocide happening in the nation. Amid Trump and Musk's continued claims of genocide, dozens of Afrikaner refugees arrived in the U.S. last week after having their applications fast-tracked under an executive order issued by Trump in February titled "Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa."</p>

The news network, founded during the Cold War to combat Soviet propaganda, faces a financial crisis that has led to furloughs and programming cuts. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced the $6.2 million contribution, emphasizing the importance of supporting the network's independent journalism, particularly its reporting on Russia and Hungary.

          <p>The Japanese government has implemented a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease cost-of-living pressures for consumers. Under the scheme, the government will provide a fixed sum regardless of prices, targeting a 7.40 yen per liter reduction in the first week. The subsidy aims to reduce the price by at least 1 yen weekly until it is 10 yen lower by mid-June.

          <p>The Trump administration said it placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a deportation flight that lawyers alleged was destined for the violence-plagued African country of South Sudan, in its latest attempt to deport migrants to countries that are not their own. A federal judge said the government's attempted deportations "are unquestionably violative of this court's order." He noted that the detainees were put on the deportation flight less than 24 hours after being told they would be deported to South Sudan. He ordered the government to give six deportees "reasonable fear" interviews.</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups have called on the EU to take action against seven low-cost airlines over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation, BEUC accuses the airlines of "misleading" passengers and creating "confusion" and "distress" at check-ins. Passengers can pay up to €280 ($315) extra to take on a suitcase according to the consumer groups. The groups have sought an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities in EU states. They also demanded sanctions for the "illegal" practices.</p>

          <p>The People’s Liberation Army has disclosed that helicopter encounters with a foreign navy took place repeatedly over the East China Sea in which the two aircraft came as close as 10 metres from each other. The “provocations by foreign force” transpired 11 times over a period of 10 consecutive days, state broadcaster CCTV said in a report on Wednesday. The report did not specify either the time or location of the encounters, nor did it reveal the identity of the “foreign force”. As tensions in the region’s airspace and sea run high, the PLA’s air force planes and naval warships in recent years have frequently engaged in close encounters with foreign aircraft and vessels, some of which were reportedly “dangerously close”.</p>

          <p>BYU football player Jake Retzlaff is being sued for alleged battery, assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress by a Utah woman, Jane Doe A.G., who claims he committed sexual assault at his home in November 2023.

Retzlaff made the move from California to Utah in 2023 when he transferred to BYU. He led the Cougars to an 11-2 record last season.</p>

          <p>A major accident occurred during the launch ceremony of a new North Korean warship on Thursday, which Kim Jong-un denounced as a “criminal act”. Kim, who witnessed the failed launch of the 5,000-ton destroyer, declared the incident a “criminal act caused by absolute carelessness” and warned it “could not be tolerated”. South Korea’s military said the stricken warship was lying sideways in the water after the failed launch. The rare public disclosure of the accident comes after Pyongyang unveiled another 5,000-ton destroyer-class vessel named Choe Hyon last month.</p>

The Trump administration’s announcement on Wednesday that it was withdrawing from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department came as the city was preparing to mark the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of the police. Officials and residents expressed dismay about the administration’s decision, saying that oversight had been aimed at ending what federal authorities had described as a longstanding pattern of violent, racist and unconstitutional practices by the city’s Police Department.</p>

Irsay was arrested in 2014 on suspicion of driving under the influence, with police saying he had several bottles of prescription medication on him at the time. He was a recovering alcoholic and his professional successes couldn't insulate him from a constant battle with painkillers.</p>
