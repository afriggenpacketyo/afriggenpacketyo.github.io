The statue will remain in the city hall lobby until late January, aiming to attract "anime pilgrims" and boost local tourism. The campaign also includes Evangelion-themed train rides and a stamp rally across 21 locations along local railway lines, celebrating the city's connection to the popular film series and its director Hideaki Anno, who hails from nearby Ube.

            <p>According to a recent CNBC survey, President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point during his presidency, driven by widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become increasingly pessimistic about the economy's direction. The survey reveals that nearly half of Americans believe the economy will worsen in the next year, with tariffs identified as a significant source of public discontent. Despite these concerns, congressional preference remains relatively stable, with Democrats and Republicans receiving similar levels of support. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Canada is witnessing a surge in antisemitic incidents, becoming a key concern for the Jewish community ahead of the upcoming federal election. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has condemned pro-Hamas protesters and vowed to deport antisemitic foreigners, while Prime Minister Mark Carney has also denounced antisemitism. According to B'nai Brith Canada, reported cases of Jew-hatred reached a record high in 2024, with a significant increase since 2022. Israeli Ambassador to Canada Iddo Moed expressed concern over the vulnerability felt by many local Jews, urging action to combat antisemitism and ensure the safety of Jewish communities.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, citing "humanitarian" considerations, which has been met with skepticism. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy reported ongoing Russian attempts to advance, while Russia's defense ministry accused Ukraine of violating the ceasefire. Some view the truce as a PR move to improve relations with the Trump administration, while others see it as a genuine step towards peace. The brief ceasefire was declared at short notice, potentially limiting the ability of either side to fully prepare.</p>

            <p>As the UK government grapples with potential trade disruptions from President Trump's policies, the Labour Party is being urged to focus on the broader risks to global financial stability. While negotiations over tariffs continue, concerns are rising about the potential impact of deregulation in the City of London amid global financial uncertainty. Experts warn that Trump's policies could destabilize financial markets and trigger a crisis, particularly given high global debt levels and the growth of less-regulated private lending. Labour is advised to consider stricter controls on shadow banking and to recognize the wider risks to the financial system.</p>

Babiš, a billionaire oligarch dubbed the "Czech Trump," faced widespread opposition for his anti-democratic tendencies and alleged corruption. While protests alone did not force his resignation, they contributed to his electoral defeat in 2021 by uniting disparate political forces. The Czech example underscores the importance of converting popular dissent into votes and building a broad coalition to challenge authoritarian leaders.</p>

            <p>Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has dismantled democratic checks and balances, consolidated power, and controlled media and universities. Political scientists study this process to understand the erosion of democracy, noting parallels to President Trump's administration. Orban's actions included targeting media through legislation and purging unfriendly voices, pressuring universities, and consolidating power through loyalists. While some see similarities to Trump's approach, the pace and scope of the changes differ, with Trump's actions occurring more rapidly.</p>

            <p>A Texas family keeps the tradition of making cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, alive. For Denise Solis, the tradition began with her mother, Rosemary Valdez, who filled eggs with confetti even in her final weeks of life. Now, Solis carries on the tradition with her own child, Noah, carefully preparing the cascarones and hiding them in the backyard for Noah and his friends to find. The tradition connects Solis to her mother's love and care, creating a sense of joy and remembrance.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more active role in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, urging Kigali to end its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw troops from the DRC. This shift from China's usual non-interference policy is driven by its need to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries. Beijing's UN ambassador has directly asked Kigali to cease its backing of the M23 rebel group, signaling a measured change in China's approach to African conflicts.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following President Trump's new tariff regime. The company cited a "significant increase" in formal customs clearances, causing multi-day delays for shipments over $800. The White House is also set to clamp down on low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, impacting companies like Shein and Temu. These measures are aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain, but Beijing views them as unreasonable and abusive.</p>
