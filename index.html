            <h2>Honours System Should Better Recognize Contributions of Disabled Individuals</h2>

            <p>Carly Jones, an advocate for autistic women, argues that the UK honors system needs to better recognize the contributions of disabled people. Jones, herself an MBE recipient, highlights the increasing number of disabled people receiving awards, noting the current percentage is still below the proportion of disabled individuals in England and Wales. She emphasizes the importance of ensuring awards reflect those who have overcome difficult circumstances and made a significant impact helping others, not just those who donate large sums of money. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also expressed a desire for the honours system to be "properly diverse and reflective of UK society".</p>

            <p>A US court has denied the government's motion for an emergency stay and writ of mandamus in the Kilmar Ábrego García case, emphasizing the importance of due process. The court rebukes the government's assertion of a right to detain residents in foreign prisons without due process, stating this should be shocking to all Americans. The court acknowledges the Supreme Court's call for deference to the Executive Branch in foreign affairs, but asserts that the government must actively 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador. The court urges mutual respect between the branches of government, referencing President Eisenhower's enforcement of the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education II.</p>

            <p>California Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff are demanding answers from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding unannounced 'welfare checks' conducted at two Los Angeles elementary schools. The senators express outrage that federal agents attempted to speak with students without judicial warrants or prior coordination with the schools. They are seeking a briefing on the nature, scale, and objectives of these checks, raising concerns about officer training and coordination with victim services. The senators also question why DHS did not refer potential child welfare or trafficking concerns to the California Department of Social Services.</p>

Immigration lawyers claim their clients were told to sign papers in English, despite only speaking Spanish, and that deportations are imminent.

            <p>Apple's global supply chain, heavily reliant on China, is facing increased scrutiny due to rising US tariffs. While Apple secured exemptions in the past, the current administration is using the threat of tariffs to encourage businesses to manufacture in America. China has benefited greatly from hosting Apple's assembly lines, spurring local innovation and creating jobs. However, any shift in Apple's supply chain would be a significant blow to China's economy, as the company's CEO Tim Cook has stated that there is no supply chain more critical to them than China.</p>

Despite the Supreme Court backing the order to 'facilitate' his return, Trump officials are pushing back, and El Salvador's President Bukele refuses to return him. Ábrego García, who had protected legal status in Maryland, was deported despite a 2019 court order. Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Ábrego García, who was moved to a new prison with better conditions, but remains traumatized by his experience.</p>

            <p>An 11-year-old girl, Sierra Friar, provided crucial testimony in the murder of her father, Aaron Friar. Sierra awoke to yelling and breaking glass, and later saw her sister's forbidden boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, outside the house. She reported the information to detectives, leading to the discovery of Aaron Friar's body and the arrest of MacFarlane, Ellie Friar, and Russell Jones.

            <p>China's space collaboration with Latin America is under increased scrutiny as the US asserts its power in the region. The latest controversy involves the potential cancellation of an astronomical observatory project between China and a Chilean university, reportedly due to concerns conveyed by the Biden administration. Analysts expect the US to continue seeking to block such cooperation, forcing Latin American governments into a difficult balancing act between the two superpowers. It is unlikely that Latin American countries will abandon the China partnership if the US cannot provide competing alternatives.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enacting a policy that bans the use of the 'X' marker on passports and restricts changing gender markers. The judge sided with the ACLU's motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing the policy classifies passport applicants based on sex and fails to demonstrate a substantial relation to an important governmental interest. The ACLU argued the policy would effectively mean transgender, nonbinary, and intersex Americans could not get accurate passports, inviting harassment and discrimination.</p>

The government claims this action is to end the koalas' suffering, but animal welfare advocates argue that logging and development have also contributed to the problem. Experts are skeptical about shooting the animals from helicopters and advocate for rescue as the first option.

The White House stated that these workers must faithfully implement the law and the administration's policies.

            <p>The CDC has reportedly scrapped a plan to offer assistance curbing measles in Texas schools due to potential layoffs of staff involved in the agency's response to the outbreak. The agency had considered expanding a service of onsite assessments to root out ventilation errors, but the possibility of staff layoffs has halted the plan. A biomedical engineer for NIOSH, which has faced significant layoffs, stated that his team's expertise is often tapped for emergency responses. This has also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations.</p>
