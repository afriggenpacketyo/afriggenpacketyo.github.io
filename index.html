          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged their work was used without permission. The writers claimed that the company utilized pirated copies of an estimated 500,000 books to train its Claude artificial intelligence model. This agreement, considered one of the largest copyright recoveries in history, is expected to set a major precedent for how AI companies source training data and compensate creative professionals. The settlement resolves legacy claims and marks a pivotal moment in the legal battles over copyright in the age of generative AI.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is scheduled to make a significant campaign announcement, fueling speculation about his political future. The announcement follows reports that advisors to President Donald Trump are considering nominating Adams for the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Such a move could reshape the city's mayoral race, potentially altering the dynamics for other candidates like Andrew Cuomo. The context of the announcement is critical, as President Trump has expressed a desire for candidates to consolidate in order to present a stronger challenge to the Democratic front-runner, Zohran Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The technology sector experienced a massive surge, with the eight largest U.S. tech companies gaining a combined $420 billion in market capitalization in one week, reaching a total value of $21 trillion. This rally was largely driven by a favorable court ruling in Google's antitrust case, which boosted both Alphabet and Apple shares. Additionally, Broadcom's stock soared after securing a new multi-billion dollar AI customer, and Tesla's value was lifted by a proposed new pay package for CEO Elon Musk. This growth further concentrates the market, with these few companies now representing approximately 36% of the S&P 500's total value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has stated its intention to again seek the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador if his immigration case is reopened. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to a mega-prison in March, despite a 2019 court order barring his removal due to fears of persecution, before being returned to the U.S. to face separate charges. The administration maintains he is a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation his family denies. In a new court filing, the government argues that his prior grant of protection would be invalidated if the case is reopened, dismissing concerns about his treatment in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Giorgio Armani at age 91, industry experts are analyzing his profound impact on both fashion and business. Armani built a multi-billion dollar global empire by maintaining complete creative and financial control, famously never selling his company. He is credited with revolutionizing office attire with the softly tailored "power suit" for both men and women, reflecting the cultural shifts of his time.

          <p>A federally-backed crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., initiated by President Donald Trump, has resulted in 1,914 arrests since early August. Recent operations led to the arrest of 73 individuals, including an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who was on a terrorist watchlist. Other notable arrests include a confirmed gang member and individuals wanted for violent crimes like attempted murder. The operation, involving the National Guard and various federal agencies, has also led to the seizure of 198 firearms and the rescue of six missing children, which the White House is highlighting as a success in restoring law and order.</p>

          <p>Recently released employment data, showing a rise in the national unemployment rate to 4.3% and weak job creation, could signal positive news for prospective homebuyers. A cooling labor market often prompts the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates, a move that lenders have already begun to price into their mortgage offers. The weak jobs report increases the likelihood that the central bank will not only proceed with an anticipated rate cut but may consider a larger reduction than previously expected. If this occurs, mortgage and refinancing rates, which recently hit an 11-month low, could fall even further. (not investment advice)</p>

He later told authorities he had taken psychedelic mushrooms, had not slept for over 40 hours, and believed he was in a dream.

Trump argued on social media that Europe is unfairly targeting American companies like Google and Apple, effectively taking money that should be invested in the U.S. economy.

          <p>Tesla's newly released "Master Plan IV" suggests the company is pivoting its primary focus away from manufacturing electric vehicles and towards artificial intelligence, specifically robotaxis and humanoid robots. The document makes no mention of new car models, instead envisioning a future of "sustainable abundance" enabled by Tesla's AI technology. This strategic shift comes as Tesla's auto sales have slumped amid rising competition and CEO Elon Musk's controversial politics. While previous master plans successfully outlined the company's path in the EV market, this new vision bets heavily on unproven technologies like the Optimus robot and fully autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation is abandoning a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, aimed to mitigate passenger inconvenience for disruptions within an airline's control. Airlines had strongly opposed the proposal, arguing it would increase ticket prices and was overly burdensome. The department stated it will reconsider such extra-statutory requirements while still committing to implementing consumer protection mandates required by Congress, such as ticket refunds for canceled flights.</p>

          <p>A community of U.S. veterans who assist Afghan allies is expressing outrage over the arrest of former Army sergeant Bajun Mavalwalla II on federal conspiracy charges. Mavalwalla was arrested for his participation in a June protest against the Trump administration's immigration policies, which turned confrontational. Although he was not arrested at the scene, the FBI took him into custody over a month later. Fellow veterans call his arrest "shameful" and a message that peaceful dissent is being criminalized, vowing not to be intimidated as they continue their advocacy work for refugees and immigrants.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that an accountancy administrator was unfairly dismissed for spending time on personal online browsing during work hours. The judge determined that her time spent on sites like Amazon and Rightmove was not "excessive" and awarded her over £14,000 in compensation. The employer had used spyware to track her computer usage but had no formal policy against personal use, and the business owner herself engaged in similar behavior. The judge concluded the dismissal was likely motivated by a desire to remove the employee before she reached two years of service, which grants stronger unfair dismissal protections.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent court ruling against the use of troops for domestic law enforcement in California, President Trump is escalating threats to deploy the National Guard to cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans. In response, Democratic leaders in Illinois and Maryland are vehemently opposing the move and preparing for legal challenges, arguing it is an unconstitutional overreach. While crime rates in these cities are reportedly declining, the administration is framing the potential deployments as necessary for public safety and immigration enforcement. The situation is creating a tense standoff between federal and local authorities over presidential power and states' rights.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals in community-property states like Arizona, protecting an inheritance in the event of a future divorce requires careful financial separation. Inheritances and gifts are typically considered separate property, but they can become marital assets if they are commingled with joint finances. To ensure the funds remain separate, it is advisable to deposit the money into a brokerage account held solely in the recipient's name, rather than adding it to joint accounts or even some retirement funds. Contributions made to a 401(k) during a marriage, for example, are generally considered community property, which could complicate the separation of inherited assets. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Calvin McDonald stated that increased tariff rates and the removal of the de minimis exemption for smaller shipments were major factors in the guidance reduction. The company also acknowledged that its product offerings in casual categories have become "stale" and predictable, contributing to performance challenges in the U.S. market.

          <p>President Donald Trump has increased the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This reverses a key provision of his 2017 tax law, which limited the deduction to $10,000 after it had been unlimited for over a century. The SALT deduction primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who itemize their deductions. While proponents argue the higher cap reduces double taxation, critics point to its significant fiscal impact, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.

In response, West Coast states have formed a coalition to issue their own recommendations, and groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics have published separate guidelines. This schism threatens decades of vaccine synchrony and could create a patchwork of public health policies across the country.</p>

Trump has argued that the original name has a "stronger sound" and is associated with a time when the U.S. consistently won wars. The name was changed to the Department of Defense under President Truman as part of the National Security Act of 1947, which aimed to integrate the armed forces and prioritize deterring conflicts in the nuclear age. Critics worry that reverting to the old name implies a more bellicose foreign policy, while a formal change would require congressional approval and be extremely costly.</p>
