          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to End Migrant Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 12:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has effectively allowed the Trump administration to end deportation protections for approximately 500,000 immigrants who had been granted parole status after fleeing crises in their home countries. This decision reverses a lower court order that required the Department of Homeland Security to make individual determinations regarding the termination of parole status. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the Court's action was premature and failed to adequately consider the potential for irreparable harm to the affected immigrants. The ruling highlights an internal dispute within the Court regarding the use of the ‚Äúshadow docket‚Äù and its implications for expedited decisions on significant policy matters. Optimism regarding the future of these immigrants is low.</p>

          <p>The upcoming presidential runoff in Poland between Rafal Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki has intensified efforts to mobilize voters, particularly among the Polish diaspora in Germany. Many Polish voters in Germany are driven by a desire to prevent a particular candidate from winning rather than strong support for either contender. While Trzaskowski enjoys more support among Poles in Germany compared to those in Poland, right-wing candidates have also gained traction among some emigrants. The election's outcome could significantly impact Prime Minister Tusk's ability to implement reforms, making every vote crucial.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri led the second practice session at the Spanish Grand Prix, with McLaren demonstrating strong pace. The talking point of the weekend is the new front-wing flexibility test introduced by the FIA, aimed at reducing teams' ability to use flexing wings to control aerodynamic performance. Teams have long used front-wing flexibility to boost speed on straights while retaining downforce in corners, but the new restrictions are intended to limit this practice. It remains to be seen whether the tougher tests will have a significant effect on teams like McLaren and Mercedes, who are perceived to have pioneered this approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Paul Ingrassia, a former far-right podcast host, to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an agency responsible for investigating federal employees and overseeing whistleblower complaints.

His nomination is expected to face scrutiny due to his history of promoting efforts to overturn the 2020 election and ties to far-right figures. Ingrassia claims he will prioritize restoring competence and integrity to the Executive Branch and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers should consider strategies to manage high borrowing costs. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt by switching to a zero-interest balance transfer card or consolidating with a lower-rate personal loan. Locking in high-yield savings rates before they decline and improving credit scores to qualify for lower interest rates are also advised. These steps can help consumers mitigate the impact of high interest rates and improve their financial standing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In today's economy, characterized by high home equity levels and relatively low home equity borrowing rates, homeowners should carefully consider how much equity to borrow. Borrowers should assess their budget, repayment capacity, and economic outlook before deciding on an amount. It is recommended to borrow an amount that can be comfortably repaid over a shorter period to minimize interest costs. Borrowing too much equity can be risky, as the home serves as collateral and market conditions can impact repayment ability (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A ban on single-use vapes in the UK is unlikely to reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to teenagers because reusable models are very similar to disposables, according to a campaign group. While the government aims to curb youth vaping rates and reduce electronic waste, Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) argues that new reusable vapes have similar packaging and pricing to single-use vapes. The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill may address the issue by regulating packaging, design, and advertising. Some former smokers have found vaping more addictive than cigarettes.</p>
