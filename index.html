          <p>The Wales women's national football team bus was involved in a collision while en route to a training session in Switzerland ahead of their Euro 2025 qualifier against France. While all players and staff on the bus were unharmed, the driver of the other vehicle sustained minor injuries and was hospitalized. As a result of the incident, the team's scheduled training at the stadium was canceled, though they held a later session at their base. Head coach Rhian Wilkinson confirmed everyone's well-being and expressed concern for the other driver involved in the crash.</p>

The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed early Friday, overwhelming communities and prompting a major disaster declaration for Kerr County. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, involving numerous state and federal agencies, as officials face questions about the effectiveness of the warning systems in place before the catastrophic event. The disaster's scale is immense, with the governor describing the scene as "horrendously ravaged."</p>

          <p>A Florida woman, Melissa Turner, has been found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her partner, Matthew Trussler. A key piece of evidence in the trial was audio from a neighbor's security camera, which recorded a heated argument and a woman's voice yelling threats on the night of the incident. Prosecutors also used footage from an in-home ADT camera to counter Turner's claim of self-defense, arguing it showed her as the aggressor. Despite her testimony that she feared for her life, the jury convicted Turner, and she was sentenced to 20.5 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A senior economic advisor to the White House, Stephen Miran, downplayed the likelihood of President Trump's tariffs causing significant inflation, comparing the odds to rare events like pandemics or meteor strikes. Speaking on CNBC, Miran asserted that despite widespread fears, there has been no evidence of such price hikes thus far, pointing to a White House report showing a decrease in imported goods prices. Economists suggest that price increases have been delayed due to the phased implementation of the tariffs and corporate stockpiling, but many still anticipate future inflation.

The OBR's report warns that the UK's public finances are in a "vulnerable position," with rising debt exacerbated by recent government reversals on spending cuts. This long-term spending pressure, driven by an aging population and volatile inflation, places the nation's finances on an unsustainable path. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya is experiencing continued tension after deadly anti-government protests, with businesses remaining closed and new demonstrations erupting in some areas. Protesters, largely youth frustrated with economic hardship and corruption, are calling for President William Ruto's resignation and an end to police brutality. The government's response has been criticized as authoritarian, with over 560 arrests made during the recent Saba Saba Day unrest. Analysts stress the need for the government to address the citizens' grievances to find a solution and prevent further volatility and economic disruption.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has advanced to the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time in his career after a hard-fought victory over Karen Khachanov. Fritz dominated the first two sets but experienced a sudden dip in the third, allowing Khachanov to re-enter the match. After a tense fourth set that included a malfunction of the electronic line-calling system, Fritz regained his composure and secured the win in a tie-break with a final score of 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(4). He will now face either Carlos Alcaraz or Cameron Norrie for a place in the final.</p>

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Tokyo will continue negotiations to secure a mutually beneficial deal, while the European Union expressed a desire to reach an agreement quickly to remove economic uncertainty. The U.S. has threatened a 25% tariff on Japan and South Korea, with varying rates for other nations if new trade deals are not finalized.

A police search uncovered a significant cache of explosive devices, firearms, and ammunition. The arrests highlight ongoing concerns about extremism within the Canadian military and have prompted calls for increased measures to combat such ideologies within its ranks.</p>

The attack, which caused around £1 million in damage, targeted a business that was shipping aid and satellite equipment to Ukraine. The operation was orchestrated by two other men who had already pleaded guilty and admitted their connection to Wagner. This case is a significant example of a foreign state-linked entity using local proxies to carry out criminal activities on UK soil, leading to convictions under the National Security Act.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged ten people with attempted murder for their alleged role in a planned ambush of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Alvarado, Texas. The incident occurred on July 4th, when attackers allegedly used fireworks to lure agents out of a detention center before opening fire, injuring a local police officer. Authorities described the event as a violent, premeditated attack, not a protest, and recovered tactical gear and a rifle from the scene. The charges reflect an increasing trend of violence directed at law enforcement officers.</p>

The regime has barred girls from secondary education and women from many jobs, restrictions the UN has called "gender apartheid."

The treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus River network, has been a cornerstone of regional stability despite wars between the two nations. India's move, a retaliation for a militant attack, has been labeled "weaponizing water" by Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on the Indus for agriculture and power. While the immediate military risk is low, the suspension raises long-term fears of water scarcity and could disrupt the fragile peace.</p>
