          <h2>Trump-Aligned Legal Group Challenges Federal Hiring Practices Favoring Diversity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The America First Legal Foundation, a group aligned with former President Trump, has filed a federal complaint challenging the Luevano consent decree, which ended merit-based hiring practices for federal government agencies in 1981. The AFL argues that the decree promotes an unfair, race-based hiring system and seeks to restore merit-based evaluations. The lawsuit aims to dismantle what the group calls an illegal effort to promote diversity in federal hiring that sidelines more qualified candidates. This action could reignite debate over race-conscious hiring practices and impact federal agencies already struggling with personnel losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fire in a three-story building near the Charminar monument in Hyderabad, India, resulted in the deaths of at least 17 people and several injuries. The fire, believed to have been caused by a short circuit, started on the ground floor of a building that housed a jewelry store and residential space. The narrow staircase and single exit made escape difficult for the 21 people inside, and Prime Minister Modi has announced financial compensation for the victims' families. Fires are common in India due to builders and residents flouting building laws and safety norms.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study indicates a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, linked to the widespread availability of a maternal RSV vaccine and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalization rates decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have also observed that young children admitted for RSV often require lower levels of care, suggesting the preventatives are effective in reducing the severity of illness. The study underscores the significant public health impact of increased use of RSV prevention products.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary pause in Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, small businesses are advised to plan for a potential resumption of the trade war. Existing tariffs remain in place, resulting in an effective tariff rate closer to 40% on Chinese goods, which significantly impacts companies relying on materials like steel and aluminum. Trump's past actions and animosity towards China suggest that these issues will likely resurface, prompting businesses to explore alternative suppliers, bring manufacturing back to the US, or adjust pricing strategies. The article suggests the outlook is precarious and risky, and encourages businesses to plan accordingly. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike the romanticized image of bold explorers, most plant hunters were poor, ill-educated men who faced exploitation and hardship in their pursuit of exotic blooms. Letters from these hunters reveal tales of loss, disease, and abandonment, contrasting with the glamorized accounts promoted by nursery owners like Frederick Sander. The article exposes the human cost of the orchid trade, highlighting the sacrifices of expendable men who built the industry's success.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of 2,300-year-old silk books, considered the earliest known in China, have returned to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States. The Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period, were illegally excavated in 1942 and acquired by an American collector before being gifted to the museum. The repatriation follows diplomatic efforts by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China, aligning with the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy.</p>

          <p>Haas has requested a review of the decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, arguing that the lap was completed before the session was stopped due to a crash. Despite television footage and live-timing data showing Bearman crossing the line before the red flag, the FIA upheld its original decision. Bearman expressed his belief that the deletion was unfair, stating that the red light on his dash didn't appear until after he crossed the line. The FIA cited article 37.6 of the sporting regulations, stating that orange 'abort lap' lights were displayed.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have performed the first human bladder transplant, offering a potentially life-changing procedure for individuals with debilitating bladder conditions. The operation was performed on a 41-year-old man who had lost much of his bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. The doctors plan to conduct bladder transplants in four more patients as part of a clinical trial to assess outcomes and complications before pursuing a larger trial. This advance could provide a better alternative to using bowel tissue for bladder reconstruction, which often leads to complications.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay highlights the story of Desi Arnaz and his efforts to break racial barriers in early television. When CBS intended to transfer Lucille Ball’s radio show to television, Ball insisted that Arnaz, her husband, play the husband on TV. Network executives resisted because they believed the public would not accept a Latino as the spouse of an all-American girl. The couple undertook a vaudeville tour of major cities around the country, and the positive response from critics and audiences led to CBS agreeing to film a test episode. Arnaz’s differences became his greatest strengths, breaking new ground in television and making Ricky Ricardo a beloved figure.</p>
