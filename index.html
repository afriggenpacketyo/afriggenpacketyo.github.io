          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is holding its summit in Brazil, aiming to project unity and strengthen its role as a counterweight to Western institutions. However, the forum faces significant challenges, including the notable absence of China's President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, which provides India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi an opportunity to take a more central role. The article explores the group's internal divisions, such as geopolitical tensions between India and China and the difficulty in achieving consensus on major global issues. Despite ambitions like the New Development Bank, the bloc struggles to translate its collective economic weight into cohesive political action.</p>

          <p>After 42 years, a 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been indicted for the murder of his former girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, who disappeared in Oregon in 1983. The breakthrough came after investigators reopened the cold case last year and utilized new DNA technology. A human skull found in 1997 near the site of Peroni's disappearance was definitively identified as hers through this advanced testing. Sanfratello, who was the last person seen with Peroni, has been detained in California and is awaiting extradition to face the charges in Josephine County.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the passage of President Trump's major legislative package, both Republican and Democratic parties have launched campaigns to shape public opinion. Republicans are highlighting the bill's tax cuts, increased defense spending, and border security funding as promises kept to their voters. Conversely, Democrats are focusing on the significant cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, citing Congressional Budget Office estimates of millions losing coverage and a rising national deficit. The political battle reflects deep partisan divisions over the bill's long-term impact on American families and the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Partey, a 32-year-old former midfielder for Arsenal, has been formally charged with five counts of sexual assault against three different women. The alleged offenses took place between 2021 and 2022, with the investigation beginning after a report was first made to police in February 2022. The charges include multiple counts related to two of the women and a single count for the third. Partey, whose contract with Arsenal recently ended, is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in August to face the allegations.</p>

          <p>In response to recent US and Israeli airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran has announced it will suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This move escalates tensions and raises questions about the future of international oversight of Tehran's nuclear activities, which include enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. The article provides historical context, from the US-backed origins of the program in the 1950s to the 2018 collapse of the JCPOA deal. Experts warn that the attacks could push Iran to pursue nuclear weapons for self-defense, viewing it as a deterrent against further aggression.</p>

The article details the significant legal and logistical hurdles Musk would face, including navigating 50 different state laws for ballot access and intense opposition from the established Democratic and Republican parties. While Musk's immense wealth could fund such an effort, experts note that creating a nationally viable third party is a complex, multi-year project that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <h2>EU and Germany Propose New Global Trade Organization to Counter WTO Gridlock</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz have proposed that the EU lead the formation of an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The move is a response to the long-standing paralysis of the WTO's dispute resolution body, which has been blocked by successive US administrations. The new organization would aim to liberalize trade among like-minded nations, potentially partnering with the CPTPP trade bloc in Asia, and would exclude countries that do not adhere to fair competition rules. This signals a strategic shift to bypass US protectionism and address market distortions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton achieved his best practice result of the season by setting the fastest time during the first practice session for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. He narrowly edged out McLaren's Lando Norris by just 0.023 seconds in a competitive showing. The session saw strong performances from McLaren, with championship leader Oscar Piastri finishing third, followed by Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari. This result provides an encouraging start to the weekend for Hamilton at his home race, signaling potential competitiveness for the main event.</p>

          <p>A 90-day pause on extensive US tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant uncertainty for the US economy and global trade. If new bilateral trade deals are not finalized, sharply higher import duties will automatically take effect on goods from dozens of countries. While the Trump administration has announced deals with nations like China and the U.K., the status of many others remains unknown. Economists warn that the implementation of these "Liberation Day" tariffs could reignite inflation, harm businesses reliant on imports, and negatively impact financial markets.

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed a collection of "unusually large" 2,000-year-old shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site in England. Several of the leather shoes are equivalent to a modern US size 15, a size that is exceptionally rare in the vast collection of artifacts from the region. The discovery was made in a defensive ditch, which Romans often used for discarding rubbish, providing excellent preservation conditions. Researchers are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at the fort to understand why so many large-footed individuals were present at this specific site.</p>

          <p>A jury has heard that a widely filmed brawl at Manchester Airport last year, involving two brothers and three police officers, was preceded by an assault at a Starbucks cafe. Prosecutors allege that Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad used a "high level of violence" when police attempted to arrest one of them in the terminal. The confrontation allegedly resulted in injuries to the officers, including a broken nose for one. The brothers, who deny the charges, claim they were acting in self-defense, but the prosecution asserts that CCTV footage will clearly show their conduct was unlawful.</p>

          <h2>Fourth of July Celebrations Face Contradictions Amid Perceived Decline in American Democracy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:00:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that celebrating American freedom on the Fourth of July feels hollow this year due to a perceived backslide in democracy and the rule of law. It draws a parallel between the historical hypocrisy of celebrating liberty while slavery existed, as noted by Frederick Douglass, and the current erosion of civil rights and the stoking of racial division. The authors contend that despite this challenging political climate, hope lies in grassroots action and community organizing. They urge citizens to actively engage in building a more equitable democracy from the ground up, rather than succumbing to despair.</p>

          <h2>Advocates Race to Secure Passports for US-Born Children of Haitian Immigrants Facing Deportation</h2>

          <p>Community volunteers and legal advocates in Springfield, Ohio, are in a desperate race against time to secure US passports for thousands of American-born children of Haitian parents. This effort comes as the Trump administration threatens to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, which could lead to their deportation. Without passports, these US-citizen children could become stateless or be separated from their families if their parents are forced to leave the country. The situation highlights the profound fear and uncertainty within the Haitian community as they navigate a precarious legal landscape.</p>
