        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has publicly suggested the possibility of forming a new political party in the United States, potentially intensifying his ongoing dispute with President Trump. Musk initiated the idea by posting a poll on X, asking his followers if they believed it was time for a new party representing the "80% in the middle." He later endorsed the name "America Party," reminiscent of his political action committee, America PAC, which spent millions to support Trump's 2024 election. While the feasibility of starting a new party remains uncertain, this move indicates Musk's continued engagement in politics and potential challenge to Trump's influence.</p>

          <p>Multiple immigration enforcement operations across Los Angeles led to the arrest of dozens, prompting widespread protests. Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI conducted raids in areas including the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., resulting in approximately 44 arrests according to ICE. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell clarified that the LAPD was not involved in civil immigration enforcement, aiming to ease anxiety among residents. Mayor Karen Bass condemned the operations, stating they sow terror in communities, while Senator Alex Padilla criticized the actions as cruel and harmful, reflecting the deep divisions surrounding immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a, a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He is accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country. El Salvador agreed to release Mr. √Åbrego Garc√≠a after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, Attorney General Pam Bondi said. His lawyer has called the charges "preposterous," and the White House had previously resisted a US Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.</p>

Prosecutors have charged Mr. Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he pleaded not guilty.

          <p>The UK government is finding it difficult to decrease the amount of foreign aid allocated to cover hotel expenses for asylum seekers in the country. Despite efforts to reduce these costs, the Home Office plans to spend ¬£2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only slightly less than the ¬£2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. This funding is primarily used for accommodating asylum seekers, leading to significant cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development projects worldwide. Critics argue that the Home Office lacks incentive to reduce ODA spending, as the money does not come from its own budget.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported back to his home country, has been returned to the U.S. to face two federal criminal counts that were detailed in an indictment unsealed on Friday. The filing alleges that between 2016 and 2025, Abrego Garcia and others conspired to bring migrants from Latin American countries to the U.S., passing through Mexico before crossing the southern border into Texas. The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia and six co-conspirators used cellphones and social media platforms to move migrants into and throughout the U.S.</p>

In April, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year. Protests, dubbed #TeslaTakedown, have played out across the country every weekend since Trump took office. Could Musk's high-profile falling out with Trump help rehabilitate him in the eyes of people who turned against him because of his previous closeness to the president?</p>

The administration's xenophobic stance is not accidental but rather a deliberate policy, driven by ideologies that seek to limit both legal and illegal immigration.

          <p>En el lapso de 15 minutos agentes federales llegaron y arrestaron a varios jornaleros en la ferreter√≠a Home Depot, ubicada en la esquina del bulevar Wilshire y la calle Union, en Los √Ångeles. Al ver a los agentes, Abraham les grit√≥ a sus compa√±eros jornaleros. Al ver que no le hac√≠an caso, volvi√≥ a insistir. Estos jornaleros llegan a las 5 de la ma√±ana a este lugar cada d√≠a en busca de trabajo. Sus ingresos dependen de las personas que los contratan al momento de comprar materiales de construcci√≥n y jardiner√≠a en la tienda Home Depot. Poco despu√©s de la redada en este lugar se report√≥ otro operativo en el Distrito de la Moda, en el centro de Los √Ångeles.</p>
