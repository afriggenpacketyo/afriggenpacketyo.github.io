          <p>In the aftermath of a deadly mass shooting at a Michigan Latter-day Saints church, a fundraiser has been organized for the family of the accused shooter, Thomas Jacob Sanford. The organizer, citing religious teachings on compassion, highlighted that Sanford's wife and children are also victims of the tragedy, with one son having serious medical needs. The effort, hosted on GiveSendGo, has raised over $334,000, with many donors appearing to be members of the LDS church expressing forgiveness and support for the grieving family.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy has terminated nearly $8 billion in funding for over 300 clean energy and infrastructure projects, primarily located in states won by the Democratic party in the 2024 election. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and state officials, have condemned the move as a politically motivated act that will cost jobs and hinder progress on climate goals. The Trump administration defended the cuts, stating the projects were not economically viable and were rushed through by the previous administration, a claim disputed by project advocates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New findings from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that mothers in England experience a substantial and prolonged reduction in their earnings after having children. The data indicates that five years after their first child, a mother's monthly earnings are, on average, over £1,000 lower than before childbirth, a phenomenon known as the "motherhood penalty." Campaign groups attribute this gap to factors like unaffordable childcare, an unbalanced parental leave system, and maternity discrimination, calling the situation both unfair and avoidable.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn a return that can outpace the inflation rate. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, many online banks are offering highly competitive rates, with some short-term CDs yielding over 4.40% APY. Financial experts suggest that savers consider laddering CDs of various terms to balance long-term goals with the currently higher rates available on short-term accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the migrant neighborhoods of Monterrey, Mexico, a unique musical subculture known as "Kolombia" has thrived for decades, centered around "sonideros," or cumbia DJs. This movement, born from a longing for rural life, even accidentally created its own genre, "cumbia rebajada," a slowed-down version of the Colombian original. Despite periods of intense cartel violence that forced the scene indoors, the cumbia parties have returned to the streets, representing a resilient cultural identity for the community.</p>

The legislation is part of a broader effort to eliminate non-essential uses of the toxic compounds, which are linked to serious health problems. Industry groups are lobbying heavily against the ban, claiming it will harm restaurants and unfairly target their products, while public health advocates urge Newsom to sign the bill to reduce public exposure.</p>
