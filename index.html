        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Conservative Party, led by Kemi Badenoch, plans to remove all net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea if elected. This policy shift aims to prioritize maximizing extraction of domestic fossil fuels, arguing that current climate obligations burden the economy and leave vital resources untapped. The move marks a significant departure from previous government commitments to achieve net-zero by 2050 and contrasts with the Labour government's stance against new exploration licenses. Critics warn that such a policy would accelerate the climate crisis and not significantly reduce energy bills.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has voiced skepticism regarding the feasibility of a direct one-on-one meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as he had previously suggested. Instead, Trump believes a three-way discussion involving himself would be more likely to occur. This comes amidst Ukraine's frustration with Russia's perceived lack of constructive engagement in peace negotiations, while Russian forces continue their offensive along the front lines, seizing more territory. The ongoing conflict underscores the complex diplomatic challenges in achieving a peace settlement.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order, the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," in anticipation of a possible deployment of federal agents to the city for immigration enforcement. The order aims to safeguard residents' rights, prohibiting city police from collaborating with federal authorities on immigration patrols and requiring agents to wear identifying badges and avoid masks. Johnson criticized the federal government's actions as potentially unconstitutional, while the White House maintained the deployment would address crime. This move highlights escalating tensions between local and federal authorities over immigration and public safety policies.</p>

          <p>The United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA) and other government-funded international broadcasters, is implementing a reduction in force, eliminating over 500 full-time federal positions. This decision follows President Trump's directive to scale down VOA and reduce federal bureaucracy, despite a federal judge's recent order blocking the removal of VOA's director and demanding compliance with previous rulings. Employees and their legal team have condemned the layoffs, viewing them as continued attacks on the agency's mission to project America's voice abroad. The move intensifies an ongoing legal and political battle over the future of these vital international news networks.</p>

His career spanned eight presidential administrations, and he successfully reinvented himself as a prolific Twitter (now X) user in his later years.

          <p>The Stringfellow family, a showpeople family who have lived on Water Row in Govan, near Glasgow, for over 40 years, is facing eviction by Glasgow City Council to make way for a new development. Jimmy Stringfellow, 76, and his family, including his daughter and five-year-old granddaughter, are taking their case to Scotland's highest court, arguing their rights to a secure home are being violated. Their legal team, Just Right Scotland, will contend that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has not been considered, potentially setting a legal precedent. The council asserts the family has no right to occupy the land, while the family maintains the offered alternative sites are unsuitable for their cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in drinking habits, with overall beer sales reaching their lowest point in over 30 years, falling by 6.3% in the first half of 2025. In contrast, sales of non-alcoholic beer have more than doubled since 2013, indicating a growing preference among younger, more health-conscious consumers. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting alcohol-free options at sporting events as a natural alternative to energy drinks. While full-strength beer remains a strong cultural fixture, particularly at traditional festivals, the trend suggests a conscious move towards moderation.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are frequently subjected to abuse and intimidation from other road users, causing significant anxiety and affecting their confidence. Instructors report daily incidents, leading many to install dashcams to record aggressive behaviors like tailgating, horn-beeping, and shouting. Police forces are taking action, with a high percentage of dashcam submissions leading to warnings or vehicle impoundments. This concerning trend highlights a lack of empathy on the roads, prompting calls for greater consideration towards those who are still learning.</p>

Contestants praise the show's authenticity, stripping away superficiality and focusing on genuine connection through shared adversity. The program also features slightly older contestants, reflecting a trend of people settling down later and seeking deeper relationships beyond typical dating app experiences.</p>

Tinsley burned a woman's clothes, and moments later, a fire erupted in the building, leading to the evacuation of 24 units and significant damage. Initial aggravated arson charges were reduced after an investigation revealed structural issues with the building's fireplaces contributed to the fire's spread, and there was no evidence Tinsley received a warning against using them.

The beetle, which has ravaged European spruce trees, was found to be arriving in the UK via wind currents, not just imported wood. By deploying drones for aerial surveys and training dogs to detect beetle pheromones and frass, the UK has become the first country to eradicate the Ips typographus from its controlled at-risk areas.

While a full resolution is unlikely, the leaders may seek "soft wins" like resuming direct flights and relaxing visa restrictions. This move signals a potential shift towards multipolar alliances and a clear message to Washington that India is exploring alternative economic and political partnerships (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's highly anticipated Netflix adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature. Del Toro, known for his monster-humanizing films, has pursued this project for decades, aiming for a grand scale and a nuanced exploration of what it means to be human. The film, which is split into three parts, emphasizes practical effects over CGI and delves into both Frankenstein's motivations and the creature's perspective. Early reviews are mixed but largely acknowledge its ambition and artistic merit.</p>

          <p>Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for telling opponent Taylor Townsend she had "no education" following their US Open second-round match. The incident stemmed from Ostapenko's perception of poor tennis etiquette after Townsend did not apologize for a net cord. While Townsend did not interpret the comments as racially motivated, former world number one Naomi Osaka noted the historical sensitivity of such remarks towards Black tennis players. Ostapenko clarified that English is not her native language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, expressing regret for any offense caused.</p>

Councillors deemed the chimes an integral part of the town's "character," a sentiment echoed by some residents.

          <p>New evidence suggests that legendary Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, whose story inspired the movie "Walking Tall," was involved in his wife Pauline's 1967 murder, long believed to be an ambush meant for him. A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report found inconsistencies in Pusser's statements and physical, forensic, and ballistic evidence contradicted his account. Investigators now believe Pauline was shot outside the vehicle and then placed inside, and Pusser's own gunshot wound may have been self-inflicted. This re-investigation, using modern forensic science, aims to bring dignity and closure to Pauline's family decades later.</p>

Carpenter, now 26, continues to collaborate with Jack Antonoff and others, crafting a sound that blends '70s pop, country, and dance music.

          <p>Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decisions continue to spark controversy in the Premier League, with Burnley manager Scott Parker lamenting that VAR is making football "the most sterile game there is."

Similar disputes arose in Chelsea's match against Fulham, with managers expressing frustration over the perceived over-scrutiny of every moment. Critics argue that VAR is detracting from the enjoyment of the game and advocate for former players to be involved in the review process to better understand on-field dynamics.</p>
