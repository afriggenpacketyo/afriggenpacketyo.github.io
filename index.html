          <p>A bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, killing one person and damaging several buildings across the city's downtown area. The explosion, which occurred near American Reproductive Centers, appears to be an isolated act of violence. The clinic reported that none of its staff were harmed, and the eggs, embryos, and other materials in its lab remained secure. The FBI and ATF are assisting with the investigation to determine the cause and whether the clinic was the intended target, especially amidst the politicization of in vitro fertilization in reproductive rights debates.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are holding their first bilateral summit since Brexit, aiming to reset relations amidst global concerns like Russia, China, and US defense priorities. Negotiations continue over key issues such as fishing rights and defence contracts, with expected announcements including a joint declaration on foreign policy priorities, a security and defence pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While these trade measures represent a modest reset promised by Prime Minister Starmer, they are limited by Labour's red lines against rejoining the customs union or single market. The UK is also seeking to reduce trade barriers sector-by-sector, such as with a plant and animal health deal, while the EU insists on long-term fishing rights in UK waters.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine but restricted its use to older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions, a decision that has sparked controversy. This restriction limits access for healthy individuals under 65 and requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, potentially costing the company millions. Experts express concern that these restrictions, influenced by vaccine skepticism, may hinder vaccine availability and accessibility. Some argue that the decision deviates from established norms, as the CDC typically determines vaccine recommendations, raising questions about the future of vaccine infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Hamas has proposed releasing more hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce with Israel, following new negotiations mediated by Qatar and the US. The proposal includes the release of nine hostages and the entry of 400 aid trucks daily into Gaza. This comes as Israel launched a new offensive, 'Operation Gideon's Chariots,' resulting in numerous casualties in Gaza. Aid agencies warn of a worsening humanitarian situation and risk of famine due to the Israeli blockade, while international bodies call for a permanent ceasefire.</p>

          <p>China is investing heavily in the digitalization of its museums and cultural heritage to engage new generations and strengthen national pride. Advanced technologies, like 3D scanning and AI, are being used to bring ancient history to life, as exemplified by the digital Tangut princess in Zhangye. This push for digitalization is part of Beijing's broader strategy to become a 'cultural superpower,' despite facing economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. The focus on preserving history and promoting technological progress contrasts with budget cuts in cultural sectors in many Western countries.</p>
