          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced his reelection bid as an independent candidate, bypassing the Democratic primary.  This decision follows the dismissal of his federal corruption case.  His strategy is to appeal directly to all New Yorkers, utilizing his incumbency, rather than face a potentially difficult primary challenge.  Political experts are divided on the viability of this unconventional approach.</p>
