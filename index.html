          <h2>Astronomers Witness Earliest Stages of Rocky Planet Formation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have for the first time directly observed the initial stages of rocky planet formation around a newborn, sun-like star named HOPS-315. The discovery provides a rare glimpse into the processes that likely formed Earth and our solar system over 4.5 billion years ago. Researchers detected silicate minerals, the very building blocks of terrestrial worlds, condensing in the star's hot inner gas disk. This finding suggests that the conditions for creating Earth-like planets may be a common occurrence, offering a significant breakthrough in understanding planetary origins.</p>

          <p>Days of severe torrential rain across South Korea have resulted in at least 14 deaths and left a dozen people missing due to widespread flooding and landslides. The country's disaster management office is coordinating ongoing emergency rescue efforts, with fears that the death toll could increase as more reports come in. Thousands of homes and roads have been damaged or submerged, leading to nearly 10,000 evacuations and significant power outages across multiple regions. The government has ordered the worst-hit areas to be designated as special disaster zones to expedite recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The mother of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern fatally shot in Washington, D.C., is urging police to find those responsible for her son's death. Tarpinian-Jachym was an unintended victim in a shooting where several individuals fired into a crowd just a mile from the White House. His mother, Tamara Jachym, expressed her grief and warned that the perpetrators will strike again if not apprehended, highlighting the rising homicide rate in the city. The FBI has joined the Metropolitan Police Department in the investigation, but no suspects are currently in custody.</p>

          <p>In response to a looming 30% U.S. tariff, South Africa is actively working to increase its exports to China and address a significant trade imbalance favoring Beijing. A high-level South African delegation visited China to promote investment and diversify exports beyond raw commodities to higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals and green energy tech. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to overcome market access barriers and establish a more balanced trade relationship. Observers note that while China is a crucial alternative market, it presents its own complexities and risks of over-dependence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030, marking the first time a clear target has been set on the issue.

The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution to protect wildlife. While critics note the pledge is not legally binding, it signals a government response to scrutiny over water companies' environmental performance and executive bonuses amid rising consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Following the resolution of a trade dispute, China's exports of rare earth magnets to the United States surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month. The flow of these critical minerals, essential for electric vehicles and wind turbines, had been severely restricted after China added them to an export control list in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. The sharp decline in April and May disrupted global supply chains, but the June recovery indicates a normalization of trade. Total global exports of the magnets from China also increased significantly, though they remain below last year's levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall argues that the relentless nature of modern conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from a global crisis of morality. He posits that the world is ethically fractured, lacking a "permanent moral order" or universally accepted principles, which makes peaceful resolutions nearly impossible. This moral relativism allows atrocities to continue, as what is indefensible to one group is justified by another for political or social reasons. This article concludes that ending these conflicts requires a collective recommitment to shared ethical standards as defined by international law and social contracts.</p>

          <h2>United States to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Most Visitors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government will soon require visitors needing nonimmigrant visas to pay a new, additional "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This fee, part of a recently enacted law, applies to tourists, business travelers, and students and is charged on top of existing visa application costs. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if the visitor complies with all visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, implementation details remain unclear, and due to the expected complexity of the refund process, experts advise travelers to treat the fee as nonrefundable. (not investment advice)</p>
