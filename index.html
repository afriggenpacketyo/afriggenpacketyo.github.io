Giuffre was a vocal accuser of Epstein and Prince Andrew, alleging sexual assault when she was a minor, with Prince Andrew denying these accusations and settling out of court. Her lawyer and representative described her as a champion for other victims and a beacon to survivors, with her legacy being one of courage and a loving spirit.</p>

While formal meetings are unlikely out of respect, diplomats anticipate "brush-by" conversations on the sidelines, especially concerning the Ukraine conflict.

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against various media outlets, including banning reporters and attempting to defund publicly funded broadcasters, have raised concerns about press freedom in the United States. Despite constitutional protections, legal battles have ensued, highlighting the need for active defense of the First Amendment. Experts caution that intimidation tactics targeting law firms willing to challenge the administration could further erode free speech protections, creating an environment ripe for misinformation and undermining democratic stability.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' as biological. The guidance states that transgender women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals and shops, and vice versa for transgender men, ensuring that trans people are not left without any facilities. The EHRC emphasizes that identifying as trans does not change a person's biological sex under the Equality Act, and a consultation will be launched to gather views before updating the code of practice.</p>

          <p>LeBron James scored a historic 38 points, the most ever by a player over 40 in a playoff game, but it wasn't enough to lift the Lakers over the Timberwolves in Game 3. The Lakers committed 19 turnovers and struggled to contain Jaden McDaniels, ultimately losing 116-104 and falling behind 2-1 in the series. With Luka Doncic ailing, the Lakers' mistakes proved too costly, putting their season in jeopardy.</p>
