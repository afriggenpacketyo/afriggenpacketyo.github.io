          <p>Candidates for California's 2026 gubernatorial race are outlining their platforms, offering both praise and criticism for Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure. Democrats like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra highlighted Newsom's economic management and resistance to the Trump administration, while proposing faster action on housing and infrastructure. Republicans such as Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton criticized Newsom's policies, with Hilton agreeing only on limiting smartphone use in schools. The diverse field, including candidates from the Green Party, is focusing on key state issues like healthcare, housing costs, and fiscal accountability, setting the stage for a competitive election.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described as a "political assassination," has drawn widespread condemnation. Investigators tracked Robinson using security footage and found a high-powered rifle believed to be the murder weapon, along with bullet casings bearing politically charged inscriptions. Robinson, who reportedly confessed in messages on Discord, was identified after his father recognized him in police photos and urged him to surrender, providing a major break in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>During a press briefing, President Trump initially claimed he was "not familiar" with the assassination of Minnesota's Democratic House Speaker, Melissa Hortman, when asked why he hadn't lowered flags for her as he did for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. When pressed, Trump stated he would have considered it if the governor had made a request, despite having previously called a potential conversation with Minnesota's governor a "waste of time." The exchange highlighted criticism that the administration is selectively grieving political violence, focusing on attacks against allies while largely ignoring those targeting Democrats and fueling accusations of hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>A group of young people in Pensacola, Florida, gathered to restore a mural honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk after it was vandalized with hateful messages. The original tribute was defaced with phrases like "a good Nazi is a dead Nazi" following a community vigil. In response, supporters covered the vandalism with spray paint, adding Bible verses and encouraging notes to transform the space back into a positive memorial. Participants stated their goal was to counter the disrespect and evil with messages of faith and hope, reflecting Kirk's emphasis on open debate over silencing opposition.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index reached a historic milestone, closing above the 45,000 mark for the first time and leading gains across Asia-Pacific markets. The surge was reportedly fueled by investor optimism following President Trump's positive comments on U.S.-China trade negotiations and a framework deal concerning the divestment of TikTok. Other major indexes, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the U.S. S&P 500, also saw gains, reflecting a broad-based confidence in the market ahead of a key U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.

          <p>The sustained lead of Reform UK in opinion polls is causing significant concern for Britain's established political parties. For the Labour government, the last few weeks have been marked by self-admitted mistakes and internal factionalism, amplified by the fear of ceding ground to a party they deeply oppose. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party is facing an existential crisis as it continues to lose defectors to Nigel Farage's populist movement. This shifting political landscape is forcing both major parties to confront difficult questions about their leadership, direction, and ability to regain public trust ahead of their annual conferences.</p>

However, some key procurements, such as the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon and the F-16V fighter jets, have faced substantial delays due to production and testing issues.

Medical experts warn that exposure can lead to neurological problems, and flight attendant unions have long raised alarms about the issue.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled to prevent President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to participate in an upcoming key interest rate vote. The divided court upheld a lower court's decision, finding that her removal would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to ensure the central bank's political independence. The Trump administration sought to remove Cook based on unproven mortgage fraud allegations, a move critics see as part of a broader effort to exert political control over the Fed's monetary policy. This legal battle underscores the ongoing tensions between the White House and the independent central bank.</p>

Ronson explains how navigating delicate situations in clubs later helped his work as a producer, such as when he calmly defused the tension after Lady Gaga accidentally crashed into his car before a recording session. His book focuses on this formative period, which predates his mainstream success with artists like Amy Winehouse and Bruno Mars.</p>

The contamination, believed to be from incinerated lead-based paint from older homes, was not fully removed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' cleanup efforts. High levels of lead were found not only on destroyed properties but also in the yards of homes that are still standing, both inside and outside the burn scar.

His appointment is seen as a victory for President Trump, who has been publicly pressuring the Fed to implement substantial rate cuts.

          <p>As autumn begins, many people feel motivated to tidy their homes, a process that psychologists say can reduce stress and increase energy. Experts recommend four main strategies for successful decluttering: start small with a single drawer, plan ahead where to donate or sell items, and prioritize keeping quality objects that bring joy rather than a large quantity of things. A crucial tip is to distinguish between sentimentality for an object and nostalgia for the past it represents, which can make it easier to let go. This mindful approach helps make the task manageable and prevents feeling overwhelmed.</p>

Many doctors argue these warnings are based on flawed, decades-old research that focused on older women and overstated the dangers for those who start treatment around the onset of menopause. More recent studies suggest that for many women, the therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms like hot flashes, and risks can be mitigated based on age and dosage. However, some experts urge caution, calling for more scientific assessment before any label changes are made.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military has conducted a second strike in international waters on a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three individuals described as "terrorists." The announcement, made on social media, included a warning to drug traffickers and was followed by comments from Trump stating there was proof of narcotics on board. This action occurs amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela, with the Trump administration accusing President Nicolás Maduro's government of collaborating with drug cartels. The U.S. has recently increased its military presence in the Caribbean region.</p>

While framed as a promotional event to grow the game, it also represents a major business venture for sponsor Fanatics, which has received investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, highlighting the increasing intersection of sports, global marketing, and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the United Kingdom is fraught with potential diplomatic pitfalls, despite meticulous planning by royal and government officials. The visit, his second as president, is expected to draw large protests and is shadowed by the recent dismissal of the UK ambassador to the US, Lord Mandelson, over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. While the UK government hopes to secure economic deals and strengthen the "special relationship," the visit's brevity and the stark policy differences between the two administrations on issues like the Middle East create a high-risk environment where optics and political theater are paramount.</p>

He argued that these companies continue to be strong investments due to their great management, vast cash reserves, and enormous scale, which makes them difficult for competitors to challenge. Citing examples of innovation like Apple Watch's new health features and Meta's successful acquisitions, Cramer suggested that these giants are constantly evolving. He believes that as long as their core strengths remain, their valuations are compelling and their growth potential is still significant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A survey by Alzheimer’s Research UK has revealed significant failings in the NHS dementia diagnosis process, with healthcare staff and carers describing it as slow, unequal, and inadequate. Nearly a quarter of dementia service workers feel they cannot provide the best care, and fewer than a third believe the current diagnostic system is fit for purpose. The survey also found that over a fifth of families waited more than two years for a diagnosis after first consulting a GP. The charity warns that the system is not keeping pace with the growing challenge, as nearly one million people in the UK live with dementia.</p>

In an interview with Sky News, Zelenskyy expressed frustration with the West's current approach, stating that Vladimir Putin only understands the language of force. He urged Trump to provide more air defense systems and impose a strong package of U.S. sanctions on Russia's economy, arguing that the U.S. is powerful enough to act decisively without waiting for European partners. Zelenskyy believes direct pressure from Trump is necessary to make Putin afraid and bring a halt to the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports, an idea the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now reportedly reviewing. Trump argued the change would save companies money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, contrasting the U.S. system with what he described as China's longer-term view. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized the focus on quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors. The proposed change could be implemented by the SEC without congressional approval. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that as global dynamics shift, China has a unique moment to rewire international trade and development.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" for a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., avoiding a potential ban. The app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has faced scrutiny over concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or use the platform for propaganda. While details are still scarce, any agreement would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based entity to address these national security concerns. The move comes ahead of a new deadline for a ban, with President Trump scheduled to discuss the terms with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

The verdict found the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District negligent for failing to prevent the abuse, which primarily occurred during unsupervised, alcohol-fueled European trips Poe chaperoned for recent graduates. The women, now in their 50s and 60s, testified that Poe groomed them on campus before assaulting them on the trips.

This move comes as Musk's attention is divided among his many other companies and political activities. The board's proposal reflects a belief that Musk's personal involvement is critical to Tesla's high valuation and is essentially a bid to ensure he doesn't shift his focus elsewhere, despite the risks his erratic behavior can pose.
