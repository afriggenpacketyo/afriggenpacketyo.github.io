          <p>The Powerball jackpot, soaring to $1.7 billion, is creating a surge in business for DraftKings-owned lottery courier app, Jackpocket. The company reported a 130% day-over-day increase in ticket sales on its platform, which operates similarly to a food delivery service by purchasing tickets on behalf of users for a fee. This growth comes despite some states, like Texas, banning such courier services. DraftKings acquired Jackpocket in 2024, viewing it as a key opportunity to cross-sell customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming products, projecting substantial future revenue from the subsidiary.</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial strategists are advising investors to consider defensive measures to protect their significant portfolio gains. While a weakening labor market may prompt a Federal Reserve rate cut, which is often good for stocks, it also signals potential economic trouble ahead. Experts suggest that portfolios are likely over-concentrated in mega-cap technology stocks, creating significant risk. They recommend re-evaluating this exposure and considering a gradual shift toward value and defensive sectors that have not participated as much in the recent market rally.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the August jobs report release, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted that the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics would become more accurate. He attributed this expected improvement to President Trump's recent firing of former Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, who was a holdover from the previous administration. Lutnick suggested that some officials had been "rooting against America" and that the agency would now be more aligned with the administration's goal of producing correct numbers. Shortly after his comments, the BLS reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by a sluggish 22,000, well below expectations.</p>

The raid involved multiple agencies, including ICE, the FBI, and the ATF, as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices. The sweep targeted the construction site for a new electric vehicle battery plant, a project previously hailed as a major economic development for the state. South Korea's Foreign Ministry has expressed concern, urging the U.S. to ensure the rights of its citizens are not infringed upon.</p>

          <p>Amid discussions in Germany about reintroducing military service to meet NATO obligations, advice centers for conscientious objectors are seeing a significant rise in inquiries. The government recently passed a law requiring young men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to join the army, seen as a step toward potential conscription. While polls show older Germans favor bringing back military service, many young people feel insecure and oppose the increasing militarization of society. German law protects the right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience, a process that requires a detailed personal application to the authorities.</p>

          <p>A United Nations report has detailed horrific atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, concluding that serious rights violations by both Congolese forces and M23 rebels may amount to war crimes. The investigation found evidence of summary executions, torture, and systematic sexual violence by the M23 rebel group, which the report states receives support from Rwanda. The probe also implicated pro-government militias and Congolese armed forces in grave violations, including gang sexual assault and the killing of civilians. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described the findings as horrific, holding both the DRC and Rwanda responsible for their support of abusive armed groups.</p>

          <p>The investment platform Yieldstreet has told customers they are unlikely to see any repayment on $89 million worth of defaulted marine loans issued in 2018 and 2019. The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, but stated this amount will be used to cover its own extensive legal expenses, leaving investors with significant losses. Yieldstreet had sued the borrowers for fraud after losing track of the ships intended as collateral for the loans. This news follows other recent reports of customer losses on the platform, which has since shifted its business model toward distributing funds from established Wall Street firms.</p>

          <p>A decade after the landmark arrest of the "Feminist Five," China's feminist movement faces a paradoxical situation of growing public awareness but shrinking space for expression. The Chinese government has systematically silenced feminist voices, banning prominent social media accounts and framing the movement as a subversive tool of foreign influence. Activists who speak out against sexual harassment or gender inequality face censorship, doxing, and even imprisonment. Despite this harsh suppression, activists say the movement continues in a decentralized form through informal networks, challenging both patriarchal norms and the state's political restrictions.</p>

          <p>A new collection of translated short stories by acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong, titled "Snowy Day and Other Stories," showcases his mastery of evocative imagery, a skill evident in his films like "Burning." The review highlights how Lee, who began his career as a fiction writer, uses visual language to communicate the harsh, paranoid atmosphere of living under South Korea's military dictatorship in the 1980s. Rather than explaining emotions or political realities directly, Lee's stories create feelings and suspense through powerful descriptions of light, darkness, and landscape, asking the reader to participate in interpreting the narrative's deeper meaning.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is sending ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico, significantly escalating its military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean. This deployment follows a recent deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat alleged to be carrying Venezuelan drug traffickers. The move is seen as part of a sustained campaign targeting what the administration calls a Venezuelan-led drug trafficking threat. The Pentagon also accused the Venezuelan military of a "highly provocative" act after its planes flew close to a U.S. warship in international waters, further heightening regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal "state sponsors of wrongful detention" designation, allowing the U.S. to punish countries that use detained Americans as political leverage. This new measure, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, would provide the State Department with tools to penalize nations and potentially issue travel restrictions. The move is intended to deter hostage-taking and has been praised by the family of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who was wrongfully detained by Iran and died in captivity.</p>

          <p>Israel's military reports it has taken "operational control" of nearly half of Gaza City as it prepares for a larger ground offensive, recalling 60,000 reservists for the operation.

United Nations aid agencies and several Western governments are urging Israel to halt the offensive, warning of an even greater humanitarian crisis and an unfeasible evacuation.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning that any foreign military forces deployed to Ukraine would be treated as "legitimate targets" by the Russian army. His statement came in response to discussions among European leaders about providing a potential peacekeeping or "reassurance" force as part of future security guarantees for Ukraine once the conflict ends. Putin dismissed the need for such a force, asserting that Moscow would comply with any agreed-upon treaty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, suggested that thousands of Western troops could be part of a post-war security arrangement.</p>
