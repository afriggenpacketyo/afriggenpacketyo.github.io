          <p>Susan Monarez has abruptly departed from her role as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just weeks after her Senate confirmation. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed her exit without providing a reason, making her the shortest-serving director in the agency's history. Her departure coincides with the resignation of at least four other senior officials in a major leadership shakeup. This comes at a challenging time for the CDC, which is still recovering from a fatal shooting at its Atlanta headquarters earlier in the month.</p>

Authorities are investigating the motive and reviewing videos the shooter timed to publish on social media.

          <p>In a provocative political maneuver, California Assembly Republicans have proposed a resolution to split the state into two, separating the coastal Democratic areas from the more rural Republican inland regions. The proposal, dubbed a "two-state solution," is a direct response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative aimed at redrawing congressional maps, which Republicans have labeled a "gavinmander." While the plan to divide the state is considered a political nonstarter and has been dismissed by Democrats as a stunt, it highlights the intense partisan divisions fueling the nationwide fight for congressional control.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, China is positioning itself as a key defender of the post-war international order, a role that challenges the Western narrative of Beijing as a revisionist power. The article examines how China's significant sacrifices during the war, where an estimated 35 million Chinese nationals died, underpin its current diplomatic stance. As tensions with Western nations, particularly the U.S., continue, China increasingly asserts that it is upholding global norms against what it perceives as destabilizing actions from the G7 and its allies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, projecting continued strong sales growth driven by the high demand for its artificial intelligence hardware. Despite the positive overall report, the company's stock experienced a decline in after-hours trading. This was primarily because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, fell slightly short of analyst expectations for the second consecutive quarter. The report confirms Nvidia's central role in the global AI infrastructure buildout, though it also marked the slowest growth period in its recent nine-quarter streak of over 50% gains.

          <p>To commemorate the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's brutal murder, family members and officials are retracing his final journey on a train from Chicago to Mississippi. The event, organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, includes his cousin Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., the last living eyewitness to the 1955 kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was lynched while visiting family, and his mother's decision to have an open-casket funeral became a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.

While the shots are approved for all seniors, access for younger, healthy individuals is now limited, and the emergency use authorization for healthy children under five has been rescinded. This decision, which the American Academy of Pediatrics called "deeply troubling," means there is no longer a federally authorized COVID vaccine for this age group.

          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and interest rates, a recent analysis from Edmunds reveals that nearly one in five new car buyers now has a monthly payment of $1,000 or more. To help consumers navigate this costly market, the article outlines five key mistakes to avoid. These include buying a car beyond one's financial means, relying solely on dealership financing without securing a preapproved loan, and trading in a vehicle with negative equity. The guidance also recommends working with a dealership's internet sales team for better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid rapid depreciation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Universities across the United States are experiencing a notable drop in international student enrollment as the fall semester begins, largely due to delays and increased scrutiny in the student visa process. Institutions like the University at Buffalo and Arizona State University are reporting declines, with an estimated 150,000 fewer new international students expected nationwide. This trend could result in a $7 billion loss to the U.S. economy and impact campus diversity and innovation. The decline comes amid mixed messaging from the Trump administration, which has both tightened visa security and recently expressed a desire to attract more students from abroad.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers have a narrowing window to lock in high yields on certificates of deposit (CDs). To maximize returns before rates fall, savers are advised to act proactively. Key strategies include shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions, and carefully calculating the deposit amount to avoid early withdrawal penalties. It is also recommended to secure the longest-term CD that fits one's financial plan, as this can lock in a favorable rate for an extended period. (not investment advice)</p>

Citing investigative reporting, the lawsuit alleges Aymond and other officials knew about widespread abuse for years and failed to disclose it.

          <p>For homeowners considering tapping into their home's equity, September may be an opportune time to apply for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Current average HELOC rates are significantly lower than those for personal loans and credit cards, making it a cheaper borrowing option. Furthermore, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the variable rates on HELOCs could become even more favorable for borrowers. Rising home equity levels across the country also mean that homeowners may have a larger pool of funds to access for major expenses or investments. (not investment advice)</p>

The government maintains the extension was always an interim measure and is now reverting the policy for most refugees starting in September.

The article explores this tension, noting that while the Fed's structure may have flaws, its operational independence is designed to prevent politicians from making unsound, short-term economic decisions for political gain.
