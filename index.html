          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood Italian restaurant that bears his name, has passed away at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. A former professional soccer player and actor, Tana opened his eatery in 1964, creating a late-night haven for Hollywood's elite that became an institution known for its classic red-sauce dishes and celebrity clientele. Although he sold the restaurant in 2009, its old-world charm and discreet service have allowed it to endure as a beloved landmark in the Los Angeles dining scene.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off, signaling escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The postponement comes as India faces a cumulative 50% tariff rate from the U.S., partly imposed as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, highlighting that American and European allies continue their own trade with Russia. The U.S. is India's largest single export partner, making the stalled negotiations a significant concern for Indian manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has strengthened to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and wind after rapidly intensifying to a Category 5 storm before weakening slightly.

Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for significant erosion threats as Erin tracks northward between Bermuda and the mainland.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that makes biological tissues, including brains, transparent, allowing for the clearest and most vivid 3D imaging of their internal structures to date. The technique preserves the tissue's original morphology while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. By creating an "ionic glassy tissue" at low temperatures, the method produces highly accurate images and allows for long-term storage of the preserved samples, advancing the study of complex biological systems.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed support for a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin that would see Moscow take full control of Ukraine's Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would agree to freeze the current front lines in other occupied territories like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This marks a significant shift in U.S. policy, moving away from calls for a simple ceasefire towards a permanent peace agreement that would involve Ukraine ceding sovereign territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected surrendering the Donbas, is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House.</p>

The game was characterized by a series of costly mistakes from the Padres, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a critical dropped fly ball that allowed two runs to score. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's sloppy play to clinch the head-to-head season series against their division rivals.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to hold a video call with French and German leaders to coordinate a European response to the recent summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. While Starmer commended Trump's efforts for bringing an end to the war "closer than ever before," he emphasized that any path to peace cannot be decided without the involvement of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The call among the "coalition of the willing" comes after Trump shifted his stance from demanding a ceasefire to pursuing a direct peace agreement, a move that has caused concern among allies.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's upcoming meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington is fraught with diplomatic peril, as he must appear open to peace talks while resisting pressure to accept unfavorable terms. Optimism following the Trump-Putin summit quickly faded after Trump abandoned the call for a ceasefire and instead endorsed a direct peace deal, reportedly based on Russia's proposal for Ukraine to cede more territory. This places Zelenskyy in a difficult position, risking being portrayed as an obstacle to peace if he refuses, while any agreement on Russia's terms would mean continued conflict and territorial loss for Ukraine.</p>

Experts believe an overheating planet is expanding tick habitats, increasing the risk of human encounters and the transmission of illnesses like Lyme disease.

During the trial, his defense admitted his guilt but argued for insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia.

The article suggests that factors such as a lifetime of repressing emotions to please others, the rigid self-imprisonment of perfectionism, and having poor personal boundaries developed in childhood can create a breaking point. Additionally, affairs can be a subconscious attempt to escape an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage, or a reaction to a significant personal loss, like the death of a parent, which triggers a re-evaluation of one's life.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C. as part of President Trump's public safety emergency declaration may be armed. While an official stated the troops are not currently making arrests, they can carry weapons consistent with their mission to protect federal assets and provide a secure environment for law enforcement. This represents a shift from earlier guidance, which indicated that weapons would be available but stored in an armory. The deployment is part of a broader federal effort to address what the administration describes as a crime wave in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>A new wave of COVID-19 infections is spreading across the United States, driven by the highly contagious "Stratus" variant, with the Southwest reporting the nation's highest positivity rate at 12.5%. The spike coincides with students returning to school and follows a controversial change in CDC policy, which no longer recommends updated COVID shots for healthy children. Public health experts have criticized the decision, pointing to data showing that boosters significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, even as the virus continues to evolve and evade prior immunity.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. Mike Conner purchased the abandoned, listed building in 2017 for £555,000 and undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which included installing running water and electricity on the remote island. Now equipped with 40 beds and a nightclub, the historic fortress, once built to defend against French naval attacks, is back on the market as a unique party and event destination for £3 million.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are sharing creative and meticulous strategies to manage the cost of feeding children during the six-week school summer holidays. Tactics include stocking freezers with "yellow sticker" reduced-price items, batch cooking, and organizing the fridge to ensure food with the nearest use-by date is used first to minimize waste. Some families also rely on local food pantries that provide surplus food from supermarkets for a small fee, highlighting the financial pressures many households face when subsidized school meals are unavailable.</p>

The agency stated the pause is for a "full and thorough review" of the procedures for issuing temporary medical-humanitarian visas. The decision followed a social media campaign by a far-right activist criticizing the program, and it has drawn condemnation from aid groups like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, which warned of a devastating impact on children needing lifesaving care unavailable in war-torn Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an ongoing heatwave, parts of the UK are showing signs typically associated with autumn, such as leaves turning yellow and falling from trees. Experts attribute this phenomenon not to a seasonal shift but to "false autumn," a stress response in trees caused by a prolonged period of heat and drought. Conservation groups like the Wildlife Trusts are concerned that this disruption to natural cycles could have negative knock-on effects for wildlife, as an early ripening of fruits like blackberries could lead to food shortages for birds and other animals later in the winter.</p>

          <p>A homeless encampment in Washington D.C. was dismantled by city officials just four days after President Donald Trump posted a photo of it on social media and demanded that the unhoused "move out, IMMEDIATELY." The president subsequently announced a broader crackdown on homelessness in the capital, framing it as a public safety issue. One resident, who was identified in the president's photo, expressed shock at being used as a "political tool" before he and others were forced to relocate as a bulldozer cleared the site. The White House stated it will offer shelter placement, with potential fines or jail time for refusal.</p>

          <p>After 11 years, an inquest into the death of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers in Kenya has concluded, with a magistrate ruling that the cause of death could not be determined due to the body's decomposition. Veevers' body has remained in a mortuary for over a decade due to a bitter family feud that pitted his two sons against his second wife and their two daughters. The sons alleged their father was poisoned to gain his inheritance and had his body exhumed, but conflicting forensic reports and legal delays plagued the case, leaving the family divided on where he should be buried.</p>

The exercise served as a poignant reflection on their journey through a uniquely disrupted education, marked by remote learning and social bubbles, as they now stand on the cusp of a major academic milestone.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a Chilean town once known as Colonia Dignidad, is grappling with its dark past as a secretive German cult that collaborated with the Pinochet dictatorship. The site, where residents were abused and political prisoners were tortured, has been partially transformed into a tourist destination with a hotel and restaurant by remaining members. Now, the Chilean government plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the regime's victims. The plan has divided the community, with some supporting the creation of a place of remembrance while others fear it will displace them once again.</p>
