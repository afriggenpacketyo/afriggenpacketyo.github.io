          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for increased prices, suggesting the company should "eat the tariffs" instead of passing costs onto consumers. Walmart had warned that prices on various goods could increase despite tariff reductions on China. Trump argued that Walmart, having made billions in profits, should sacrifice some of those profits to support his economic agenda. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company aims to keep prices as low as possible despite the challenges posed by retail margins.</p>
