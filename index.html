          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California in 2026. In a public statement, Harris expressed her love for her home state but concluded that her future in public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision follows months of speculation about her next political move after her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris indicate she is considering other avenues for public engagement, such as writing a book and campaigning for Democrats, while keeping the option of a 2028 presidential run open.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at the Horizon Biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, has killed three people: an adult male employee and two young girls. The victims were reported missing after the blast on Tuesday and their bodies were recovered a day later as rescue efforts shifted to recovery. The employee, Dylan Danielson, was at the plant, and the two children, both under 12, were reportedly waiting for him. The explosion caused significant structural damage to the facility, and the ensuing fire hampered emergency response efforts in the industrial area.</p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) has launched a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal action over expressing their faith. The fund was created using settlement money from BGEA's own legal victories in the U.K., supplemented by a contribution from Samaritan's Purse. Franklin Graham and his daughter, Cissie Graham Lynch, emphasized that the initiative aims to combat the silencing of religious expression, a trend they see growing in both Europe and the United States. They highlighted the importance of protecting religious freedom and free speech against cultural and legal pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant downturn in its second-quarter financial results, with operating profit falling by more than half compared to the previous year. The decline was primarily driven by a staggering 93.8% plunge in profits from its crucial semiconductor division, which faced challenges from inventory adjustments and export restrictions. While the company's mobile division saw increased sales and profit from its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones, the poor performance of the chip business caused the overall results to miss analyst expectations. Samsung aims to focus on high-demand AI-related products to recover in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic rift has emerged between the United States and several of its key allies, including the U.K., France, and Canada, over the issue of Palestinian statehood. These nations have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move the Trump administration has boycotted and labeled an "insult." This divergence highlights a growing international effort to revive the two-state solution, even without U.S. participation. The shift by European and North American allies is partly driven by the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the lack of a clear long-term U.S. plan for the region's governance and peace.</p>

While Russia experienced flooding from waves up to 16 feet, the impact on the U.S. was minimal, with warnings eventually downgraded to advisories as the largest waves recorded were around 5 feet in Hawaii. Evacuations occurred in Hawaii and coastal communities, but widespread damage was avoided. Experts noted the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open ocean, dissipating before reaching more populated areas.</p>

Evidence presented during the trial included Craig's incriminating internet search history, with queries about undetectable poisons.

          <p>Following a devastating wildfire, Los Angeles officials have restricted the construction of duplexes in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, responding to resident concerns about increased density and evacuation risks. The move was enabled by an executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom, which created an exemption to a state law, SB 9, that otherwise promotes denser housing. While residents feared duplexes would transform their single-family community, there has been little opposition to the building of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), which also increase density. This has led pro-development groups to accuse officials of yielding to a powerful constituency rather than addressing legitimate safety issues.</p>

The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the expensive and complex task of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company argues its proposal, estimated to cost under £25 billion, offers a more efficient and less risky alternative to Heathrow's own, more costly plan. This development introduces competition into the long-debated expansion project for the first time, with the government now set to review both bids.</p>

          <p>Advanced imaging technology has provided an unprecedented look at the complex tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female mummy from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution scans revealed detailed decorations of animals and mythical creatures that were previously indistinct, showcasing a high level of sophistication. Researchers collaborated with a tattooist specializing in ancient methods to analyze the work, concluding that the tattoos were likely stenciled and created with multi-pointed tools. The findings offer new insights into the cultural practices and artistic skill of this ancient nomadic warrior society.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute has erupted between France and Spain following the removal of a group of French Jewish teenagers from a Vueling flight in Valencia. French ministers have condemned the "excessive and brutal" use of force by Spanish police, who handcuffed the group's female leader, and criticized a Spanish minister for calling the teens "Israeli brats." Vueling airline maintains the group was removed for disruptive behavior, including mishandling safety equipment, an account disputed by other passengers and the group's lawyer. The incident has led to allegations of antisemitism, which both the airline and Spanish police have denied.</p>

          <p>Shares of chip designer Arm Holdings fell after the company's first-quarter earnings report revealed that revenue from its core smartphone business was weaker than anticipated. While overall results were in line with expectations, the slower growth in royalties from smartphone chips disappointed investors. In a strategic shift, CEO Rene Haas confirmed the company is exploring designing its own chip components or even full solutions to provide customers with a better starting point for development. This move into producing its own hardware could introduce new execution risks by turning some of its current customers into direct competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has initiated a large-scale recruitment campaign, offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 to attract new deportation officers, lawyers, and investigators. The campaign, which uses patriotic themes, is funded by a recent $76.5 billion congressional allocation aimed at expanding immigration enforcement to meet the Trump administration's goal of one million annual deportations. This rapid expansion has raised concerns among former officials and policing experts about the potential for lowered hiring standards and the impact on local law enforcement agencies, which may lose officers to the highly competitive federal positions.</p>

          <p>Canada has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, joining the United Kingdom and France in a significant shift in policy among G7 nations. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the move is conditional on the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms and holding elections without the participation of Hamas. The decision reflects growing international frustration with the expansion of Israeli settlements and the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry criticized the announcement, calling it a "reward for Hamas" and detrimental to ceasefire efforts.</p>

          <p>At the request of President Trump, Texas Republicans are moving forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts five years ahead of the typical schedule. Governor Greg Abbott convened a special legislative session to work on a new map that could potentially give the GOP up to 30 of the state's 38 House seats, bolstering their national majority. This has sparked a political battle, with Democrats in Texas and other states like California and Illinois threatening retaliatory gerrymandering. The move raises concerns about increasing political polarization and eroding voter faith in democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>The body of Jomarie Calasanz, who was swept away in the Kaweah River two months ago, has been recovered and identified by authorities in Sequoia National Park. Calasanz went missing in May after she and her sister were pulled by a strong current while swimming.

The operation involved multiple agencies using drones, dive teams, and search dogs, finally concluding when water levels subsided enough for a safe recovery.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a consumer warning after some cans of Celsius energy drink were accidentally filled with vodka during a production mix-up.

As a result, both companies have issued recalls for the affected product lots, which were distributed in several states.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little tsunami damage across the Pacific. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this fortunate outcome. The main energy of the resulting tsunami was projected into a relatively empty stretch of the open ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching populated coastlines like California. While the event triggered widespread alerts, it served as a best-case scenario for a distant, powerful earthquake, avoiding a major catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting a net impact of $2 billion from the import taxes. The automaker's second-quarter revenue beat analyst expectations, but its updated guidance for adjusted earnings is lower than pre-tariff estimates. The company reported a net loss for the quarter, largely due to special charges related to a major vehicle recall. Ford's commercial "Pro" division was a bright spot, showing strong revenue growth, while its "Model e" electric vehicle unit continued to post significant losses. (not investment advice)</p>
