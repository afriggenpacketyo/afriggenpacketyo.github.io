          <p>A shooting at a student housing complex at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque resulted in one fatality and one person with non-life-threatening injuries. The incident prompted a campus-wide shelter-in-place order as the suspect remained at large and was believed to still be on campus. In response to the threat, the university closed its central Albuquerque campus as a precautionary measure while law enforcement conducted their investigation. The situation is ongoing, with authorities actively searching for the suspect involved in the early morning violence.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Trump's visit to Scotland to open a new golf course, local residents near his Balmedie club express a range of opinions. Some neighbors, like David Milne, remain critical of Trump's development, citing environmental changes and contentious interactions during the course's construction. While the club has brought employment and economic benefits to the area, many locals struggle to separate the president's political actions from his business ventures. Protests are planned for his visit, reflecting a broader sentiment in Scotland where polls show a high disapproval rating for Trump.</p>

          <p>The Republican Study Committee (RSC), a prominent conservative caucus in the House, has initiated plans for a second major legislative package to advance President Trump's agenda. Following the passage of the first "big, beautiful bill," this new working group aims to develop a framework for another budget reconciliation bill. The goal is to build on the momentum of the first six months of the Republican-controlled government and address key policy areas like cost of living and economic restoration. This effort signals a long-term strategy by congressional Republicans to enact significant policy changes.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board report concluded that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene "Buzzy" Peltola Jr., husband of then-Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by overloading the aircraft. The Piper PA-18 plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum gross weight due to a large quantity of moose meat from a hunting trip. Additionally, an unapproved external load of moose antlers was strapped to the wing strut, which degraded the plane's takeoff performance and flight characteristics. The report details how these factors led to the pilot losing control, resulting in the fatal wreck.</p>

          <p>In a housing market characterized by high rates and limited inventory, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance face significant challenges. As of July 25, 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.79%, while a 15-year loan averages 6.01%. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers, but emphasize the importance of a strong credit profile to secure the best rates. To improve their chances, applicants are advised to maintain a high credit score and compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has lowered its financial outlook for the year after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The company attributed the decline to significant financial pressures, including a 1.3 billion euro impact from U.S. tariffs in the first half of the year and 700 million euros in restructuring costs. Consequently, Volkswagen revised its expected operating return on sales down to a range of 4% to 5% from a previous 5.5% to 6.5%. The results highlight the broader challenges facing European carmakers, including intense competition and disruptive trade policies.</p>

The decision follows a dispute where a federal court attempted to install Habba's deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, as the state's top prosecutor.

They argue that the anonymity of agents makes it difficult for individuals to verify their legitimacy and has led to criminals impersonating officers.

          <p>The European Union is preparing for a potential trade standoff with the United States as an August 1 deadline for new U.S. tariffs approaches. Lawmakers have approved a major package of retaliatory tariffs on up to 93 billion euros of American goods, which could be imposed if President Trump follows through on a threatened 30% tariff on EU imports. Brussels is also reportedly considering its "trade bazooka," an anti-coercion instrument designed to deter economic interference. While talks of a deal are ongoing, the EU is positioning itself to respond swiftly to protect its economic interests.</p>

          <p>A recent summit between EU leaders and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing revealed significant friction, with little progress made on major geopolitical and trade disputes. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the EU-China trade imbalance as having reached an "inflection point," urging Beijing to provide real solutions for its export surplus. The EU also raised concerns about China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, which Chinese officials deflected. While a minor agreement was made on climate change cooperation, the summit underscored a growing divide, with the EU signaling a more hawkish stance.</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated into serious military clashes along their disputed border, resulting in over 20 reported deaths, mostly Thai civilians. Thailand's military conducted airstrikes after accusing Cambodia of firing artillery shells across the border near the contested Ta Moan Thom Temple. This violence is the worst since 2011 and follows weeks of rising tensions, including the downgrading of diplomatic relations. The conflict is complicated by internal Thai politics and nationalist sentiments, with international bodies like the UN and ASEAN calling for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Approximately 6,000 websites featuring pornographic content in the UK are now required to verify that their users are over 18, according to the media regulator Ofcom. This new rule, part of the Online Safety Act, has seen major platforms like Pornhub, Reddit, and X (formerly Twitter) agree to implement age-check systems. Ofcom's chief executive praised the move as a significant step for child safety online, a measure she said no other country has successfully implemented on this scale. However, experts and child safety advocates express skepticism about how easily these checks can be circumvented.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, escalating his ongoing conflict with media outlets. The lawsuit, filed in Miami, pertains to an article describing an allegedly obscene birthday card Trump sent to Jeffrey Epstein two decades ago. This legal action is part of a broader pattern in Trump's second term of using the courts to punish media organizations he deems critical. In conjunction with the lawsuit, the White House has also barred the Wall Street Journal from the press pool for an upcoming presidential trip.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that the death of 19-year-old Jay Slater, who went missing in Tenerife, was an accident resulting from a fall. Slater's body was found in a remote ravine after a massive search operation. The inquest heard that he had become lost after a night out and was attempting a 14-hour walk back to his accommodation. The coroner determined that Slater fell up to 25 meters in a dangerous area, suffering fatal skull fractures and brain trauma, and that his death was likely instantaneous. Contributing factors may have included drugs, lack of sleep, and unsuitable clothing.</p>

          <p>Manchester City is set to re-sign goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley for £27 million, just two years after he left the club's academy. The deal was triggered after City exercised their buy-back and matching rights clause when Newcastle United made a bid for the 22-year-old England Under-21 international. Trafford, who impressed during Burnley's promotion-winning season, is expected to sign a five-year contract and will provide competition for current first-choice keeper Ederson. The move highlights City's strategy of inserting buy-back clauses on academy graduates to reclaim promising talent.</p>

          <p>PayZen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to purchase medical debt from hospitals, argues that its long-term, interest-free payment plans can help solve the healthcare affordability crisis in the U.S. The company's business model involves buying patient debt from cash-strapped hospitals at a discount and then collecting the full value from patients over time. While the CEO frames this as a solution to an "affordability problem," consumer advocates raise concerns about a lack of transparency. They also worry that low-income patients eligible for charity care might be improperly enrolled in these payment plans.</p>
