          <p>This article discusses the influence of right-wing intellectuals on Donald Trump's policies, highlighting a disconnect between their views and mainstream America. These intellectuals, often feeling marginalized in liberal-dominated fields like journalism and academia, create echo chambers that reinforce their sense of cultural threat. Figures like Patrick Deneen and Michael Anton argue that American society has become hostile to conservatives, justifying authoritarian measures as defensive. With individuals like JD Vance and Pete Hegseth now in key positions, these ideas are shaping policy in areas ranging from immigration to education.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, which includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties argue this could undercut British workers, but the government insists the deal will not impact them, citing existing agreements preventing double taxation. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India by Â£25.5bn a year by 2040, particularly benefiting UK exports like whisky and cars. The Scotch Whisky Association anticipates a Â£1bn increase in Scotch exports to India over five years, creating 1,200 jobs in the UK.</p>

          <p>Container bookings from China to the United States have dropped 27% year-on-year, reaching their lowest level since February, according to data from Vizion. The decline in container bookings, a proxy for export activity, is attributed to the impact of increased US tariffs, causing disruption and sourcing shifts. Shippers had rushed to move products in the first quarter but pulled back sharply due to the new tariff policies. Uncertainty over future tariff levels is leading supply chain teams to rethink timing, inventory levels, and sourcing strategies.</p>

While AI models are improving, human superforecasters still outperform machines in prediction tournaments. The best AI model in a recent competition used a simple approach, pulling news articles and asking a language model to make predictions. AI's limitations include poor quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research skills. However, AI could potentially surpass humans in forecasting due to its ability to learn from mistakes and avoid biases. As AI forecasting improves, it could have significant implications for various fields, from law to medicine.</p>

India claimed it targeted militant infrastructure linked to a recent terrorist attack in Kashmir, while Pakistan said it shot down Indian fighter jets in retaliation. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed a strong response.

          <p>Sixteen individuals, including a Sinaloa cartel leader, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, have been arrested in a multi-state fentanyl bust, resulting in the seizure of three million fentanyl-laced pills.

Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the severity of the fentanyl crisis, stating that it causes 75,000 American deaths each year and is the leading cause of death for those aged 18-34 in the United States. Law enforcement seized over 400 kilograms of fentanyl pills, along with other drugs, cash, and firearms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to eliminate federal research on pollution from satellites and rockets, which could benefit Elon Musk's space companies. These projects aimed to study the accumulation of metals from spacecraft in the stratosphere and understand the impact of spaceflight on Earth's climate. Critics argue this decision protects a prolific donor and political ally, while former NOAA officials say the administration froze funding for both projects, which benefited Musk. The move raises conflict-of-interest concerns, leaving the health of the stratosphere largely in the hands of private companies.</p>

          <p>Footage showing an Egyptian military officer in a Chinese J-10 fighter jet during a joint exercise has intensified speculation about a potential arms sale between China and Egypt. The joint air training, the first between the two countries, is seen as a possible indicator of Cairo's interest in acquiring Chinese jets. This follows months of reports regarding Egypt's potential purchase of the J-10C, which has been compared to upgraded versions of the US F-16. Such a deal would expand Beijing's arms exports and potentially reshape the regional geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>A Republican state representative in Texas, Stan Gerdes, has introduced the FURRIES Act, aiming to prohibit students from behaving like animals in schools. This includes activities like hissing, meowing, and using litter boxes. Gerdes claims to have heard reports of furry-related incidents but could not provide evidence of schools providing litter boxes. The bill is viewed as a cynical attempt to undermine public education and justify defunding schools, using culture war issues to distract voters and promote legislation that benefits the wealthy. The myth that schools are hotbeds of cat-litter-based activity has been circulating for years, amplified by numerous Republicans and conservative influencers.</p>

          <p>This article explores the importance of trust in relationships and the factors that contribute to its erosion. Research suggests that political polarization, economic inequality, and technology play a role in declining trust levels. Trust is built on competence, benevolence, and integrity, with initial judgments often based on imperfect cues. While some inclination to trust is genetic, distrust is learned through negative experiences. To foster trust, the article suggests approaching differences with curiosity, embracing a team mindset, and leaning into transparency.</p>

          <p>California Democrats initially killed a bill to crack down on buying teens for sex, sparking controversy and accusations of being soft on sex crimes. The bill, written by a freshman Democrat, aimed to close a loophole in a previous law that treated soliciting minors differently based on their age. After facing criticism, Democrats reversed course and revived the bill, making buying sex from a 16- or 17-year-old an automatic felony if the buyer is more than three years older. This underscores the political challenges surrounding the issue of sex trafficking and the decriminalization of sex work.</p>

          <p>California's high energy prices, including gasoline and electricity, are attributed to the state's green energy policies, which prioritize expensive and intermittent renewable energy sources. While proponents argue that these policies are necessary for a carbon-less future, critics point to the economic consequences, such as energy poverty and income declines for lower-income individuals. The state's reliance on renewable energy and refusal to tap into its own fossil fuel resources is driving jobs and investment to other states. To ensure its economic viability, California needs to develop affordable, reliable energy from all sources, including its fossil fuel supplies.</p>

He also voiced disapproval of Trump's territorial designs on Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. The term appeasement refers to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlainâ€™s efforts in the 1930s to appease Adolf Hitlerâ€™s moves to annex land in Europe, which failed to prevent World War II.</p>

Under the proposed change, an attacker would be considered onside if any part of their body is in line with the last outfield defender. Wenger argues this would restore an advantage to the attacker that has been eroded by VAR. Trials of the system have already taken place in Italian youth football, and further trials will happen before a final decision in 2026. Any change to the offside rule rests with the sport's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab).</p>
