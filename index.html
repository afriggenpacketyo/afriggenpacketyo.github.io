            <p>This article discusses the alarming trend of wealthy individuals and corporations seeking to create their own sovereign territories, or "freedom cities," and the connection to end-times ideologies. Inspired by philosophies of "exit," these figures aim to carve up the world into hyper-capitalist havens, shielded by private mercenaries and AI robots. The author argues that this vision aligns with a broader far-right movement embracing a monstrous survivalism, preparing for a future of shocks, scarcity, and collapse, and ultimately betraying our duties to one another and the planet.</p>

            <p>An outgoing US vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, has criticized Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for giving families "false hope" by claiming he can quickly determine the cause of autism. Marks, who resigned due to Kennedy's anti-vaccination misinformation, emphasized that autism is a complex issue involving genetic and environmental factors. He refuted Kennedy's assertion that vaccines are a potential cause, citing extensive studies proving their safety, and blamed Kennedy's rhetoric for recent measles deaths in the US, which are a result of vaccine hesitancy.</p>

            <p>Autoworkers and small business owners in Michigan are expressing mixed reactions to President Trump's tariff policies, with some fearing the potential for increased prices and economic hardship.

            <p>President Trump initially vowed not to retreat on his tariff policies but later paused higher trade tariffs for most countries, excluding China, after facing significant economic and political pressure. The decision, made after weeks of market instability and international condemnation, damaged America's standing as a reliable ally and raised concerns about Trump's economic leadership. Republicans, business leaders, and voters expressed anxiety over the potential for a recession, leading to the administration's abrupt reversal and highlighting the limitations of Trump's "strongman" image.</p>

            <p>California farmers are expressing anxiety over President Trump's tariff policies, which have imposed levies on key export markets like Canada and China. The retaliatory tariffs from these countries are threatening sales of California's almonds, pistachios, oranges, and other crops, leading to concerns about long-lasting and damaging conflicts. While the White House is reportedly preparing a relief plan, farmers worry about the potential for lost markets, increased costs, and the future viability of their businesses.

            <p>This article argues that the Trump administration is waging a class war against the professional managerial class (PMC), aiming to crush their power and authority. The administration's actions, such as mass firings, undermining universities, and stigmatizing law firms, are seen as an attempt to destroy the institutional homes of knowledge workers and cognitive elites. By targeting the PMC, the administration is executing a Marxist theory of power, but against a different enemy than traditional progressive movements.</p>

            <p>A recent study suggests that women over 50 may experience greater fat loss by walking at a slower pace compared to faster speeds. The study found that women who walked at 3.2 miles per hour lost significantly more fat than those who walked at 4.1 miles per hour. Researchers theorize that slower speeds may promote fat burning, while faster speeds may rely more on blood sugar for energy, though further research is needed to confirm this link.</p>
