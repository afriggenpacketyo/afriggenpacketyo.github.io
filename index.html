          <p>The UK's public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, has stated it cannot verify the Ministry of Defence's estimated £850 million cost for a data breach and subsequent relocation scheme. The breach in 2022 exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to move to the UK, putting them at risk from the Taliban. A new secret relocation route was established, but the NAO found that the MoD did not properly track its expenses, making the total financial impact, excluding legal and compensation claims, impossible to determine accurately.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge has ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser or Android operating system, following a landmark antitrust case. However, the company is now barred from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on devices and must share certain search data with its competitors. The US Department of Justice had sought a forced sale of Chrome to curb Google's monopoly in online search, but the judge deemed this remedy a "poor fit," leading to a more moderate outcome that still aims to restore competition.</p>

          <p>American filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court case against Rochdale Borough Council in a bid to gain ownership of his ancestral home, Hopwood Hall. DePree, who has spent seven years and £750,000 of his own money to save the derelict stately home, claims he fulfilled the terms of an agreement that would allow him to purchase the property. The council disputes this, arguing his business plans were not viable, and locked him out last year, stating it had a duty to explore other options to protect the historic asset.</p>

The event, held at Tiananmen Square, is set to be a major display of China's military capabilities, featuring troops, fighter jets, and advanced equipment. The presence of Putin and Kim alongside President Xi Jinping is seen as a strategic move to project a unified front and bolster China's leadership role on the global stage, with minimal representation from EU nations.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book by royal correspondent Valentine Low, "Power and the Palace," contains several notable claims about the British royal family's interactions with politics and personal history. The book alleges that Queen Camilla, as a teenager, fought off a sexual assault on a train and had the perpetrator arrested, a story she reportedly shared with Boris Johnson. Other anecdotes include Queen Elizabeth II's private opposition to Brexit, details of negotiations over the Coronation's budget, and tense relationships between the monarchy and various prime ministers, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the palace's inner workings.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B, whose legal name is Belcalis Almánzar, in a lawsuit filed by a security guard who accused her of assault in 2018. The guard, Emani Ellis, had sought $24 million in damages, claiming the rapper spat on her and cut her with a fingernail at a Beverly Hills medical building. Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, contended that Ellis was invasively filming her and refused to give her space, an account supported by testimony from her doctor, leading the jury to dismiss the case.</p>

          <p>The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has resumed its eruptive activity, shooting fountains of lava up to 330 feet into the air from its Halemaʻumaʻu summit crater. This marks the 32nd episode of the current eruption, which began in December 2024, with all molten rock so far being contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that magma is accumulating in a lower chamber before being forced to the surface, a pattern that has occurred in previous historical eruptions and could continue for an unknown duration.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that its deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines in Los Angeles was a "serious violation" of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement except under specific circumstances, which the judge found were not met. The ruling detailed how the administration attempted to circumvent the law by claiming a broad "constitutional exception," an argument the judge dismissed as not grounded in history, jurisprudence, or common sense, highlighting a push towards martial law.</p>

          <p>According to health experts, COVID-19 cases are currently surging across the United States, with particularly high test positivity rates concentrated in the West and South Central regions. States including Texas, California, Oregon, and New Mexico are identified as hotspots, driven by the new Stratus and Nimbus variants, back-to-school season, and summer travel. While tracking data is less reliable than in previous years, available metrics show a clear upward trend in infections and emergency room visits, prompting experts to urge continued caution, including masking in crowded areas and staying home when sick.</p>

          <h2>Trump Urges Supreme Court for Expedited Ruling on His Administration's Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has stated his administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to uphold the legality of his tariffs, which have generated significant federal revenue. He warned that an adverse decision would be "devastation for our country," potentially requiring the government to repay trillions of dollars to other nations and harming domestic investment. The tariffs were implemented under the justification of addressing national emergencies, including trade deficits and fentanyl trafficking, but have faced legal challenges questioning their constitutionality and economic impact.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. Space Command headquarters will be permanently located in Huntsville, Alabama, reversing a Biden-era decision to keep it in Colorado. The president cited Alabama's strong support and claimed, without evidence, that Colorado's mail-in voting system made its elections "crooked," which he said was a factor in the decision. The move was praised by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, who framed it as restoring merit to the process, while the original decision to keep Spacecom in Colorado was based on military readiness concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a strike in the southern Caribbean against a vessel that officials claimed was carrying drugs from Venezuela. President Trump announced the operation, later stating on social media that it resulted in the deaths of 11 "terrorists" associated with the Tren de Aragua crime group. The strike occurs amid heightened tensions, as the U.S. has increased its naval presence in the region for counter-narcotics missions, a move Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has condemned as a threat, accusing the U.S. of attempting to destabilize his government.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he plans to send National Guard troops into Chicago, stating, "We're going in," despite opposition from local and state leaders. This move would follow similar controversial deployments in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, which the administration has framed as anti-crime initiatives. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker called the president's comments "unhinged" and vowed to fight any such deployment in court, arguing there is no emergency that warrants military intervention and that the president is jeopardizing public safety for political purposes.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. footprint by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle this week. Initially, the vehicles will be operated manually by human safety drivers to validate the technology and map the new environments before any transition to fully autonomous services. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to launch its driverless ride-hailing service in more cities across the country, building on its existing commercial operations in markets like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin.</p>
