          <p>Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, a pivotal figure known for his leadership of the Russia investigation into President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. His family disclosed to The New York Times that Mueller, now 81, received the diagnosis in 2021, prompting his retirement from public life and the practice of law by the end of 2022. This health revelation has significant implications, notably leading House investigators to forgo his testimony in the ongoing Epstein probe due to concerns about his well-being. The public acknowledgement provides context for his recent withdrawal from the spotlight, highlighting the personal struggles faced by a figure who has played a critical role in American political history and public service.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been arrested in Sydney after allegedly crashing his car through the gates of the Russian consulate in the suburb of Woollahra. Police responded to reports of an unauthorized vehicle in the driveway around 08:00 local time and attempted to speak with the driver. Following this, the man reportedly drove through the property's entrance gates. One police officer suffered a hand injury during the incident, but authorities confirmed there were no other reports of physical harm. The arrested individual is now cooperating with police inquiries to determine the full context and motivation behind this unusual event at a diplomatic facility.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children unless they possess a formal deportation order. The ruling came hours after lawyers alerted the court to a rapid government effort to deport hundreds of children, with planes already prepared for takeoff from Texas. Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's order mandated that all 76 children slated for Sunday's deportations be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. This extraordinary measure aims to uphold legal protections for these minors, who lawyers argue could face abuse or persecution if returned without proper asylum proceedings.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce a tightening of family reunion rules for migrants granted asylum in the UK, alongside reforms to the asylum appeals system. The changes aim to align the UK with European policies, introducing tougher English language standards and financial requirements for family members. Cooper will also outline government efforts to combat people smuggling and end the use of hotels for asylum seekers, an issue that has sparked recent protests. The proposed legislation seeks to streamline the asylum process and strengthen border security, though opposition parties criticize the government's handling of the overall borders crisis.</p>

          <p>The Guatemalan government has asserted that it proposed the return of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors from the U.S. to prevent them from remaining in shelters and to facilitate family reunification. This statement, released after a U.S. federal judge blocked deportations, suggests Guatemala's proactive role, though NPR noted a factual error regarding the timing of the proposal to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Attorneys representing the children dispute the government's claims of due process, arguing that the U.S. attempted to deport minors without allowing them to pursue asylum claims, violating federal laws and the Constitution.

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple broken bones after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. His spokesperson, Michael Ragusa, confirmed that Giuliani suffered fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations, and injuries to his left arm and lower leg, though these were deemed non-life-threatening. The incident occurred Saturday night, shortly after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who was a victim of domestic violence, contacting 911 and remaining on scene until responding officers arrived. State police clarified that the crash was not a targeted attack, and all three individuals involved, including Giuliani and his associate, were taken to the hospital.</p>

Beyond this, market participants are also closely assessing recent developments in India and China relations, particularly after leaders from both countries agreed to be development partners during a regional security bloc meeting.

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) is identified as the world's largest and most active spy agency, with its primary focus on controlling China's own populace, including those living abroad, and the U.S. as its second target. According to former U.S. diplomat Jim Lewis, the MSS employs various methods to surveil and influence, including monitoring WeChat and infiltrating college campuses. Recruitment tactics for spies in the U.S. involve money, "honey traps," and blackmail, often by threatening family members in China. A notable case involved a former Columbia scholar convicted of spying, underscoring the brazenness and scale of these operations against American interests and Chinese dissidents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion, offering 30 hours per week for children aged nine months to four years to support working parents. While the scheme aims to reduce costs significantly, it faces considerable challenges, including long waiting lists for places and widespread nursery staff shortages. Providers report that low funding rates compel them to increase "consumable" fees, creating confusion for parents expecting "free" care. Concerns are also rising about regional inequalities and parents making extreme decisions, such as altering C-section dates, to meet eligibility criteria, highlighting systemic issues in delivering the promised support effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, driven by its superfood reputation and post-pandemic tourism, has led to significant supply shortages and soaring prices in Japan. Tencha, the tea used for matcha, has seen auction prices jump 170% in a year, and retailers are reporting doubled matcha prices. Japanese farmers struggle to meet this demand due to labor-intensive production and an aging workforce, despite government consideration of subsidies. The "matcha mania" has forced shops to ration supply and major companies like Ito En to create dedicated divisions, raising concerns that future heatwaves could further exacerbate supply issues.</p>

Smith, who had been in a slump, hit a 420-foot missile into the left-field pavilion, securing his fourth career pinch-hit, walk-off homer. This timely win, though tempered by the team's season-long inconsistencies, aims to be a momentum-builder as the Dodgers enter the final month, emphasizing the need for sustained focus and execution.</p>
