            <p>Amazon postponed the launch of its first Kuiper internet satellites due to adverse weather conditions at Cape Canaveral. The United Launch Alliance rocket, carrying 27 Kuiper satellites, was unable to proceed with the launch due to cumulus clouds and strong winds. This launch is crucial for Amazon to compete with SpaceX's Starlink in providing high-speed, low-latency internet services to consumers, corporations, and governments. Amazon faces a deadline from the Federal Communications Commission to have half of its constellation operational by July 2026, making timely launches critical to its strategy.</p>

            <p>At least five nurses working on the same floor of a Boston-area hospital have been diagnosed with brain tumors, prompting an investigation into potential causes. The Massachusetts Nurses Association is supporting the nurses and conducting an independent, scientific investigation into the diagnoses. The hospital conducted its own review and found no environmental risks, although it noted an increased risk of radiation exposure from portable X-rays. The nurses' union is working with the hospital, but believes their testing was not comprehensive.</p>

            <p>President Trump paused higher tariffs for most countries but significantly increased tariffs on China to 125%, citing a lack of respect from Beijing. This action intensifies the existing trade war between the U.S. and China, impacting global trade dynamics. Trump's strategy aims to reshape global trade, challenging China's dominance as the world's factory. The move follows Trump's 'Made in China 2025' policy which set out a huge state-backed vision of becoming a global leader in a number of key manufacturing sectors, from aerospace to ship building to electric vehicles.

            <p>The Department of Justice is seeking to drop criminal charges against a man it identified as the "East Coast leader" of MS-13, Henrry Villatoro Santos, and instead pursue deportation. This decision comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly announced his arrest at a press conference, accusing him of violent crimes. Some former Justice Department officials argue that historically, leaders of violent gangs are prosecuted and convicted before deportation to prevent their return.

            <p>Milwaukee is home to Ascent, the world's tallest timber-concrete hybrid building, showcasing the potential of mass timber construction. Developers highlight the environmental advantages of using wood over steel and concrete, including a lower carbon footprint. Ascent was built using pre-fabricated mass timber pieces, which are strong, light, and cheaper to produce. The building's timber was tested for fire resistance, meeting building codes and ensuring safety. This prototype could be repeated multiple times across the country.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praised the U.S. measles response as a model for the world, comparing it favorably to Europe. However, experts note that this comparison is misleading due to the vast disparities in healthcare and vaccination coverage across the European region.

Dame Rachel suggested that parents need more support managing their children's online habits. The general secretary of the UK's largest teaching union said a government ban on phones would "take the pressure off schools".</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new method to overcome metal fatigue in stainless steel, transforming it into a material suitable for aerospace and other high-grade applications. The research team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Metal Research altered the steel's internal structure by twisting it, significantly increasing its strength and resistance to metal fatigue. The modified steel exhibited more than double the yield strength and up to 10,000 times greater resistance to accumulated damage from metal fatigue. This breakthrough could have applications in undersea pipelines and engine components.</p>
