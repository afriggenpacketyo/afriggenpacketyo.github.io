          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a significant settlement with the Trump administration, paying $200 million to resolve investigations into its handling of antisemitism on campus. This agreement will also lead to the reinstatement of hundreds of millions in frozen federal research grants, which had put the university's operations at a "tipping point." As part of the deal, Columbia has committed to major policy changes, including ending its DEI initiatives, disciplining student protesters, and increasing campus security. The university stated the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing but a necessary step to restore its crucial partnership with the federal government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix reported record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is attributed to the intense demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies and used by clients like Nvidia. The company's success in the HBM market has allowed it to challenge its rival, Samsung Electronics, for dominance in the global memory space. SK Hynix anticipates strong continued demand and plans to increase capital expenditure to support its HBM customers in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age-verification systems to prevent access by children. Under the Online Safety Act, platforms failing to comply could face fines up to £18 million or 10% of their global revenue. Methods for verification include credit card checks and photo ID matching, but the new rules have raised concerns among users about data privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs. While regulators aim to make it harder for minors to access harmful material, critics and some users worry about data security and whether the measures will ultimately be effective.</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly refuted media reports claiming President Donald Trump is named in unsealed Justice Department documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson characterized the claims as "fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media." While Trump was once friendly with Epstein, he has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the case, and being named does not imply criminal activity. This development comes as a Florida judge denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury files from Epstein's 2006 case, citing secrecy rules.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has formally agreed to pay $221 million to the U.S. government to settle investigations and restore its federal funding, which had been withheld by the Trump administration. The settlement includes $200 million related to antisemitism probes and $21 million for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This agreement follows the university's recent sanctioning of dozens of students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, a key point of contention. The deal codifies numerous policy reforms, including changes to the student disciplinary process and a review of its Middle East curriculum, marking a significant development in the administration's campaign to reshape higher education.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified and released additional documents related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, alleging they show Obama administration officials "manufactured" intelligence to undermine Donald Trump. The release, a 2017 Republican-authored House Intelligence Committee report, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and some former intelligence officials. They argue Gabbard is misrepresenting the findings and irresponsibly risking the exposure of sensitive intelligence sources and methods. Gabbard defended the move as an effort to depoliticize the intelligence community, while critics suggest it is a politically motivated attempt to distract from other issues.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court's decision states the order "contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship" to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the children of undocumented immigrants are not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S. and thus do not qualify for automatic citizenship. This ruling upholds a lower court's block on the policy, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to reshape immigration law through executive action.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the electrifying and iconic frontman of Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76, leaving behind a monumental legacy in rock music. This article reflects on how he and his bandmates from working-class Birmingham reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s to invent the genre of heavy metal. Inspired by horror films and shaped by guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style—a result of an industrial accident—the band created a dark, powerful sound that defined a generation. Osbourne's wild stage presence and life of excess became legendary, but the enduring power of Black Sabbath's music cemented his status as one of rock's most influential figures.</p>

This comes after a period with the Boston Red Sox where he was adamant about exclusively handling DH duties, even publicly shutting down suggestions of a position change. Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him more active and mentally engaged in the game, rather than solely focusing on his next at-bat. His successful debut, which included two hits, contributed to the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest over the next 30 years.

Proponents of the resolution, led by Rep. Troy E. Nehls, argue the culling is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some scientists and conservation groups warn that halting the plan will likely lead to the extinction of the northern spotted owl.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, allowing the nation to narrowly avoid a technical recession. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly for semiconductors and chemical products. This export surge was partly fueled by firms expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. Despite the positive quarterly result, domestic consumption remains sluggish and analysts express concern that future growth may be hampered by softening global trade and ongoing tariff uncertainties.

          <p>Venezuelan migrants, recently released from El Salvador's notorious CECOT mega-prison, have provided firsthand accounts of brutal and inhumane conditions. The men were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador under allegations of gang affiliation and were held for months without contact with the outside world. They described systematic beatings by guards, deprivation in punishment cells, and taunting, leading them to stage hunger and "blood strikes" in protest. Their release was part of a prisoner swap negotiated between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, offering the first detailed look inside a prison designed to ensure inmates never leave alive.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals a growing trend of teenagers using AI chatbots as companions for advice, friendship, and emotional support. The study found that over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many finding the interactions as satisfying as talking with human friends. While some use AI for mundane tasks, others discuss serious personal issues with it. Researchers and experts are concerned this could hinder the development of crucial social skills, critical thinking, and real-world relationships, potentially exacerbating youth loneliness and mental health crises. The unregulated AI industry is rapidly becoming a significant, and potentially problematic, part of adolescent life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first six months of President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a decade. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting an annual total over 300,000, the highest since the Obama administration in 2014. This increase reflects the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, which includes a sweeping mandate for ICE and a massive funding boost. However, this total still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational and legal challenges of such a large-scale effort.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a notable bipartisan move, three Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the motion, signaling growing pressure on the administration for transparency. The committee also voted to subpoena numerous high-profile figures, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, and several former attorneys general and FBI directors. This action follows a recent DOJ review that claimed no incriminating "client list" existed and comes as lawmakers push for greater disclosure of materials related to the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the U.S. housing market remains favorable to sellers, there are early signs of a shift that could provide some relief for homebuyers. According to real estate experts, inventory is rising, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, the highest rate since 2013. This increase in supply is causing some homes to stay on the market longer. However, prices continue to hit record highs, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low interest rates to sell. This dynamic creates a challenging environment for first-time buyers, who face intense competition and bidding wars for available properties. (not investment advice)</p>

After a tightly contested match that remained scoreless through regular time, Bonmati's skillful goal in the extra period broke the deadlock. Her performance marks a triumphant return to form and sets up a highly anticipated final, a repeat of the 2023 World Cup final.</p>

          <p>California's $21 billion wildfire insurance fund could be completely depleted by claims stemming from the devastating Eaton wildfire in Los Angeles, according to state officials. The fund was established to protect utility customers and prevent companies from bankruptcy if their equipment causes a blaze. With insured loss estimates for the fire ranging up to $45 billion, the state's Catastrophe Response Council warns that the fund's financial health is severely strained. This is especially true if investigators determine that Southern California Edison's equipment was responsible, which would make the fund liable for massive insurance claims and lawsuit settlements.</p>

Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs contributed to the slowdown, although a new trade deal may restore some confidence.
