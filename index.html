          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite is now globally unavailable on iOS after Apple blocked its attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store. This action follows a judge's ruling that Apple cannot charge commissions on purchases made outside of iOS apps. Epic Games had resubmitted Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, but Apple's rejection means Fortnite on iOS will remain offline worldwide until Apple reverses its decision. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions between Epic Games and Apple regarding App Store policies and revenue sharing.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are considering a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for older adults as part of their tax bill, framed as a 'bonus' to help retirees retain more income. This proposal serves as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, an idea previously promoted by President Trump. The deduction, applicable from 2025 to 2028, would phase out for single filers earning over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly earning over $150,000. While it offers some tax relief, experts note its impact is less significant than a tax credit, potentially saving a median income retiree less than $500 per year.</p>

The judge condemned Thibou's brazen attack in broad daylight, highlighting the devastating impact on Maximen's family, especially her daughter.

          <p>U.S. military commanders will be instructed to identify transgender troops or those with gender dysphoria within their units and subject them to medical evaluations aimed at initiating their removal from service. This process, outlined by a senior defense official, is intended to enforce the Trump administration's ban on transgender service members, following a Supreme Court decision. Commanders may expedite health assessments based on awareness of a service member's medical status, potentially leading to outing of troops who do not voluntarily come forward. The policy includes a financial incentive for voluntary departures before specific deadlines in June and July.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to meet directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin following Putin's decision to skip peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey. Trump expressed confidence that a meeting between them could lead to a resolution, stating that he would meet with Putin 'as soon as we can set it up.' The announcement comes as meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul yielded little progress, with Ukraine accusing Moscow of lacking genuine interest in a negotiated settlement. The Kremlin has indicated that any meeting between Putin and Trump would require careful preparation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East trip resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, including deals allowing American chip giants Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced chips for AI development. However, these deals are facing political pushback in the U.S., with concerns that the technology could fall into the wrong hands, potentially reaching China. Some Trump officials are reportedly considering pausing the deals due to security risks, highlighting a division within the administration on AI and technology exports. Despite the political concerns, investors have reacted positively, with shares in Nvidia and AMD soaring after the announcements.</p>

U.S. companies, including major retailers like Walmart and Target, bear the burden of these tariffs, often passing the costs onto American consumers in the form of higher prices.
