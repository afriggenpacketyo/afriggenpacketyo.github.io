In Guangdong province, more than 150,000 residents have been relocated as a precautionary measure, and extensive emergency personnel have been deployed. The storm is expected to bring powerful winds and heavy rainfall, prompting the national weather authority to issue its highest-level red alert.

          <p>This opinion article contends that President Trump's approach to Latin America lacks a coherent strategy and is characterized by impulsive, bullying tactics. The author points to the military buildup around Venezuela and threats against drug cartels as examples of actions that are more about projecting toughness than achieving clear objectives. The piece argues that these policies are backfiring by alienating allies, strengthening authoritarian leaders like Nicolás Maduro, and ultimately creating a vacuum that benefits rivals like China.</p>

          <p>As the Conservative party conference begins, UK newspaper headlines are dominated by leader Kemi Badenoch's pledge to deport 150,000 illegal migrants annually. This bold stance is presented as a way to counter the rise of Reform UK, yet some reports suggest Badenoch has a limited window to prove her leadership or face a challenge. Another prominent story involves the recent collapse of a Chinese spying case, with questions raised about the government's official stance on Beijing's status as an adversary.</p>

          <p>A new cultural trend is emerging where waiting in long queues is seen not as an inconvenience but as a desirable social experience. The article explores why people are willing to line up for hours for product launches or store openings, citing factors like the thrill of anticipation, a sense of community among fellow queuers, and the feeling of exclusivity.

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar al-Assad, but the process is facing significant criticism and challenges. The elections are being conducted indirectly through electoral colleges, not by a direct popular vote, and have been postponed in three provinces due to security concerns and political standoffs. Civil society groups have warned that the process lacks democratic legitimacy and is heavily influenced by the interim president, undermining the goal of a truly representative government.</p>

          <p>In the Hungarian city of Pecs, thousands of people, including several Members of the European Parliament, participated in a Pride march despite it being officially banned by police. The demonstration was a protest against the increasingly restrictive laws targeting the LGBTQ+ community under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. Protesters waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning the government's actions, which organizations like Amnesty International have described as having a "chilling effect" on fundamental human rights.</p>
