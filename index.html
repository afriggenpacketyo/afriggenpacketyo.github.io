          <p>Levita Almuete Ferrer, a former State Department budget analyst, pleaded guilty to stealing over $650,000 from the agency over two years. Ferrer abused her signature authority, writing checks to herself and an associate, then attempted to conceal the scheme using Quickbooks by falsifying payee information. She faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and has agreed to pay full restitution to the U.S. government. Ferrer is scheduled to be sentenced in September, marking the end of a significant breach of trust within the State Department.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the panic surrounding ultra-processed baby foods, particularly pouches, arguing it's another way to induce maternal guilt. The author, a mother herself, acknowledges dietary concerns but questions the moral judgment placed on mothers who occasionally use pouches for convenience. She contends that the focus on foodwork, often disproportionately borne by women, reinforces traditional gender roles and ignores broader social and economic inequalities. The author advocates for a society that supports parents through improved parental leave, childcare, and reduced economic pressures, rather than condemning convenient food choices.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift towards a more loyalist and less inhibited administration in his second term. The author suggests that unlike his first term, where Trump was often restrained by advisors and a resistant bureaucracy, his second term would be characterized by a court of loyalists who would not challenge his decisions. This shift, according to the article, explains the increased "ferocity and recklessness" of Trump's presidency.</p>
