Despite the EU's efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy following the invasion of Ukraine, almost 19% of its gas and LNG imports still came from Russia in 2024.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second expert testified that a Google search regarding hypothermia made by Jennifer McCabe occurred after the discovery of John O'Keefe's body, contradicting the defense's claim that it happened earlier. Jessica Hyde's testimony supported previous evidence indicating the search was conducted at 6:24 a.m., not 2:27 a.m. as the defense asserted. The expert also stated that O'Keefe's phone was not secured following established protocols, and that the jury may not have understood the technical details of the testimony.</p>
