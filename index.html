          <p>The government of Madagascar has reported an ongoing attempt to illegally seize power, as a specific army unit, CAPSAT, claims to have taken control of the military command. This development occurs amidst escalating youth-led protests against President Andry Rajoelina's government, fueled by widespread dissatisfaction over corruption, unemployment, and the rising cost of living. The CAPSAT unit, which was instrumental in Rajoelina's rise to power in 2009, has now sided with demonstrators, signaling a significant and dangerous shift in the nation's political crisis.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has sharply criticized Democratic leaders for their negotiating posture during the ongoing government shutdown, labeling their demands as "hostage-taking." The impasse, now in its twelfth day, centers on Democrats' insistence on extending expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for funding the government. While Democrats call for direct negotiations with the White House, Vance and Republican leadership maintain there is nothing to negotiate until the government is reopened, blaming the shutdown's chaos and recent federal layoffs on Democratic intransigence.

          <p>During a rare press conference in New Delhi attended by female journalists, the Taliban's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, was questioned about his government's ban on education and work for Afghan women and girls. Muttaqi claimed the prohibition on education is not a religious decree but has been "postponed" by order of the supreme leader, a statement journalists were not permitted to challenge. The event followed outrage after women journalists were barred from a male-only Taliban press conference a day earlier, which Muttaqi dismissed as a "technical issue."</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Bari Weiss's Appointment at CBS News is Culmination of a 50-Year Conservative Plan</h2>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the appointment of conservative provocateur Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is not a sudden shift but the result of a 50-year strategy to reshape American media. Citing the 1971 Powell memo, which called for corporations to exert influence over news coverage to make it more pro-business, the authors trace a historical line of media deregulation and consolidation. They argue this long-term plan, supported by media executives and political figures, aimed to transform journalism from an adversarial watchdog into a champion of corporate and political power.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a stern warning to personnel in propaganda departments and other classified units to prevent media leaks of confidential information. An official article cited several past instances where news media published state secrets, blaming a lack of confidentiality reviews and some workers' desire to pursue novelty over security. The notice emphasizes that public-facing information from state-run entities is often scrutinized by foreign powers, making lax controls a significant risk to national security and interests.</p>

          <p>The UK's education secretary has stated that the prime minister's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, had no involvement in the evidence for the recently collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges after claiming the government failed to provide necessary evidence defining China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. Conservatives have suggested Powell was behind the decision, a claim the government denies, insisting the prosecution was based on the previous government's policy.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's Mayor Gong Zheng announced that the city will eliminate all limits on foreign investment in its manufacturing sector as part of a broader push for market openness. The reforms have already granted overseas companies full market access in key areas such as electric vehicles, biotechnology, and value-added telecommunications. Gong emphasized that foreign-funded manufacturers will receive equal treatment in government procurement and will be supported in their efforts to participate in building local supply chains, reinforcing Shanghai's commitment to being an open market.

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting supremacy and discrimination has positively influenced a generation. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests fans should actively and critically interrogate the problematic elements within the canon, similar to how religious communities reinterpret flawed sacred texts, to generate positive social value.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has argued that the precedent set in 2011, when the SNP's majority win at Holyrood led to the 2014 independence referendum, should apply again if his party secures a majority in the next election. Despite UK Labour leader Keir Starmer's opposition to another poll, Swinney claims he is in a "much stronger position" to negotiate a mandate based on this historical example. The UK's Scottish Secretary, Douglas Alexander, dismissed the strategy as a diversion from the SNP's record on public services.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has publicly called for the Trump administration to follow his lead in impeaching "corrupt judges," a sentiment echoed by prominent Maga figures. This intervention comes amid what experts describe as unprecedented threats against the U.S. judiciary, with a significant increase in threats against federal judges since Trump returned to office. Critics view these rhetorical attacks as part of a broader authoritarian strategy to undermine judicial independence and subvert democratic accountability, mirroring tactics used by leaders in countries like Hungary and Turkey.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has confirmed it launched attacks on Pakistani troops at multiple border locations, claiming to have killed 58 military personnel in retaliation for an alleged Pakistani airstrike on an Afghan market. Pakistan disputes these figures, stating 23 of its soldiers were killed while neutralizing around 200 Taliban and affiliated fighters, and has condemned the Afghan attacks as "unprovoked." This significant escalation has led to the closure of major border crossings, stranding hundreds of trucks and intensifying tensions between the two neighboring countries.</p>
