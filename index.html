          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and FBI has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in August 2019 while in federal custody. The investigation found no evidence of a "client list" or that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures, despite years of conspiracy theories. Video footage confirmed he was alone in his cell, and no uncharged third parties were implicated. This article aims to provide transparency and combat unfounded theories surrounding his death.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares dropped 6.8%, wiping $79 billion off its value, as investors grew concerned over Elon Musk's decision to launch a new political party. Analysts suggest this move deepens Musk's involvement in politics, distracting him from Tesla's core business and potentially leading to a consumer backlash or White House retaliation. The decline reflects a broader "sense of exhaustion" among shareholders regarding Musk's political engagements. This article highlights the direct financial consequences of a CEO's controversial personal and political actions on their company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article questions the coherent leadership of American defense and foreign policy under the Trump administration, citing capricious presidential interest and empowered lower-level appointees. It highlights instances like halted weapons shipments to Ukraine and a review of the AUKUS pact, seemingly driven by an Undersecretary of Defense. The piece suggests a dysfunctional process, where decisions are made without clear guidance from above, leading to an "America First" sloganeering without a cohesive strategy.
