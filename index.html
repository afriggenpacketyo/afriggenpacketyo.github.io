        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Access to popular weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is increasingly becoming a wealth issue in the UK, with thousands of NHS patients reportedly missing out due to strict eligibility criteria and a "postcode lottery" for prescriptions. Over 90% of the estimated 1.5 million users pay privately, facing costs between £100-£350 monthly, and potential price hikes. Critics warn this creates a two-tier system, exacerbating health inequalities where obesity rates are higher in deprived areas. Experts suggest broader societal issues, like the food system, are overlooked by medicalizing obesity, highlighting the need for prevention and equitable access to care.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is on track to win parliamentary elections crucial for the country's EU path. With 92% of votes counted, PAS holds a significant lead over the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc, despite claims of "massive Russian interference" and bomb scares at polling stations. The election outcome is seen as pivotal for Moldova's future, as the nation grapples with the impact of the war in neighboring Ukraine, economic challenges, and high corruption. Opposition leaders have called for protests, rejecting the results and alleging harassment of pro-Moscow voters.</p>

Flash flooding and mudslides are likely in higher terrain, and the system is projected to bring two to four inches of rain, with localized totals up to seven inches, to coastal Carolinas by Wednesday morning.

          <p>The New York Mets concluded their 2025 season with a crushing 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins, officially falling out of playoff contention. Despite starting strong with a 45-24 record by June, the team finished 83-79 after a dramatic late-season collapse, including an eight-game losing streak. With the second-highest payroll in MLB, exceeding $341 million, and a massive contract for Juan Soto, the Mets' failure to reach the postseason for the seventh time in nine years has led manager Carlos Mendoza to take responsibility and promise a thorough review. The team's performance, particularly in August and September, was a significant disappointment for fans and management.</p>

          <p>A stowaway was found dead in the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight upon its arrival in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Europe. Maintenance crews discovered the individual, who was declared dead at the scene by airport division officers. Aviation experts emphasize the extreme dangers of stowing away in a plane's wheelwell, citing factors like temperatures as low as minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit and severe lack of oxygen at high altitudes. Such attempts almost invariably result in death due to the perilous conditions, with rare cases of survival being almost unheard of.</p>

          <p>Shaun Murphy, the 2005 world champion, claimed his first British Open snooker title by defeating Anthony McGill 10-7 in a captivating final. Murphy, who trailed for much of the match, took the lead in the evening session and sealed the victory by winning four consecutive frames, ending a 26-month wait for a ranking title. Despite McGill's strong challenge in his first final in eight years, Murphy's consistent performance, including eight breaks of 50-plus, proved decisive. The Englishman expressed his desire to regain consistency and emulate top players, taking home £100,000 for his win.</p>

The scheme will collaborate with private companies, which are expected to cover some wages, and will be funded from existing budgets.

          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has expressed strong disapproval of President Trump's allegations that the FBI secretly placed agents as "agitators" within the crowd during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Klobuchar, who co-led a bipartisan investigation into the insurrection, cited a report from the Office of the Inspector General finding no evidence to support such claims. FBI Director Kash Patel, nominated by Trump, clarified that 274 FBI agents were deployed for crowd control *after* the riot began, against FBI standards, but not as agitators. Klobuchar highlighted the delay in military assistance on January 6 and the injuries sustained by police officers.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened to a dangerous Category 4 major hurricane over the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph. While no immediate land watches or warnings are issued for Humberto, the storm is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents across portions of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda in the coming days. Forecasters predict Humberto will remain a major hurricane for several days, gradually weakening thereafter. This article notes Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, occurring alongside Tropical Storm Imelda, which is threatening the southeastern U.S.</p>

Speaking at a fringe meeting, Burnham emphasized the immediate peril faced by Labour in upcoming 2026 elections and criticized the party leadership's handling of dissent, citing instances of members being suspended for minor infractions. While affirming his support for the government and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's success, Burnham stressed the need for a compelling narrative that resonates with the public, warning against complacency and "simplistic statements of loyalty" in the face of gloomy opinion polls.</p>

The driver promptly alerted authorities, who responded to the child's home in Westgate. There, police discovered the mother had allegedly been held against her will and sexually assaulted multiple times by 29-year-old Glenroy Miller, sustaining broken ribs and a punctured lung. Miller has since been arrested and charged with armed kidnapping, willful injury, domestic abuse sexual assault with intent to inflict serious injuries, and obstruction of emergency communications.

          <p>President Donald Trump has warned of widespread, permanent layoffs of federal workers if a government shutdown is not averted this week, telling NBC News that his administration is prepared to "cut a lot of people." The White House's Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to prepare for mass firings, a departure from the usual practice of furloughs during shutdowns. This move would target employees in programs with discretionary funding that expires on October 1, or those deemed inconsistent with the President's priorities. Trump expressed a preference against such drastic measures but indicated readiness to act if Congress fails to reach a funding deal.</p>

However, many express concerns about her electability, citing potential obstacles like misogyny, perceived divisiveness, and media portrayal as an extremist, which could alienate swing voters. Some suggest a Senate run in 2028 might be a more strategic first step, allowing her to build experience and maintain a congressional role.
