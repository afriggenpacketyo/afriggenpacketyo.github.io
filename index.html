          <p>Penn State has reportedly fired head football coach James Franklin following a surprising upset loss to Northwestern, which marked the team's third consecutive defeat. The university allegedly owes Franklin over $49 million as part of his contract buyout, with assistant coach Terry Smith being named as the interim head coach. The decision comes as the team also announced that starting quarterback Drew Allar is out for the season due to a leg injury. Franklin's 12-season tenure concludes with a record of 104-45, including a College Football Playoff semifinal appearance last season.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback and current Fox Sports analyst Mark Sanchez has been released from an Indianapolis hospital and police custody a week after a violent altercation. Sanchez, who sustained multiple stab wounds, faces a felony charge for battery involving serious bodily injury. The incident reportedly stemmed from a parking dispute with a 69-year-old truck driver, who claims he acted in self-defense. Sanchez expressed gratitude to the medical staff who saved his life and stated his focus is on recovery and reuniting with his family.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance affirmed the Trump administration's commitment to deploying the National Guard in Chicago, despite a federal appeals court ruling that currently blocks their deployment for law enforcement duties. The administration argues federal forces are necessary to control crime, a claim disputed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who accuses the White House of overstepping its authority. This legal battle is part of a broader push to send federalized troops to several Democratic-run cities. The ongoing dispute has created tension as Chicago hosts major public events like its annual marathon.</p>

          <p>A Texas college student, Megan Ashlee Davis, is facing severe online harassment after her real mugshot was used in a fabricated viral story. The fictional post claimed a 26-year-old Olive Garden waitress was arrested for throwing breadsticks at customers, and it was shared by a Facebook page with 1.7 million followers. Despite the story being entirely false and set in a different state, users identified Davis from the photo, leading to inappropriate comments and misuse of her image. The incident highlights the damaging real-world consequences of viral misinformation and the challenges of content moderation on social media platforms.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that the Trump administration is considering all options, including invoking the Insurrection Act, to address what it describes as out-of-control crime in U.S. cities. This 1807 law would permit the deployment of active-duty military troops on U.S. soil for domestic law enforcement, a measure rarely used in modern history. The discussion arises as the administration faces legal challenges blocking the deployment of federalized National Guard troops in cities like Chicago. Critics argue this represents a significant and dangerous overreach of executive power, while violent crime rates have actually been falling in many major cities.</p>

          <p>A proposal announced by Donald Trump to impose a $100,000 fee on new H1-B visas has caused significant concern among skilled foreign workers and the technology sector. The H1-B program is heavily utilized by tech and finance companies to hire specialized talent, with proponents arguing it is essential for innovation. Critics, however, contend that corporations exploit the system to hire cheaper labor, which suppresses wages for domestic workers. The sudden proposal highlights the long-standing and complex debate over the visa program's economic impact and its role in shaping the U.S. workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

She attributes the decline to reduced business and tourist travel, as well as increased competition from autonomous vehicles like Waymo.

Key among these is not rescuing children from every struggle, as overcoming age-appropriate challenges builds resilience. Other detrimental habits include modeling perfection instead of showing how to repair mistakes, silencing big emotions, and prizing achievement over effort. The article advises that fostering autonomy through small choices and teaching the value of rest are crucial for developing emotionally healthy and self-regulating individuals who can rebound from setbacks.</p>

          <p>The trial of Maja T., a German national accused of attacking suspected right-wing extremists in Budapest, is drawing scrutiny over the state of Hungary's justice system. Germany's Constitutional Court has already raised doubts about the case, questioning whether humane detention conditions and a fair trial are possible, particularly given the politicization of the case by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The situation is contrasted with that of an Italian MEP, Ilaria Salis, who faces similar charges but is protected by parliamentary immunity, a decision that has angered Hungarian officials.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is now affecting public access to some of the nation's most treasured cultural institutions. As the political impasse in Washington continues without a clear resolution, the Smithsonian has been forced to temporarily close its museums and the National Zoo. This closure serves as a tangible and highly visible consequence of the funding lapse, impacting tourists, families, and researchers alike. The shutdown is entering its twelfth day, with both parties continuing to blame each other for the failure to reach a funding agreement.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has sharply criticized Democrats over the ongoing government shutdown, accusing them of 'hostage-taking' by refusing to fund the government without concessions on health care policy. As the shutdown enters its twelfth day, Democrats have demanded the extension of expiring health insurance tax credits, while Republican leaders insist there is nothing to negotiate until the government is reopened. Vance argued that while the administration is willing to discuss health care, it will not reward what he describes as a tactic to force policy changes by shutting down essential services.</p>

          <p>A contentious interview between Vice President JD Vance and ABC's George Stephanopoulos devolved into a heated exchange over bribery allegations against White House border czar Tom Homan. Stephanopoulos repeatedly pressed Vance on whether Homan accepted $50,000 in cash as recorded on an FBI surveillance tape. Vance deflected the questions, calling the story a 'ridiculous smear' and accusing the media of focusing on a 'bogus story' instead of the government shutdown. The interview ended abruptly after Vance accused Stephanopoulos of losing credibility by pursuing a 'weird left-wing rabbit hole.'</p>

One woman successfully sued Facebook to stop the use of her personal data for such direct marketing, though the change only applies to her. The experiences highlight the emotional distress caused by insensitive ad targeting and raise questions about the adequacy of Meta's content preference tools.</p>
