          <p>An incident involving federal immigration agents and a civilian vehicle in San Bernardino is under investigation after agents fired shots. The driver claimed masked men tried to stop him, while a DHS spokesperson stated officers were injured when the subject attempted to run them down, prompting an agent to fire in self-defense. The San Bernardino Police Department responded but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits local law enforcement from assisting with federal immigration enforcement, and left the scene. Federal authorities later arrested the man for assaulting a federal officer amid a gathering crowd.</p>

The U.S. is India's largest single export partner, making the stalled negotiations a significant concern for Indian manufacturers and the broader economic relationship.

The storm is currently lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and strong winds as it moves on a west-northwest track. While the majority of meteorological models predict Erin will remain offshore, its path between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents next week.

          <p>Researchers in China have created a new method for making biological tissues, including brains, transparent for imaging, allowing for an exceptionally clear view of their internal structures. The technique produces vivid and highly accurate three-dimensional images by preserving the tissue's original morphology while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. According to the scientists, this process creates an "ionic glassy tissue" that forms a stable, solid state at low temperatures. This innovation could significantly advance neurological research by offering unprecedented detail of the brain's complex networks.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump has indicated to European allies that he supports a peace proposal where Russia would take full control of Ukraine's Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would reportedly agree to freeze the current front lines in other occupied territories like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This marks a significant policy shift, as Trump now advocates for a direct peace agreement rather than a temporary ceasefire. The proposal presents a major challenge for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected surrendering territory and is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and base-running errors by their division rivals. The Padres committed three caught-stealing mistakes in the first two innings, while their pitcher Dylan Cease struggled with control, issuing multiple walks that led to early Dodgers runs. A costly dropped fly ball by center fielder Jackson Merrill further extended the Dodgers' lead, allowing them to clinch the head-to-head season series. The win moves the Dodgers back into sole possession of first place in the National League West.</p>

His defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia.

          <p>Chinese researchers are exploring a novel aircraft design for a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a single, rotating 'scissor wing' to optimize performance across different speeds. The concept, inspired by a NASA design from the 1970s, features a wing that sits perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient lift at low speeds. As the aircraft accelerates toward Mach 5, the wing pivots to become parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire vehicle into a 'waverider' for high-speed flight. This innovative approach aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of transitioning between subsonic, transonic, and hypersonic speeds, potentially creating a highly versatile military aircraft.</p>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those in committed relationships, risk their careers and families by having an affair. The article suggests that factors such as a lifetime of 'always being good' and repressing personal identity, perfectionism stemming from childhood trauma, and having poor emotional boundaries can create a powerful need for recoil. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can make an affair feel like a form of escape or retaliation. Finally, a recent significant loss, like the death of a parent, can trigger a re-evaluation of life priorities, making one more susceptible.</p>

          <h2>Hurricane Erin's Rapid Intensification Highlights Climate Change Impact on Storms</h2>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has become one of the fastest-strengthening Atlantic hurricanes on record, a phenomenon scientists link to warming ocean temperatures caused by climate change. The storm's wind speed increased by 85 mph in just over 24 hours, vaulting it from a Category 1 to a rare Category 5 hurricane. While it has since weakened slightly, this extreme rapid intensification is becoming more common, allowing storms to reach peak strength more easily. Erin is the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016, an unusually high number that underscores the increasing intensity of tropical cyclones in a warming world.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which included installing running water and electricity for the first time in nearly two decades. The historic fortress is now a fully equipped, off-grid retreat with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. Having successfully brought the unique property back to life, Conner has placed the private island back on the market with an asking price of £3 million.</p>

          <h2>UK Parents Share Strategies for Managing Food Costs During School Holidays</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using meticulous planning and creative cooking to feed their children affordably during the six-week summer school holidays. Strategies include stocking freezers with 'yellow sticker' reduced-price items, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to ensure food with the nearest use-by date is used first. Some parents also rely on community pantries that provide surplus food from supermarkets at a low cost. These tactics help manage the financial strain of providing extra meals at home, especially for families who rely on subsidized or free school meals during term time.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has suspended the issuance of visitor visas for individuals from Gaza, a program often used to bring critically ill children to the U.S. for medical treatment. The decision came shortly after Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, launched an online campaign falsely portraying injured Palestinian children arriving for care as a security threat. The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, a charity that facilitates these evacuations, condemned the move as 'dangerous and inhumane,' warning it will have a devastating impact on children with no other medical options. The halt was celebrated by Loomer and her supporters as a victory.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the accessories chain once a staple for tweens and teenagers, has appointed administrators for its UK and Ireland operations after struggling with declining sales and intense competition. The brand, known for its affordable jewelry, ear-piercing services, and glittery products, has found it difficult to compete with online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu. These competitors can replicate social media trends at lower prices and faster speeds. Analysts suggest that today's youth are also influenced by older social media creators and are turning to more premium brands, leaving Claire's caught in the middle. The company's 306 stores will continue trading during the process.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field after sustaining a concussion during a preseason game against the Rams. The injury occurred on the third play from scrimmage when Johnston took a helmet-to-chin hit from a Rams safety after an incomplete pass. The game was paused for several minutes while he received medical attention before being taken to a local hospital as a precaution. Johnston, who led the team with eight touchdown catches last season, was reported to be conscious and communicative after the hit. The Chargers ultimately lost the game 23-22.</p>
