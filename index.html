            <p>This article analyzes President Trump's actions through the lens of authoritarian leaders like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele and Hungary's Viktor Orbán. It argues that Trump borrows tactics from both, using Bukele's showy displays of force and Orbán's subtle manipulation of law. The author suggests that Trump's inconsistent approach could backfire, inflaming resistance to his policies. The article highlights the tension between Trump's desire for authoritarian control and the constraints of American democracy, suggesting this conflict may ultimately limit his power.</p>

            <p>President Trump is escalating his conflict with Harvard University by threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status after freezing federal funding. This action follows Harvard's rejection of White House demands to alter hiring, admissions, and teaching practices related to antisemitism. Trump accuses Harvard of pushing a political agenda and tolerating terrorist-inspired ideologies. Harvard's president defends the university's independence and free speech rights, arguing that the White House seeks to control its community, while critics call the move an attack on academic freedom.</p>

            <p>A Palestinian activist, Mohsen Mahdawi, who was arrested during an immigration interview in Vermont, is relieved he hasn't been moved out of state and thankful for the support he's received. Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident and critic of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, was detained after leading protests at Columbia University. His attorney believes the detention is based on defamatory statements and opposition to Palestinian human rights. Mahdawi's arrest follows the deportation ruling against another Palestinian activist, raising concerns about a crackdown on pro-Palestinian voices.</p>

            <p>A consumer group has filed a lawsuit against California's Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to block potential surcharges on homeowners' insurance policies. The lawsuit challenges Lara's agreement with the California Fair Plan, which would allow insurers to charge policyholders for losses suffered by the plan. Consumer Watchdog alleges that Lara violated state law by allowing this industry "bailout." The lawsuit seeks to prevent insurers from passing on costs to consumers through surcharges, arguing it does not incentivize them to write more policies in fire-prone areas.</p>
