          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Donald Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship "violates four Supreme Court precedents." She made this remark to Solicitor General D. John Sauer during arguments about whether individual federal district court judges should have the power to issue national injunctions blocking such executive actions. The case arose after Trump issued executive orders on various issues that were halted by federal district court judges. Trump defended his stance on social media, stating that birthright citizenship was not intended for vacationers.</p>

          <p>Coinbase reported that cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data for social engineering attacks, potentially costing the company up to $400 million to fix. The hackers demanded money in exchange for not publicly disclosing the stolen information, but Coinbase has refused to pay and is cooperating with law enforcement. Although passwords and private keys were not compromised, sensitive data such as names, addresses, masked bank account numbers, and government ID images were exposed. Coinbase detected the breach independently, terminated the involved employees, warned affected customers, and is offering a $20 million reward for information leading to the criminals' arrest. </p>

          <p>Walmart warned that despite recent reductions in tariffs on China, the company may still need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs are impeding Walmart's ability to maintain low prices, and these price hikes are expected to take effect later this month. CFO John David Rainey cautioned that a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels could significantly impact the company's financials and jeopardize earnings growth. Walmart is attempting to absorb some of the cost pressures to keep food prices as low as possible for consumers.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return anytime soon, citing the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks. While he didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, Powell has previously noted that tariffs are likely to slow growth and boost inflation.

The 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was attributed to increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warned that the strong rate of growth was unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and UK employer tax increases. Despite these challenges, the Labour government aims to boost the economy, and the Bank of England recently lowered interest rates.</p>

The piece advises against dramatic key changes, which were once a staple, and encourages contestants to go all-out on staging, including setting things on fire, but warns against being a mere novelty act.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the UK is in discussions with other countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for failed asylum seekers after their claims have been rejected in the UK. Starmer would not comment on which countries were involved, but Albania said it was not part of the talks. The proposals would apply only to asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected and who had no further routes of appeal in the UK, differing from the previous Conservative government's Rwanda scheme.</p>

Despite strong sales, the retailer refrained from projecting profits for its current quarter as tariff policies and pricing decisions remain in flux.

Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach. The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices, exacerbating the affordability gap.</p>
