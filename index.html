          <p>Authorities in Washington state are shifting their focus from finding Travis Decker, who is accused of killing his three daughters, to potentially recovering his remains. Decker has been wanted since June 2, when his daughters were found dead at a campground. The sheriff's office stated that there is no certain evidence that Decker remains alive or in the area, given the rugged terrain and conditions. The U.S. Marshals Service is also working to track him down if he managed to escape the region, and authorities are relying on tips from the public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that the joint U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities resulted in "total obliteration" of the program, contradicting a preliminary Pentagon report suggesting limited damage. Trump insisted that Iran's nuclear program has been set back "basically decades," claiming it's "gone for years." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's position, while Democratic Senators expressed skepticism and called for answers. Trump also expressed optimism about future U.S. and Iranian relations despite previous exchanges, likening the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan in World War II.</p>

Campaigners are advocating for a more compassionate approach to debt collection, urging councils to avoid using bailiffs. The government is considering changes to debt enforcement and payment rules, but many remain concerned about the financial strain on low-income households.</p>

While Israel demonstrated its intelligence capabilities, it failed to fully destroy Iranâ€™s nuclear program. Iran's regime proved resilient, but suffered significant damage and humiliation. The situation has sparked a factional battle within the Iranian political elite, with some seeking normalization with the West and others remaining committed to rejectionism. The U.S. and Israel may seek to bring a weakened Iran back to the negotiating table to impose limits on its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe have fallen for the fifth consecutive month in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The decline is attributed to customers switching to cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla's market share in Europe also decreased, while Chinese manufacturers doubled their market share in the region. This trend underscores Tesla's challenges in battling increasing competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese EV companies. (not investment advice)</p>
