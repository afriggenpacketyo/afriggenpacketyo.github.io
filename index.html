          <p>Rescue teams are continuing their search for more than 170 people still missing after catastrophic flash floods struck Central Texas over the July 4th holiday. The death toll has risen to at least 129, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, including at least 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic. The disaster has prompted a federal disaster declaration and drawn scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and the potential impact of budget cuts to the National Weather Service. State and local officials are now discussing improvements to emergency alert systems to prevent future tragedies of this scale.</p>

          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny is using his latest album and a 30-show concert residency to spotlight Puerto Rico's ongoing struggles with its colonial status, gentrification, and economic hardship. His music directly addresses the displacement of locals and the erosion of cultural identity, resonating deeply with residents who feel their concerns have been ignored. The artist's focus on the island's issues has elevated the conversation to a global stage, sparking hope among many Puerto Ricans that his influence could lead to meaningful change. The concerts also celebrate the island's heritage, reviving interest in traditional music and culture.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Sky achieved a significant upset, defeating the top-ranked Minnesota Lynx with a final score of 87-81.

This win marks only the second time this season that the Sky have secured back-to-back victories and is a notable success against a team with one of the best records in the league. The Lynx, led by Napheesa Collier's 26 points, have now lost two of their last three games.</p>

          <p>Relatives of those killed in the Air India Flight 171 crash are expressing their heartbreak and frustration following the release of a preliminary investigation report. The report found that the fuel supply to the Boeing 787's engines was cut off shortly after takeoff, but did not specify the cause. Family members, like the granddaughter of one victim, described the findings as incomplete and stressed the importance of knowing the root cause to find closure and a sense of justice. They feel they cannot be at peace until those responsible for the loss of 260 lives are held accountable.</p>

The performance has raised questions about coach Christian Wück's personnel choices and tactical system, particularly the high-risk, one-on-one defending. While the team advanced, the nature of the defeat highlights urgent problems that must be addressed before their quarterfinal match against a top opponent.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" offers a deeply sourced, speculative account of a second Trump presidency. Written by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf, the article reviews how the book chronicles the fictionalized restoration of Trump, fueled by public frustration and institutional failures. It examines the "what-if" scenarios that could have led to this outcome, including Democratic missteps and the galvanizing effect of Trump's legal battles on his supporters. The review notes the book's anxious tone as it catalogs Trump's hypothetical autocratic actions in office.</p>

          <h2>Expert Analysis of Air India Crash Report Suggests Chip Malfunction as a Possible Cause</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary report on the fatal Air India crash indicates that the Boeing 787's engine fuel cutoff switches were activated almost simultaneously, starving the engines of fuel. An aviation analyst, reviewing the findings, suggests a chip malfunction is a more likely cause than pilot error. The expert points to a prior service bulletin from the engine manufacturer regarding a flawed chip that could lead to signal loss and inadvertently trigger the fuel cutoff. This technical perspective offers a potential explanation for how the catastrophic failure occurred shortly after the plane's takeoff from Ahmedabad.</p>

          <p>An Arizona resident in Coconino County has died from pneumonic plague, marking the first fatal case of the disease in the county in over 18 years. Health officials have stated that the risk to the general public remains low. Pneumonic plague is the most severe and rarest form of the disease, which is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium and can be treated with antibiotics if caught early. While it was responsible for the "Black Death" in the 14th century, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that only an average of seven human cases now occur annually in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced the dismissal of criminal charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah plastic surgeon accused of faking COVID-19 vaccine cards. Dr. Moore was indicted in 2023 for allegedly destroying government-provided vaccines and distributing fraudulent vaccination cards in exchange for payments. In her announcement, Bondi stated that the doctor "gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so." The case was part of the Biden-era Justice Department's efforts to prosecute fraud related to pandemic health measures, and its dismissal signals a policy shift.</p>

The 77-year-old frontman withdrew on doctors' advice due to a systemic infection, a similar health concern that forced the band to cancel a recent show in Manchester. Lynne was said to be "heartbroken" by the decision, especially as he had previously hinted this could be the band's final performance.

The plan will affect games held in the four host cities with indoor stadiums: Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver.

French President Emmanuel Macron expressed strong disapproval and called for the preparation of credible countermeasures.

Analysts point to deregulation and a permissive stance on artificial intelligence as major drivers of market optimism, fostering growth and M&A activity.
