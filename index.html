            <p>The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime. The court stipulated that detainees must receive notice and an opportunity to seek habeas relief before deportation. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the administration's conduct and its potential impact on the rule of law. This decision comes amidst rising tensions between the president and the judiciary regarding immigration policies.</p>

            <p>Amid growing concerns over President Trump's tariffs and their impact on the economy, some Republicans in Congress are considering legislation to curb the president's authority over trade policy. Senator Chuck Grassley has introduced a bill requiring congressional notification and review of new tariffs. The proposed Trade Review Act of 2025 aims to reassert Congress's constitutional power over trade. However, the White House has indicated that the president would veto any bill restricting his power over tariffs.</p>

            <p>A community health clinic in Washwood Heath, Birmingham, is being touted as a potential model for reforming the NHS in England by shifting healthcare away from hospitals and into the community. The clinic brings together hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, social care teams, mental health professionals, and charity staff under one roof. This integrated approach aims to address social problems alongside health conditions, reducing hospital visits and improving patient outcomes. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has praised the clinic as a "pioneering service," but concerns remain about the feasibility of scaling this model nationwide.</p>

While initially swerving a direct answer on whether he might loosen his self-imposed restrictions on government borrowing, his team later insisted the fiscal rules were "iron clad".

            <p>Amid conflicting messages from the White House, President Trump stated that his sweeping tariffs can be both negotiable and permanent. He justified the tariffs as a response to a "national emergency" caused by trade deficits and unfair practices. However, the announcement has caused market slumps, and economists have increased their odds of a recession. The President's seemingly contradictory statements have left investors and foreign leaders uncertain about the future of trade relations.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to return a deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to the US. The administration argued that the Maryland judge lacked the authority to issue the order and cannot compel El Salvador to return Garcia. Garcia, who was deported due to an "administrative error", is being held in a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. His wife, a US citizen, has called for his release.</p>
