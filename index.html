          <p>Tiow-Gan Ong, a leading Taiwanese chemist with joint appointments at several international universities, has officially joined the School of Science and Engineering in Shenzhen this month. Six years prior, Ong had publicly expressed concerns about Taiwan's academic talent outflow, hoping to retain professionals on the island. His move, therefore, highlights a significant trend of scientific and academic talent migration, potentially strengthening China's research capabilities. This article details a notable individual's career transition and its broader implications for regional scientific development and competition.</p>

          <p>Datong, a city in China's Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during severe summer rains, despite nearly 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. This resilience is attributed to a major infrastructure project initiated over 15 years ago by former mayor Geng Yanbo, who widened the city's main waterway and reinforced its banks. Initially criticized as a waste due to infrequent rainfall, the investment is now recognized as crucial. Economists suggest such proactive infrastructure spending not only enhances urban resilience in the medium term but also effectively stimulates the economy in the short term, exemplified by Beijing's recent 1 trillion yuan allocation for disaster prevention.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic in Texas plans to reopen next summer, a year after flash floods in the Guadalupe River tragically killed 27 girls and counselors. The camp's reopening will adhere to new safety legislation, fiercely championed by victims' families, which mandates prohibiting cabins in dangerous flood zones, developing detailed emergency plans, and installing warning systems. The devastating floods on the Fourth of July killed at least 136 people across Texas and caused widespread destruction. Additionally, the camp will construct a memorial to honor the girls who perished, signifying a commitment to remembrance and improved safety protocols.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, has secured a congressional seat in Arizona's 7th Congressional District in a special election, following the death of her father, Raul Grijalva. Her victory further shrinks the Republican's already razor-thin House majority, which now stands at 219-214 with two remaining vacant seats. Grijalva, who becomes Arizona's first Latina in Congress, campaigned on progressive issues, including fighting against the "Big Ugly Bill" and supporting the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files. Her win in this left-leaning, Hispanic-majority district underscores the ongoing political dynamics in a crucial battleground state.</p>

          <p>An escalator carrying President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at the UN headquarters abruptly halted, followed by a teleprompter malfunction during Trump's speech to the General Assembly. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly suggested the escalator incident "doesn't look like a coincidence," calling for an investigation and referencing earlier jokes by UN staff about intentionally shutting off escalators. However, a UN spokesperson explained that a safety mechanism was triggered, possibly inadvertently by a videographer from Trump's delegation. A UN official also clarified that the White House was responsible for operating the teleprompter.</p>

Despite ABC's reinstatement, major affiliate corporations Sinclair and Nexstar refused to air the show, demanding an apology from Kimmel.
