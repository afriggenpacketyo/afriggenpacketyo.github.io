        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warnings of retail shortages are surfacing as CEOs express concerns about a prolonged trade war with China. The article suggests that apparel and footwear will be among the first product categories affected due to the high percentage of imports from China. Companies are expecting impacts such as price increases and consumer wariness, and supply chain experts believe that lower-end stores will be hit hardest by tariffs on low-cost imports. The next several months will be critical in determining the health of the supply chain as experts monitor port container volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, known as a "dirty line." This line lacks the firewall protections of the Defense Department's systems, potentially making it vulnerable to monitoring, especially if sensitive information is communicated. Hegseth has denied sharing classified war plans over Signal, despite questions about sharing information with a group including his wife, who is not a government employee. The Pentagon spokesperson stated that Hegseth does not use Signal on his government computer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump insists that negotiations to end the war in Ukraine are making progress, despite a deadly Russian strike on Kyiv. Trump issued a rare public rebuke of Vladimir Putin, demanding he "STOP!" the strikes, but indicated no immediate penalties. The Trump administration has been pushing for a peace settlement that would recognize Russian control over seized Ukrainian land, including Crimea, a proposal facing resistance from Ukrainian leaders. The administration maintains flexibility in negotiations, aiming to save lives and end the conflict.</p>

The White House claims this establishes the U.S. as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration and development.

Zinsner made these remarks during the company's quarterly earnings call, despite Intel reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results due to customers stockpiling chips ahead of tariffs. However, the company's guidance for revenue and profit fell below expectations, pushing the chipmaker's stock down.

          <p>Police shot and killed an armed 30-year-old man at Toronto's Pearson International Airport after responding to a "dispute." Officers spent about 10 minutes attempting to de-escalate the situation before the man "abruptly" withdrew a gun, leading officers to open fire. The incident caused temporary road closures around the terminal, but flights continue to operate normally. The Special Investigations Unit is investigating the shooting, and Ontario Premier Doug Ford condemned the incident.</p>

The sequel's plot, involving human trafficking, is deemed less engaging, and the script is described as clunky and banal, with too little math and too much reliance on jokey scenes.</p>
