        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales experienced a steeper-than-expected decline of 0.9% in May, according to the Commerce Department, signaling a pullback in consumer spending. This decline, which followed a 0.1% loss in April, exceeded the Dow Jones consensus expectation of a 0.6% drop. While building materials and gasoline sales contributed to the downturn, online sales and furniture stores saw gains. Excluding a series of volatile items, sales increased 0.4%, and that reading, known as the control group, is what the department uses when calculating gross domestic product. The overall trend suggests a cautious consumer sentiment amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to China expert William Figueroa, China's stance on the conflict between Iran and Israel mirrors its approach to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing dialogue and de-escalation while placing blame on Israel. China lacks the capability for power projection in the Middle East and views the conflict as posing a risk to its energy security. Figueroa believes China will continue to facilitate regionally initiated efforts, rather than directly mediating, due to the high costs and low potential gains involved, and this means China has no appetite to be involved. The article suggests that China's influence in the conflict is limited, despite its economic ties with Iran.</p>
