          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecasts for the United States more significantly than for China, citing escalating trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The US economic growth is now projected at 1.8%, a 0.9 percentage point decrease from January's forecast, while global economic growth estimate has been cut by 0.5 percentage points to 2.8%. The IMF also revised up US inflation by 1 percentage point to 3%, attributing it to persistent price dynamics in the services sector and the impact of recent tariffs.</p>

          <p>Bath & Body Works is benefiting from a significant tariff advantage because it produces 80% of its products in the United States, a strategic shift made over the past decade. This domestic focus allows the company to avoid import tariffs, maintain stable prices, and enhance its responsiveness to consumer trends. The company's primary U.S. manufacturing facility, Beauty Park, has reduced production lead times, improving efficiency and minimizing the need for discounts. Analysts believe this advantage positions Bath & Body Works for revenue growth after a period of sales decline since 2021.</p>

          <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asserts that the Trump administration's deregulatory actions will not negatively impact public health or the environment, emphasizing the need to balance environmental protection with economic growth. The EPA is reconsidering regulations across various sectors, including power plants and oil and gas development, aiming to unleash American energy. However, critics, including former EPA employees, argue that these rollbacks could increase air pollution, leading to premature deaths and health issues.</p>
