          <p>An explosion at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant has resulted in at least one fatality, ten injuries, and one employee remaining unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred Monday morning in the "reversing room" of a coke oven battery, prompted a large-scale emergency response and an active search and rescue operation. While the plant has been stabilized, the Allegheny County Health Department has advised nearby residents to shelter in place as a precaution, although air quality monitors have not yet detected dangerous pollutant levels. The event has drawn statements of concern and support from local and state officials.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods by signing an executive order that extends the deadline for another 90 days. The tariffs were scheduled to revert to peak levels on Tuesday, but this delay provides more time for trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. This move is the latest in a series of unpredictable trade policy shifts, which have included multiple pauses and alterations to tariff implementations. The extension follows a recent request from President Trump for China to significantly increase its purchases of U.S. soybeans to help reduce the trade deficit.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its dial-up internet service, a technology that introduced many households to the web in the 1990s, effective September 30. The service, known for its distinctive connection sound, has been largely replaced by broadband, with fewer than 300,000 U.S. users remaining as of 2023. At its peak, AOL boasted over 30 million subscribers and was a dominant force online before its influence waned following the rise of faster internet alternatives and a widely criticized merger with Time Warner. The company, now owned by Apollo Global, stated it is discontinuing the service to focus on the modern digital landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium producers, including U.S.-based Albemarle, surged on Monday after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The suspension was due to an expired permit, and the company is currently working to renew it. This specific mine is a significant player, accounting for an estimated 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025. The production halt has intensified investor expectations of rising lithium prices, as the global supply was already anticipated to be in a tight balance with demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Myanmar Quake Study Suggests California's Next Major San Andreas Fault Rupture Could Be Unpredictable</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study on a major earthquake in Myanmar suggests that the next significant earthquake on California's San Andreas fault may not follow historical patterns. Researchers from Caltech analyzed a magnitude 7.7 quake that ruptured a surprisingly long 317-mile section of the Sagaing fault, which is geologically similar to the San Andreas. The findings imply that faults do not rupture in a predictable, repeatable manner, and a future California quake could be longer or occur in smaller, separate events. This highlights the complexity of seismic forecasting and underscores the need for preparedness for a wide range of possible earthquake scenarios.</p>

The company expects revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million, a significant decrease from the $87.2 million reported in the same period last year. CEO Thomas Siebel called the results "completely unacceptable," attributing the poor performance to the disruptive effects of the reorganization and his own health issues, which limited his involvement in sales. The company is also actively searching for a new CEO following Siebel's recent health diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty with fluctuating inflation and interest rates, certificates of deposit (CDs) present a stable alternative to the volatile stock market for some savers. This article outlines the potential interest earnings on a $50,000 CD across various terms, from three months to five years, based on current high rates. For instance, a one-year CD could yield approximately $2,200, while a five-year term could generate over $11,000 in predictable, FDIC-insured returns. This makes CDs a potentially viable option for those prioritizing security over higher-risk growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks, including Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands, experienced a significant rally on Monday after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. The potential move from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug would have major implications, such as easing tax burdens and encouraging institutional investment in the industry. Trump stated a determination would be made in the coming weeks on the complex subject. While the reclassification process technically falls to the Attorney General, the president's public support has fueled optimism for what could be a "game changer" for the cannabis market.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to a unique arrangement with the U.S. government, sharing 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal, brokered by the Trump administration, allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, respectively, to the crucial Chinese market. Analysts view the move as unusual but a net positive for the companies, as 85% of revenue is preferable to zero.

CEO Adam Aron attributed the success to a recovering box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and record-high revenue per patron.

The author argues this decision was a mistake, as it allows the party in power to effectively rig elections by choosing their voters, which undermines the principle of equal protection.

He praised Tan's leadership, citing his successful turnaround of Cadence Design Systems, and called him the best person to transform Intel's fortunes.

The focus will likely be on a long-term project, building a competitive team while retaining homegrown talent.</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $5 billion to overhaul its electric vehicle production, aiming to manufacture more affordable models, including a new midsize truck starting at $30,000. The investment includes $2 billion to modernize its Louisville plant and $3 billion for a new Michigan battery facility. The company's new "universal EV platform" features a novel "assembly tree" structure and uses 20% fewer parts, which could speed up production by up to 40%. The first vehicle from this new system, a four-door electric truck, is set to debut in 2027, representing a major step in making EVs more accessible to the mass market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a five-step guide for individuals whose bank accounts have been frozen by a debt collector, a legal but jarring collection tactic. The first step is to contact the bank to confirm the freeze and gather information about the court order behind it. Subsequently, individuals should review the judgment for errors, identify and claim any legally exempt funds like Social Security, and consider negotiating a settlement directly with the collector. For overwhelming debt, exploring professional debt relief options or consulting a bankruptcy attorney may be the most effective path to regaining financial control.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger has launched an investigation into the recent $5 million auction of the largest known piece of Mars found on Earth, claiming it may have been illegally smuggled out of the country. The 54-pound meteorite was discovered in the Sahara Desert in Niger in 2023 and sold by Sotheby's in New York. While the auction house insists the meteorite was exported legally, Nigerien authorities have suspended all exports of meteorites and are exploring legal avenues under international heritage law. The case highlights the ambiguity in laws governing celestial objects and whether they qualify as protected cultural property.</p>

          <p>Despite winning the FA Cup, Crystal Palace has been demoted from the Europa League to the less prestigious Conference League for breaching multi-club ownership rules. The punishment came after the club missed a UEFA deadline to restructure its ownership ties with French club Lyon. While the decision is a blow, football pundit Chris Sutton suggests it might not negatively affect the players and could even serve to "galvanise" the team. The ruling confirms Nottingham Forest's promotion into the Europa League spot, while Palace will now face a play-off round in the third-tier European competition.</p>

          <p>German sportswear giant Adidas has issued a public apology after being accused of cultural appropriation for its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe. The design, created by US designer Willy Chavarria, was inspired by traditional "huarache" sandals from the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, who were not involved in the project. The issue drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the governor of Oaxaca, who emphasized that the design is protected cultural heritage. Under a 2022 Mexican law, unauthorized use of Indigenous cultural property is a punishable offense.</p>

He characterized the summit as a "feel-out meeting" and said he would first speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky out of respect.

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that gold will not be subject to tariffs, effectively overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs ruling had stated that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would face the country's 39% tariff rate, which caused the price of gold to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures dropped by 2.48%. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had previously warned that the tariffs could negatively impact the international flow of physical gold, a concern now alleviated by the president's intervention.</p>

Dohmke will stay on through the end of the year to assist with the transition, and GitHub will continue to operate within Microsoft's CoreAI group. Despite the new competition, GitHub's AI tool, Copilot, continues to grow, with 20 million users reported in the last quarter.</p>

He contrasted it with Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell chip, stating he would not approve its sale to China without significant performance reductions.
