            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, despite a Supreme Court order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return after an acknowledged administrative error led to his deportation. Bukele questioned how he could "smuggle a terrorist" into the U.S., referring to Abrego Garcia, who is currently held in a Salvadoran prison. Top Trump administration officials also indicated they might not comply with a judge's demand to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, arguing they have no legal responsibility and federal courts lack the power to compel his return. The administration claims Abrego Garcia is a gang member, though his lawyers deny this and state he has never been charged with any crimes.</p>

            <p>For the first time, a female Army Ranger competed in the annual Best Ranger Competition, finishing the grueling three-day event and placing 14th overall. First Lt. Gabrielle White and her teammate, Capt. Seth Deltenre, were among the teams that completed the competition, which includes helicopter missions, physical fitness tests, and land navigation. Female soldiers were not allowed to be Army Rangers until 2015, and White's participation marks a significant milestone.</p>

            <p>A group of small businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging the legality of new tariffs imposed on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that Trump has illegally usurped Congress' power to levy tariffs by claiming trade deficits constitute an emergency. The businesses contend that trade deficits are not an emergency and do not constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat, further arguing that the Trump administration imposed tariffs even on countries with which the United States does not have a trade deficit.</p>

Despite the court ordering the administration to "facilitate" Garcia's return, the U.S. and El Salvador are seemingly claiming they lack the power to do anything. Trump's administration has previously floated the idea of deporting American citizens convicted of violent crime to El Salvador, raising further concerns about due process.</p>
