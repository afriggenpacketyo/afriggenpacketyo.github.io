          <p>Ahead of a planned U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, key European leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others have issued a joint statement demanding Ukraine's inclusion in any peace talks. They emphasized that Ukraine's sovereignty and internationally recognized borders must be respected and that any agreement reached without Kyiv's participation would be illegitimate. The statement comes amid concerns that the U.S. might broker a deal with Russia that could involve territorial concessions, a proposal Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that the field of robotics could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as a robot's ability to perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in an entirely new environment without prior specific training for that location. While hardware is advancing, Wang stated that the crucial missing piece is more sophisticated "AI for embodied intelligence," suggesting current models are insufficient and new approaches like generative world models may be key.</p>

          <p>The murder conviction of Matthew Ecker for the 2022 shooting death of nurse Alexandra Pennig hinged on a small, crucial piece of evidence. Ecker claimed Pennig took her own life after locking herself in the bathroom, and that he broke the door down afterward. However, investigators found a metal piece from the door's lock underneath Pennig's body, indicating the door was forced open before she was shot and fell. This discovery contradicted Ecker's narrative and became the cornerstone of the prosecution's case, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills are being asked by city officials to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage. The disruption began when a critical water control valve broke, affecting approximately 9,200 households during a heatwave. Officials explained that continued water use is depleting pressure in the system and delaying complex repairs on the underground valve, pushing back the timeline for full service restoration and lifting a boil water advisory.</p>

          <p>Recent deadly floods in Beijing have raised questions about their severity and characteristics compared to previous events.

The event marks the fifth significant flooding disaster to strike northern China since 2012, highlighting recurring challenges during the region's traditional rainy season.</p>
