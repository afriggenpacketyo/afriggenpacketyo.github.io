          <p>China is undertaking a monumental infrastructure project, the Xinjiang-Tibet railway, dubbed a "project of the century" due to its extreme engineering challenges and massive cost. The 1,980km line will traverse treacherous terrain, including mountain ranges and permafrost at high altitudes, connecting the two strategic autonomous regions. With an estimated investment reaching up to 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), it stands as one of China's most expensive rail projects, highlighting Beijing's focus on enhancing connectivity and control in its western territories.</p>

The warning follows weeks of anti-government protests, initially sparked by water and power cuts, which have escalated into broader demands for political change.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed doubling tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at tackling global overproduction and protecting its struggling domestic industry. The decision is seen as both a protectionist measure, drawing criticism from China, and a strategic maneuver to seek trade concessions from the United States, which recently imposed similar tariffs. While the European Steel Association hailed the policy as a "lifeline," the move raises concerns about its impact on trade partners like the U.K. and India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Car dealers across China are facing a severe financial squeeze, with many operating at significant losses and struggling with negative cash flow due to an intense industry price war and competition from e-commerce. According to the China Passenger Car Association, the 14 largest dealership groups saw a 10% sales decline in the first half of 2025, following an 18% drop in 2024. Industry experts are now urging banks to provide support to the approximately 30,000 dealers to stabilize the market and prevent widespread business failures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has begun the gradual rollout of its new digital border control system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will affect non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. The system replaces passport stamping with a digital record, requiring travelers to register biometric data like fingerprints and a facial photo upon their first entry into the 29-country Schengen Area. While designed to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, concerns have been raised about potential delays and queues as the system is phased in over the next six months.</p>

          <p>China has strongly criticized the United States for employing "double standards" after President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and export controls on critical software. Beijing defended its own recently announced export limits on rare earth minerals as necessary for national security, arguing they will have a limited impact on global supply chains. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce warned that it would take resolute measures to protect its interests if the U.S. proceeds, threatening to reignite a major trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Indiana jury has found Alison Davis not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, who died from severe head trauma at the bottom of their home's staircase in 2023. Prosecutors argued the injuries were inconsistent with a fall and that Alison had beaten him to death, pointing to inconsistencies in her story. However, the defense successfully countered with expert testimony suggesting a single, tragic fall could have caused the multiple skull fractures, and the lack of a murder weapon created reasonable doubt, leading to the acquittal after 17 months of incarceration.</p>

          <p>This article outlines key challenges the Los Angeles Dodgers will face against the Milwaukee Brewers in the upcoming National League Championship Series. The Brewers, despite a much smaller payroll, have built a successful team identity around a "small-ball" offense that excels at getting on base and putting pressure on defenses. Their formidable pitching staff, which ranked second in the majors in team ERA and twice swept the Dodgers in the regular season, presents a significant hurdle, featuring ace Freddy Peralta and a deep, effective bullpen.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, the former superintendent of Los Angeles schools, is planning to challenge Mayor Karen Bass in the 2026 election, becoming her first serious opponent. Beutner is launching his campaign by heavily criticizing the city's response to the devastating Palisades fire, which he calls a "failure of leadership" that personally affected his family. As a well-known philanthropist and former investment banker, Beutner's entry into the race could significantly reshape the political landscape and attract other high-profile candidates to challenge the incumbent mayor.</p>

In a social media post, Trump stated he would not allow Democrats to hold the military "hostage," placing blame on them for the failure to agree on a spending plan. The move comes as hundreds of thousands of other federal employees are either furloughed or working without pay, and the administration has begun laying off thousands of workers.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, is airing a new television series titled "Silent Honour," which marks a rare official acknowledgment and commemoration of the Communist Party's espionage activities in Taiwan. The drama chronicles the stories of clandestine agents sent to the island starting in 1949, many of whom were captured and executed by the Kuomintang. This state-guided production represents a significant shift from Beijing's previous silence on these failed covert operations, reframing them as patriotic sacrifices for the nation.</p>
