          <p>Pope Francis, who passed away at 88 from a stroke and irreversible heart failure, had prepared his last will and testament on June 29, 2022, expressing his wishes for his burial. He requested to be interred in the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary where he often prayed after his travels. The will specified a simple tomb in the side nave, bearing only his name, 'Franciscus', without any mention of his papacy. The Pope also offered his suffering for world peace and brotherhood, entrusting his life to the Virgin Mary. Optimism score: 5</p>

          <p>A minke whale died from domoic acid poisoning linked to a toxic algal bloom in Southern California, joining hundreds of affected sea lions and dolphins. Test results confirmed high levels of domoic acid in the whale's urine, consistent with other marine mammals affected since February. The algal bloom, the result of an upswell and potentially exacerbated by climate change and runoff from recent fires, has caused seizures and comatose states in marine animals. Experts advise people not to interact with sick animals and while the event is severe, the overall marine mammal population is not expected to be significantly impacted. Optimism score: 50</p>

Harvard argues the funding freeze violates its constitutional rights and academic independence, impeding critical research. The Trump administration's actions are framed as part of a broader effort to punish Harvard for protecting its rights, though the administration has said it is acting to combat anti-semitism on campuses.
