          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce stated that there are no current trade negotiations with the U.S., dismissing claims of progress as baseless. This announcement followed indications from the White House about easing tensions. China insists that the U.S. must first remove all unilateral tariffs for discussions to proceed, reinforcing its stance that the U.S. is solely responsible for de-escalating the conflict. The official line remains that China is willing to engage in talks if treated as an equal. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the losses, the fund's value remains substantial at 18.53 trillion kroner, with a significant portion invested in equities. The fund expressed that it was significantly impacted by market fluctuations and currency movements, which had a negative impact on the fund's value.</p>

This attack occurred amidst strained relations between Ukraine and the U.S., with the Trump administration echoing Kremlin talking points and pausing military aid, reversing previous U.S. policy.

This visit is especially significant as Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. has soured under President Trump, who has criticized Zelensky and paused military aid. For South Africa, the visit is equally important as it faces pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>China has denied any ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, dismissing claims of progress as lacking "factual basis." This denial follows signals from US President Donald Trump about potentially easing tariffs. China's Ministry of Commerce reiterated that the US must eliminate all unilateral tariffs for talks to occur. Analysts interpret this as a reaffirmation of China's stance that the US bears responsibility for resolving the trade conflict.</p>

          <p>Japan will implement a revised road traffic law from April 2026, imposing fines for minor traffic violations by cyclists, such as using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights. The new law allows police to issue "blue tickets" for over 100 violations to individuals aged 16 and older. This measure aims to reduce accidents involving cyclists, especially following a rise in bicycle commuting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fines range from 3,000 to 12,000 yen depending on the violation.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard economist, suggests the odds of a US recession are high due to various economic indicators and Trump's tariff policies. Declining consumer and business confidence, along with prediction market data, point to a potential downturn. While some measures like unemployment remain stable, early measures of economic activity show signs of contraction. Frankel puts the odds of a US recession as high as 60% for the coming year.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's actions, including sharing sensitive details on unsecured channels, have contributed to an escalating U.S. military campaign in Yemen. The operation, aimed at stopping Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, has involved significant military resources and expenditures. Despite the effort, the U.S. has not restored regular traffic through the sea lane and has faced costly setbacks. The bombing campaign has resulted in civilian casualties and the loss of military assets.</p>
