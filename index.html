          <p>China's military has disclosed specifications of its Type 094 nuclear submarine for the first time since it entered service in 2007. The sea-based nuclear deterrent is said to have a submerged displacement of 11,000 tonnes, a maximum speed of 30 knots, and the ability to operate at a maximum depth of 400 meters. This information was revealed during events marking the PLA Navy‚Äôs 76th anniversary, differing from previous estimates that placed the submarine's submerged displacement at 9,000 tonnes, speed at 20 knots, and operating depth at 300 meters. The Type 094 submarine carries JL-2 ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads that have a range of about 7,000km.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's actions in his second term's first 100 days closely align with Project 2025, a conservative manifesto aimed at consolidating power in the executive branch. Many individuals associated with the project now hold prominent roles in the Trump administration, implementing plans they developed within the project. Trump has taken actions like dismantling the Department of Education and ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs government-wide. While Project 2025 served as a blueprint, Trump's administration has, in some cases, gone even further, signaling a more aggressive approach to reshaping the federal government and society according to conservative principles.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has launched a pressure campaign called ‚ÄúFight to Save Medicaid‚Äù targeting vulnerable Republican members of Congress, including Don Bacon, Mike Lawler, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Tom Barrett, who represent districts carried by Kamala Harris or narrowly won by Trump. The campaign aims to derail a bill that may slash the social safety net to pay for tax cuts, organizing town halls and encouraging voters to contact their representatives. The bill could reduce government spending by $1.5 trillion, potentially cutting Medicaid by $800 billion and SNAP by $200 billion, leading to criticism from Democrats who insist that representatives must serve the people and not ignore them. </p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans believe the country would benefit from increased manufacturing jobs, even if they personally wouldn't want to work in a factory. The article argues that the decline of manufacturing has led to social and economic decline, and that reindustrialization could improve wages and overall national health. While some argue that service jobs could replace manufacturing jobs with proper unionization, the article contends that manufacturing offers greater potential for productivity growth and higher wages. The piece concludes that reindustrialization is not only economically beneficial but also politically advantageous, offering a path for the left to regain working-class support. </p>

Supporters trust his cabinet and urge patience, believing that short-term challenges are necessary for long-term gains. They also expressed strong support for Elon Musk's efforts to streamline the federal government, reflecting a desire for efficient and fiscally responsible governance.</p>

          <p>After Donald Trump's election, initial public support for his agenda has waned significantly, with disapproval rising on key issues such as the economy, trade, and immigration. The public's negative reaction to Trump's tariffs, particularly after the ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù announcement, has driven down his economic approval ratings. While some of Trump's positions may still resonate with certain segments of the population, the overall trend indicates a growing dissatisfaction with his administration's policies. The shift suggests potential challenges for Republicans in upcoming midterm elections and highlights the risk of overestimating public appetite for major change.</p>

He was granted bail and is scheduled to appear at the Old Bailey on May 30, acknowledging his bail conditions. The comedian and actor denies all charges, stating he has never engaged in nonconsensual activity and looks forward to defending himself in court.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, defying expectations for a decrease, while core inflation rose to 2.7%. Despite the lack of decline, analysts suggest that the door remains open for further interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB), particularly if US tariffs impact activity and the labor market weakens. ECB President Christine Lagarde has emphasized the bank's data-dependent approach to interest rate decisions, acknowledging uncertainties such as potential retaliation against US tariffs and Germany's infrastructure package. The central bank last cut interest rates in the previous month, reducing its key rate to 2.25%.</p>

          <p>Despite the initiation of cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine, civilian deaths have increased significantly, according to U.N. officials and analysts. Since the talks began in February, Russian missile and drone strikes have resulted in far more civilian casualties compared to the same period last year, with a 46 percent increase in April alone. While analysts suggest that increased violence is common during cease-fire negotiations as warring parties jockey for advantage, the attacks have left Ukrainians feeling vulnerable and skeptical about the prospects for peace. The Trump administration initiated the cease-fire talks on Feb. 12 with phone calls to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has refuted claims that ICE agents are removing children from elementary schools, labeling such reports as "fake news." DHS clarified that ICE agents were present at specific schools for reasons unrelated to immigration enforcement, such as investigating potential child sex trafficking and conducting wellness checks on unaccompanied children. The agency emphasized its commitment to protecting children and reuniting them with their families, contrasting its approach with that of the previous administration. DHS credited the reunification of nearly 5,000 unaccompanied children with relatives or safe guardians to the efforts of Secretary Noem and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The group did not immediately attribute the attack to any specific nation or group.

The agency specifically stated that the AfD does not consider citizens of a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries" as equal members of the German people.

          <h2>Reform Party Gains Ground in Local Elections, Bruising Tories and Leaving Labour to Strategize</h2>

          <p>The Reform Party, led by Nigel Farage, is proving to be a threat to both the Conservatives and Labour, as demonstrated by their victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election and strong performances in other local contests. While Reform squeaked over the line in the by-election, their share of the vote in other key tussles shows a significant impact, often stacking up between a fifth and a third of the vote. This is a particularly bleak day for the Conservatives, who are bracing for more grim news, and the government is recalibrating its focus on delivery, with immigration plans, the spending review, and the defence review all coming before the summer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order calling for all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) to be blocked, alleging that both organizations have engaged with "biased and partisan news coverage." The order instructs the board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, who distributes funding to PBS and NPR stations, to "cease direct funding" to the "maximum extent allowed by law." The White House has stated that funding of news media is "not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence."</p>

          <p>The latest jobs report is expected to provide insight into the performance of the U.S. economy following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement. Economists anticipate a slowdown in job growth, with an estimated 133,000 jobs added in April, down from 228,000 in the previous month. The data follows a report indicating that the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of 2025, partly due to uncertainty caused by Trump's tariff proposals. Despite concerns, the labor market has remained relatively strong, with an average of 170,000 jobs added each month this year and a historically low unemployment rate.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump are expected to meet at the White House, aiming to find common ground despite strained relations between the US and Canada. While Trump has shown a distaste for Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, there is hope that the new Canadian leader's business acumen and Ivy League background may appeal to the US president. Despite this, Canada faces challenges in navigating Trump's protectionist policies, with the US president expected to push for stricter border controls and a more balanced trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Comedian and actor Russell Brand appeared in a London court on multiple charges of sexual assault, including two counts of rape, marking the first step in what are likely to be lengthy criminal proceedings. The charges relate to alleged offenses between 1999 and 2005, involving four women. Brand, who denies all charges, was asked to confirm his name, address, and date of birth but did not enter a plea. A plea hearing is expected in about a month, but the actual trial might not begin for a year due to a backlog of cases.</p>

          <p>American consumers are beginning to feel the effects of President Trump's trade policies as companies warn of impending price increases on various products, including strollers, mattresses, and kitchenware. Companies cite higher import costs as the reason for raising prices, while others have paused orders from China due to tariffs. Despite Trump scaling back some tariffs, economic studies suggest that the burden of higher tariffs typically falls on domestic consumers and companies. A secretary in Washington state noted that import fees tacked onto her Temu order have increased significantly, leading her to abandon the platform.</p>

The letter, a love letter to a nation torn by hate, advocates for love and nonviolent pressure to overcome injustice, drawing inspiration from Christian faith. Eig argues that the letter provides guidance for those who disapprove of current tactics, including deportations and cuts to education, and encourages actions such as peaceful protests and economic boycotts to challenge unjust policies.</p>
