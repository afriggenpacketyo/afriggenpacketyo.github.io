          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has disrupted Democratic efforts to reassess his presidency and 2024 candidacy. The news prompted an outpouring of sympathy, but also raised questions about the timing of the announcement and whether his health was concealed during his time in office. Former Representative Dean Phillips suggested the announcement was strategically timed to deflect criticism, while others, including physicians, questioned if Biden knew about his condition earlier. Despite the concerns, Biden expressed gratitude for the support and shared a photo with his wife, Jill, on social media, showing optimism. (nytimes.com)</p>

          <p>Portugal's recent general election, the third in three years, has not yielded a stable government, resulting in another minority government for the center-right Democratic Alliance.

The agreements required painful concessions, reflecting Britain's status as a midsize economy squeezed between global trade giants. While the deals offer benefits, they also highlight the challenges Britain faces in a world dominated by larger trading blocs and characterized by protectionist policies. (nytimes.com)</p>
