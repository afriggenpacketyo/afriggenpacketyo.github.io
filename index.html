          <p>Senators Pete Ricketts and John Fetterman are joining forces on bipartisan legislation aimed at increasing oversight of foreign countries acquiring American farmland. The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure (AFIDA) Improvements Act seeks to address concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) regarding the current system's inadequacy in monitoring foreign ownership, particularly by China. The bill mandates AFIDA reporting for foreign entities with more than one percent interest in American agricultural land, enhancing information sharing and establishing a deadline for USDA to set up an online AFIDA system. This legislative effort reflects growing concerns about food security and national security related to foreign investment in U.S. agriculture. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of U.S. gun manufacturers, blocking a lawsuit filed by the Mexican government seeking to hold them liable for the trafficking of weapons across the border. Mexico argued that American firearms manufacturers were aiding and abetting the illicit flow of guns, contributing to cartel violence, and sought $10 billion in damages and safety measures. Justice Elena Kagan stated that federal law grants broad immunity to U.S. gun companies, protecting them from Mexico's claims, as the lawsuit did not plausibly allege the kind of participation needed to make an aiding-and-abetting charge. The decision marks the first time the high court has weighed in on gunmaker immunity. </p>

The petition challenges Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s review of mifepristone, which cited flawed data questioning its safety. The states argue no new scientific data justifies altering the conclusion that mifepristone is safe and effective, asserting the FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for the drug is medically unjustified. </p>

          <p>Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel's, saw its shares plummet by over 18% after reporting quarterly earnings below analyst estimates, citing tariff uncertainty and weak discretionary spending on alcohol.

Brown-Forman anticipates a challenging operating environment for fiscal year 2026 due to macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility and potential tariff impacts. This decline reflects broader concerns about the impact of tariffs on the alcohol industry and consumer spending. </p>

          <p>Florida schools are facing a significant rise in student absences since the pandemic, with nearly one million students missing more than three weeks of school last year. This chronic absenteeism is undermining academic success, with 31% of students missing 10% or more of the school year, compared to 20% before the pandemic. Educators attribute this trend to disrupted attendance habits and new hardships faced by families, particularly those living in poverty. The state's lack of a comprehensive approach has left districts struggling to address the issue, which is contributing to falling test scores and long-term educational challenges. </p>

The court's unanimous decision upholds a 2005 law shielding gun manufacturers from liability if their products are misused. Mexico had argued that the flood of illegal guns across the border resulted from deliberate practices by US firms appealing to cartel members, but the court found the complaint did not plausibly allege the manufacturers aided and abetted unlawful sales.

While this collapse cut the trade deficit, analysts caution against interpreting it as entirely positive, as international trade has generally benefited the US economy. </p>
