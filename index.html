          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Vladimir Putin is not preparing for peace but is instead readying new offensive operations, despite an upcoming U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska. This warning comes as Russian troops reportedly achieved a significant breakthrough on the eastern front, advancing several miles and threatening key Ukrainian defensive positions. The summit, which Ukrainian representatives are not expected to attend, is being approached with skepticism by Kyiv, which maintains it will not cede territory or its NATO aspirations.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants arriving in the UK via small boat crossings of the English Channel is expected to surpass 50,000 since the Labour party came into power last summer. Government officials acknowledge the number is unacceptably high but point to a new returns deal with France as a potential deterrent. The Conservative opposition has criticized the Labour government, claiming it has surrendered border control and is overseeing an unprecedented illegal immigration crisis. This issue remains a key challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who pledged to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.</p>

          <p>The parents of Harvey Willgoose, a 15-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed by a fellow student at a Sheffield high school, are publicly calling for the court to lift the anonymity order protecting his 15-year-old killer. Following the guilty verdict for murder, Harvey's mother expressed that her son was named throughout the trial while the defendant was not, and she feels his name has been tarnished. The family is also advocating for increased school safety measures, such as knife arches, to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season later in the week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is currently moving west, with early models suggesting it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its formation marks the fifth named storm of what NOAA predicts will be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season. The storm has already caused flooding in Cabo Verde, leading to a state of emergency declaration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn that lung cancer is a grossly undercounted and misdiagnosed disease across sub-Saharan Africa, creating a hidden epidemic. While official statistics suggest low mortality rates outside of South Africa, this is likely due to a lack of diagnostic resources, with many cases mistaken for tuberculosis. The region's cancer burden is projected to more than double by 2050, yet it receives minimal global health funding for non-communicable diseases. Systemic challenges, including rising smoking rates and limited healthcare capacity, hinder early detection and treatment, making prevention a critical but difficult strategy.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Delays Re-imposition of High Tariffs on Chinese Goods for 90 Days</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 07:18:38 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration has extended the deadline to reimpose high tariffs on Chinese goods by another 90 days, temporarily averting an escalation in the trade war between the two nations. The decision, which came hours before the previous pause expired, was an expected outcome following recent negotiations in Stockholm. This move continues a pattern of unpredictable trade policy, providing short-term relief for businesses but maintaining uncertainty in the long-term economic relationship between the U.S. and China.

          <p>Former NBA player Sebastian Telfair is set to report to prison for a six-month sentence after violating the terms of his supervised release related to a healthcare fraud case. Before beginning his sentence, Telfair made a public plea to President Donald Trump for a pardon, claiming the situation stems from a paperwork issue and is profoundly unfair. Telfair was one of several former players charged in a scheme to defraud the NBA's health and welfare benefit plan. He insists he has done too much good to be sent to jail and hopes the president will review his story.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a public safety emergency in Washington D.C., ordering the deployment of 800 National Guard troops and placing the city's police force under federal control. Trump cited what he called "complete and total lawlessness," including violent gangs and homelessness, as justification for the move. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other Democrats have strongly condemned the action as an unjustified power grab, pointing to official data showing that violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low.

The repeal, signed into law by the governor, was heavily lobbied for by business groups and has been described as a "literal gut punch" by workers who fought for the measure. Labor advocates argue that elected officials have sided with corporate interests over the health and financial stability of working families.

The action is viewed as a pretext to implement a harsher policing strategy, which critics fear will lead to increased police violence and harassment.

          <p>During a trial for California's lawsuit against the Trump administration, a high-ranking general involved in the National Guard deployment to Los Angeles testified that he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The lawsuit challenges the legality of the deployment under the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The general's testimony is significant as the administration has partly justified the action by invoking a law that allows for such deployments during a rebellion. The trial is examining whether the use of military forces to support federal agents during immigration protests was an illegal power grab.</p>

          <h2>Fed Officials View Weak Jobs Data as Reason for Rate Cuts, Contrasting Trump's "Rigged" Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While President Trump dismissed a recent weak jobs report as "rigged" and fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve officials are interpreting the same data as evidence of a slowing economy. Top Fed officials, including Governor Michelle Bowman, have indicated the fragile labor market data could justify the interest rate cuts that Trump has been demanding. This divergence highlights a significant split in how the administration and the central bank are viewing the health of the U.S. economy. Investors are now anticipating a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska's governor has issued a state disaster declaration for the Juneau area due to the imminent threat of a catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Monitoring indicates that Suicide Basin, a part of the Mendenhall Glacier, has filled with water to levels that have previously caused record flooding, and a release is expected at any time. This would be the third consecutive year of serious glacier-related flooding for the state capital, which has previously caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. Authorities have installed flood barriers along the Mendenhall River in an attempt to mitigate the potential impact.</p>

          <p>Police in Spain have dismantled an organization that was allegedly running a "spiritual retreat" offering clients dangerous substances, including hallucinogenic drugs and toxic frog venom. The group operated from a villa, charging significant fees for multi-day stays that involved the consumption of ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, and Kambo, a frog secretion. The investigation began after a complaint from a victim, revealing a company that advertised internationally and generated large amounts of undeclared income. Three suspected leaders were arrested, and police warned that the substances offered can have unpredictable and dangerous effects on users.</p>

          <p>China's national trademark authority has rejected an application from OpenAI to trademark the term "GPT-5," dealing a blow to the U.S. AI firm's branding efforts in the country. The application, filed through a subsidiary, was denied and is currently pending appeal, according to official records. This follows a similar setback in the United States, where the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office also denied applications for "ChatGPT" and "GPT" on the grounds that the terms merely describe a function of the company's services. The rejections highlight the challenges OpenAI faces in protecting its key product branding in major global markets.</p>

          <p>Military veterans across the U.S. are experiencing extensive delays and errors in receiving their GI Bill education benefits, causing significant financial hardship and forcing some to drop out of college. Advocacy groups and college officials attribute the problems to staffing cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) under the Trump administration, which have tripled processing times. The disruptions are creating anxiety and frustration for student veterans who rely on the funding for tuition, housing, and textbooks. The issue threatens access to higher education for a population that already faces challenges navigating the complex benefits system.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is facing a severe shortage of Black recruits, with recent academy classes graduating without a single Black officer. This long-standing challenge is being compounded by a national political campaign against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, led by President Trump. The LAPD recently shut down its own DEI program, and some Black officers express frustration over a lack of support and opportunities, which they believe deters new applicants. With many senior Black officers nearing retirement, there are growing concerns about the department's ability to reflect the diversity of the city it serves.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist has sharply criticized the decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to cancel $500 million in federal grants for mRNA vaccine research. The columnist argues the move is based on a flawed and biased collection of data that misrepresents the technology's safety and efficacy, ignoring major studies that show the vaccines saved millions of lives. The cancellation is described as a devastating blow to science and public health that could hamstring American research for decades. This action is seen as ceding a critical life-saving technology to Europe and China.</p>

          <p>After being denied access for two months, several Democratic members of Congress inspected a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center in Los Angeles, only to find it nearly empty. The representatives accused the government of deliberately sanitizing the facility, known as B-18, to obstruct congressional oversight. The center, which can hold over 300 people, had only two detainees present during the visit, despite numerous complaints of overcrowding and poor conditions in recent months. The lawmakers described the visit as leaving them with more questions than answers and vowed to continue seeking accountability.</p>

          <p>A summer leadership program in California's Inland Empire is teaching children from immigrant families about civic engagement, a mission that has gained urgency amid recent immigration enforcement raids. The program, run by the legal center TODEC, helps kids understand how to identify community problems and advocate for change, with many participants having been directly affected by family separations and detentions. During a recent mock city council meeting, the children voted to fund mental health workshops to address the fear in their community. The initiative aims to give a voice and a sense of agency to a generation confronting difficult realities.</p>
