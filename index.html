          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, Flight AI171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff near Ahmedabad airport in Gujarat, India. The flight, carrying 242 passengers and crew, went down in the Meghaninagar area outside the airport perimeter. Indian authorities have mobilized rescue teams and emergency services to respond to the crash, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the accident. The captain had substantial experience with 8,200 hours of flying time, while the copilot had 1,100 hours of experience, according to the Directorate General. </p>

          <p>Council tax in the UK is projected to rise by 5% each year to fund local services, according to documents in the Spending Review. The increase will also support increased police funding, as local authorities can raise the tax by up to 5% annually, with some councils potentially increasing bills by more through local referendums or central government approval. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that councils are not obligated to raise council tax by the maximum amount, but the review assumes they will. The Spending Review also indicates a 2.3% annual rise in police spending power, which assumes an increase in the police precept included in council tax. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, reversing gains from the previous four months. The decline is attributed to the implementation of global trade tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump and domestic tax increases, which created business uncertainty. The data indicated a notable drop in industrial production and services output, particularly affecting UK exports to the United States following the introduction of tariffs. The UK was subjected to a 10% tariff from the U.S., despite a balanced trading relationship.</p>

The song was produced by hip-hop producer Matt Dike, and though Wilson initially believed it would be a hit, the album was ultimately rejected by Sire.

          <h2>Local Leaders Say Current Unrest in L.A. Differs Significantly from 1992 Riots</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Local leaders involved in addressing the 1992 Los Angeles riots assert that the current unrest, stemming from President Trump's deployment of soldiers, bears little resemblance to the events following the Rodney King verdict. Unlike the widespread violence and deep-seated distrust of 1992, the recent protests are more limited in scope and have not resulted in the same level of destruction. Key differences include bipartisan coordination among law enforcement agencies in 1992, which is absent in the current situation, and the perception of a localized event amplified by social media. While acknowledging the inappropriate actions of some protesters, leaders emphasize that the impacted area is a small portion of the city.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to hold a costly military parade in Washington, D.C., has drawn criticism as it comes amidst cuts to vital social programs. The parade, estimated to cost as much as $45 million, stands in stark contrast to the reduced funding for organizations like White Pony Express, which provides food to needy people in the Bay Area. The nonprofit could lose up to a third of its $3 million annual budget due to federal cuts, jeopardizing services for 130,000 people each year. Critics argue that the parade represents a misallocation of resources, prioritizing vanity over the needs of vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Following recent ICE raids in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, an eerie silence has fallen over Central Coast farm fields, with many workers absent and farm gates locked. Immigration agents targeted fields and packinghouses, with reports indicating at least 35 people were detained. Farm owners reportedly denied agents access without judicial warrants, but the raids have caused widespread concern among farmworkers, many of whom are undocumented and have lived in California for years. While California's agricultural sector has largely been spared from large-scale raids, this week's actions signal a potential shift in enforcement strategy, prompting calls for a legal workforce and disrupting food production.</p>

          <p>Claims that the proposed "Big Beautiful Bill" will result in substantial economic growth are likely overstated, despite assertions by President Trump and allies. While extending the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may provide some economic stability, it is primarily a defensive move with modest growth potential. The bill includes tax breaks and spending hikes that are not pro-growth, contributing to a $2.4 trillion increase in federal debt. The economic benefits of the tax cuts are likely offset by the negative impact of ongoing trade wars, highlighting the need for genuine tax reform and fiscal responsibility.

          <p>A new generation of restaurateurs in Los Angeles is embracing a more modest business model, focusing on a single location or a few establishments rather than pursuing large-scale expansion. These independent owner-operators prioritize direct engagement with customers and employees, seeking gratification through local connections and comfort. To improve their chances of success, they avoid high-rent spaces, operate multiple concepts from shared locations, and actively work the room. While the restaurant industry faces challenges such as changing consumer preferences and economic pressures, these owners are adapting by downsizing, partnering up, and selling their wares wholesale.</p>

          <p>Ongoing protests in Los Angeles, spurred by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, have brought attention to the psychological trauma experienced by protesters, residents, and law enforcement. Studies show that participation in protests can lead to feelings of indignity, frustration, and despair, with violence exacerbating these effects. The perception that Los Angeles is consumed by riots is being used to justify strong-arm responses, despite the reality of localized unrest. Research indicates that major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder increase in communities affected by protests, emphasizing the need to address the psychological impact of social unrest.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has issued an opinion stating that President Trump has the authority to undo national monument designations made by previous presidents, potentially impacting California's Chuckwalla and SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands monuments.

The finding follows efforts to explore altering monuments to expand U.S. energy production, raising concerns among conservationists. Senator Alex Padilla questioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum about the opinion, describing it as "extremely dangerous," while other lawmakers emphasized that Congress did not intend for the Antiquities Act to allow presidents to eliminate designated lands.</p>
