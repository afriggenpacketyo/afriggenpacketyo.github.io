A tropical storm watch is in effect for Baja California Sur, where the storm is bringing high surf and gusty winds. Forecasters predict continued weakening over the next 48 hours as it moves parallel to the coast.

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has responded to an op-ed by six former Surgeons General who accused Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of posing an "unprecedented" threat to national health. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon stated that these critics "presided over the decline in America's public health" and are now criticizing the first Secretary to confront it. The op-ed cited Kennedy's promotion of false vaccine claims and unproven treatments, while HHS reaffirmed its commitment to restoring trust and reforming healthcare systems.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service announced it will furlough approximately 34,000 employees, nearly half its workforce, starting October 8, due to the ongoing government shutdown. This decision will severely hinder taxpayers' ability to receive assistance, leading to increased wait times and backlogs. The National Treasury Employees Union condemned the move, highlighting the impact on vital services and the upcoming tax extension deadline. Questions also arise regarding potential back pay for furloughed workers, despite a 2019 law.</p>

          <p>Google is tightening its "Work from Anywhere" (WFA) policy, established during the Covid pandemic, by counting even a single day of remote work as a full week from the annual four-week allowance. This change, which does not alter the hybrid schedule of two days remote work, aims to limit employees working outside their main office. The tech giant, alongside others like Microsoft and Amazon, is increasingly pushing for more in-office presence. Violations of the updated policy could lead to disciplinary action or termination.</p>

          <p>Jihad Al-Shamie, the Manchester synagogue attacker, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during a 999 call after his car and knife assault killed two Jewish men. Police confirmed the attacker, who was shot dead, wore a hoax explosive device. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the police's use of lethal force, as one victim and another man were struck by police bullets. Prior allegations of sexual assault against Al-Shamie are also under review, adding another layer to the complex investigation.</p>

          <p>California is challenging President Trump's control over its National Guard, arguing in federal court that the White House used claims of unrest in Los Angeles as a pretext for expanded deployments, including sending troops to Illinois. The state contends that federalization is being used for missions beyond court-approved limits, such as drug raids and deployments to other states. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized Trump's actions as an "illegal charade" that harms democratic traditions. This escalating legal battle highlights a significant power struggle between federal and state authorities over military forces.</p>

Additionally, HELOCs offer potential tax benefits if used for qualifying home repair projects, further enhancing their affordability compared to credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former Royal Marine, Christopher Lambie, is suing the Ministry of Defence (MoD) over noise-induced hearing loss, alleging that he and other unit members cheated hearing tests to ensure deployment.

The MoD accepts a duty of care and primary causation in his case but disputes the extent of damages. This case is one of four test cases that will influence compensation for about 10,000 former personnel suing the MoD.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced plans to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland, a key policy unveiled in her first conference speech. This proposal aims to boost homeownership and improve social mobility by removing a tax that discourages house moves. The Conservatives estimate the measure would cost the Treasury £9 billion annually after 2029, funded by £47 billion in planned savings from welfare, foreign aid, and civil service cuts. Badenoch presented a "golden rule" to dedicate half of all savings to deficit reduction.</p>
