          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, stated that a quick resumption of diplomatic talks with the U.S. is unlikely, citing the need for assurances against further military attacks. This follows U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog described as causing "severe" but not "total" damage. Despite the recent 12-day conflict with Israel and defiant rhetoric from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Araghchi affirmed that "the doors of diplomacy will never slam shut," indicating a potential but delayed path to negotiations.</p>

          <p>A new mobile malware strain named SparkKitty is targeting both Android and iPhone devices, posing a significant threat to user privacy and financial security. Identified by Kaspersky researchers, the malware scans a device's photo library for images containing sensitive information, such as cryptocurrency recovery phrases and personal IDs, and uploads them indiscriminately to attacker-controlled servers. Distributed through apps on official and unofficial stores, SparkKitty represents an evolution of previous malware by bulk-uploading all images, not just targeted data. Users are advised to be cautious with app permissions and download only from trusted developers.</p>

          <p>A new report from Govini, a defense acquisition information firm, warns that the U.S. is "not prepared" for a potential conflict with China due to its significant reliance on Chinese suppliers for its defense industrial base. The analysis found that Chinese firms constituted 9.3% of primary contractors for major U.S. defense programs across nine critical sectors in 2024. The missile defense sector showed the highest dependency, with 11.1% of its Tier 1 suppliers based in China. The report characterizes U.S. supply chains as "incredibly brittle," highlighting a major vulnerability in national security.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, according to prosecutors. Under the agreement, he will plead guilty to four counts of murder and receive four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The decision has elicited mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing relief at avoiding a lengthy trial while others are furious at the state for offering the deal. The case, which drew national attention, was built on DNA evidence from a knife sheath found at the scene linking Kohberger to the crime.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that President Trump's tariff plan was the primary reason the central bank has not lowered interest rates. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell stated that had the tariffs not been announced, the Fed would likely have already implemented a more accommodative monetary policy. He explained that the imposition of tariffs caused inflation forecasts to rise significantly, compelling the Fed to maintain its "on hold" stance regarding rate adjustments. This directly links the administration's trade policy to the central bank's recent monetary decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has charged several individuals in a widespread scheme where North Korea allegedly placed thousands of its IT workers in remote jobs at American companies to fund its weapons program. These workers used stolen or fake identities to pose as U.S.-based employees, deceiving corporations, including some Fortune 500 companies, into hiring them. The wages earned, totaling over $5 million in one case, were funneled back to North Korea. The operation not only generated illicit revenue but also gave the workers access to sensitive corporate data, representing a significant national security and economic threat.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's massive tax and spending bill, facing dissent from at least four party members. The legislative process has stalled in a marathon session of amendment debates, known as a "vote-a-rama," highlighting deep divisions within the party over spending cuts to programs like Medicaid. President Trump has conceded that his original July 4 deadline is unlikely to be met. The bill, which extends first-term tax cuts, must pass the Senate and then return to the narrowly controlled House, where it faces another difficult battle for approval.</p>

          <p>A Yale Budget Lab analysis concludes that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would disproportionately harm low-income Americans while benefiting the wealthy. The study found that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9%, or about $700, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and SNAP benefits. Conversely, the top 20% of earners would experience a 2.2% income increase, averaging $5,700 per year, from the extension of tax cuts. These findings align with other nonpartisan analyses suggesting the bill's net effect would be regressive. (not investment advice)</p>

In the second quarter, public firms added approximately 131,000 bitcoins, an 18% increase, compared to the 111,000 bitcoins added by ETFs. Analysts suggest companies are emulating Strategy's (formerly MicroStrategy) playbook of accumulating bitcoin to enhance shareholder value, a trend bolstered by a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration.

The new investigation focuses on the leadership's decision-making and response to the increased infant fatalities during that period.

          <p>A ProPublica report alleges that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not publicly disclose an $80,000 payment she received in 2023 while serving as South Dakota's governor. The payment came from a "dark money" nonprofit group, American Resolve Policy Fund, for which she helped fundraise. The same group later funded social media ads attacking news outlets that had reported critically on Noem's use of taxpayer funds. While not necessarily illegal, the lack of disclosure about a private business relationship with a political group has raised ethical questions. Noem's lawyer stated that she "fully complied with the letter and the spirit of the law."</p>

          <p>As the jury deliberates in Sean Combs' federal trial, the case hinges on whether his sexual encounters with accusers were consensual or coercive. The prosecution has portrayed Combs as a violent and controlling figure who used his resources to facilitate sex trafficking, while the defense argues the encounters were unconventional but not illegal. The complex charges include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution, built on testimony from 34 witnesses over six weeks. The defense rested without calling witnesses, focusing instead on challenging the prosecution's ability to prove a lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

He is accused of one count of sexual assault and 36 counts of indecent assault against 13 women. The court heard that Brain surrounded himself with a team of young women who were allegedly coerced into performing sexual favors, with Brain framing the abuse as a form of "healing."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can exclude Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from their Medicaid programs, a decision that could severely impact the organization's survival. The ruling effectively allows states to deny reimbursement for a wide range of non-abortion services, such as cancer screenings and contraception, based on a provider's political stance on abortion. This empowers states to choke off a major funding stream for clinics that serve a disproportionately low-income population. The decision is seen as a significant blow to reproductive healthcare access and a de facto ban on care from pro-choice providers for many women.</p>

This continued preference for Airbus, along with China's promotion of its homegrown C919 plane, reflects a strategic shift driven by geopolitical and safety concerns.

These cuts are intended to pay for extending tax breaks that disproportionately benefit top earners.
