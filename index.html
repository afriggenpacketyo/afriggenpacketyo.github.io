            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 21:06:47 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A Los Angeles judge has ruled that the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing can proceed, despite objections from the district attorney. Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking a reduced sentence that could make them eligible for parole under a California law allowing resentencing for inmates under 26 at the time of their crimes. The district attorney argued the brothers haven't fully taken responsibility, but the judge emphasized maintaining consistency even with shifts in leadership, noting no new information had emerged. The case gained renewed attention due to new evidence and a Netflix drama, sparking celebrity calls for their release.</p>

            <p>Southern California Edison is investigating the possibility that an idle, unconnected transmission line may have caused the Eaton fire due to a rare phenomenon called induction. CEO Pedro Pizarro stated that induction, where the magnetic field of an active line induces current in an unconnected line, is a leading hypothesis. Edison is taking precautionary steps, including additional field inspections and revising internal manuals to ensure proper grounding of idle equipment, aiming to prevent future incidents. The utility reported a momentary surge of electrical current on four lines around the time the fire ignited, prompting further investigation and safety measures.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe to prevent its closure. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, is losing £700,000 daily despite significant investment, and is facing raw material shortages. Emergency legislation is being considered to allow the government to order raw materials and direct the company's workforce, ensuring continued operation and preventing job losses. The move aims to protect the UK's steel industry, which is facing challenging market conditions and high production costs.</p>

If China weathers the tariff storm, it may boost Beijing's confidence in facing future sanctions related to Taiwan. However, any decision regarding Taiwan remains a complex political and military calculation for Beijing. The United States has imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports, signaling a firm stance against unilateral changes to Taiwan's status.</p>
