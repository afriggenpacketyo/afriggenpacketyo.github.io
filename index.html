          <p>A growing number of companies are utilizing AI-powered "surveillance pricing" to offer the same product at different prices to different people based on their data. This practice, an advanced form of dynamic pricing, analyzes signals like location, search history, and loyalty status to determine what a consumer might be willing to pay. While companies like Delta and Amazon deny using personal data for individualized pricing, investigations have revealed such practices at Kroger and Target, sparking consumer outrage and legislative scrutiny over privacy and fairness.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old father, Daniel Gunter, has been found guilty of murdering his premature two-week-old baby at a hospital in Yeovil, UK. The infant, Brendon Staddon, suffered extensive injuries, including a fractured skull and broken neck, consistent with being swung against a hard surface. The court heard that hospital staff had previously raised concerns about Gunter's rough handling of the baby. The baby's mother was acquitted of related charges, and Gunter is scheduled for sentencing in October.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed the launch of a new political party aimed at providing an alternative to both Labour and Reform. Corbyn, along with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, is co-founding the yet-unnamed party to campaign for a "mass redistribution of wealth" and address issues like child poverty and corporate profits. The initiative is being positioned as a grassroots, community-led movement, with an inaugural conference planned for the autumn to establish its policies.</p>

          <p>AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, warn that a simple "kill switch" will not be effective in controlling artificial intelligence once it surpasses human intellect. The distributed and integrated nature of AI systems means that shutting them down could require disabling critical global infrastructure, leading to a humanitarian crisis. Instead of a physical off-switch, experts suggest the focus should be on instilling benevolent values in AI and developing robust governance. They caution that AI's persuasive power could be its most potent tool, potentially manipulating humans to ensure its own survival.</p>

          <p>Rapper GloRilla, whose real name is Gloria Woods, is facing drug charges after police discovered a significant amount of marijuana in her home while investigating a burglary. Deputies responded to a break-in at her Forsyth County residence, where suspects were reportedly stealing items when someone inside fired at them. Although Woods was not present during the burglary, the subsequent investigation led to the drug discovery. She later turned herself in and was released on bond, marking another legal issue for the rapper in Georgia.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has convicted two former militia leaders from the Central African Republic, Alfred Yekatom and Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona, of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The men were leaders of the "anti-Balaka" militias and were found guilty of directing a violent campaign against Muslim civilians in 2013-2014 that included murder, torture, and persecution. Yekatom, known as "Rambo," was sentenced to 15 years, while Ngaissona received a 12-year term, marking a significant step for international justice in the conflict-ridden nation.</p>

          <p>An Angara Airlines passenger plane has crashed in Russia's far east, with authorities reporting no survivors among the 48 passengers and crew on board. The Antonov An-24 aircraft, a nearly 50-year-old Soviet-designed plane, went down in a remote, hilly area near its destination of Tynda. The plane reportedly disappeared from radar during its second landing approach, and while the crew had not reported any issues, rough weather is being considered as a potential factor. This incident raises further concerns about Russia's aging aviation fleet amid Western sanctions.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to hold interest rates at 2%, pausing its year-long cycle of rate cuts.

          <p>Human rights groups and politicians are urging the German government to clarify its refugee policy for Palestinians, particularly those fleeing Gaza. Germany's migration office had previously "deprioritized" asylum applications from Palestinians, citing an "uncertain situation," a move that was successfully challenged in court. Now, advocates argue that Palestinians should be granted full refugee status under the Geneva Convention, rather than just subsidiary protection, especially since the UN agency UNRWA is unable to operate in Gaza. This would provide them with a clearer path to permanent residency and family reunification.</p>

The airline now projects a 2025 adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, down significantly from its initial estimates.

Eliminating it would dismantle federal climate regulations and hamstring future efforts to address the climate crisis.
