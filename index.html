          <p>China's government has again vowed to tackle the oversupply and "disorderly low-price competition" within its massive solar photovoltaic industry. Industry and Information Technology Minister Li Lecheng met with manufacturers, urging them to improve quality and phase out outdated production capacity to ensure sustainable development. This follows a directive from President Xi Jinping to address excess industrial capacity, though it remains to be seen if these new efforts will be more effective than previous attempts.</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi warns that Iran's government is intensifying its repression of citizens, particularly activists, following its recent war with Israel. Speaking from Tehran, she states the regime is using the conflict to deflect from internal issues, leading to a surge in arrests and executions to instill fear. Mohammadi, who is defying an order to return to Evin Prison, calls for international attention on the deteriorating human rights situation and the harsh conditions faced by political prisoners.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group seized power in 2021. The announcement followed a meeting in Kabul between the Afghan Foreign Minister and Russia's ambassador. Moscow stated it would assist the Taliban in combating terrorism and drug trafficking while boosting economic cooperation, a move critics argue prioritizes strategic interests over human rights and international law.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's current policies. The employees' letter argued the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment under the Trump administration. The agency responded by accusing the signers of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions, though the leave is not a disciplinary measure.</p>

          <p>A search is underway for Marites Buenafe, a 62-year-old cruise ship passenger who went missing during a solo hike in Juneau, Alaska. Buenafe, a physician from Kentucky, texted her family about her hiking plans but failed to return to her Norwegian Bliss cruise ship before its departure. Security cameras last saw her at the top of the Mount Roberts Tramway, and a multi-agency search involving helicopters, drones, and K-9 units is now active in the mountainous terrain.</p>

The legislation extends tax cuts but also fundamentally alters Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with new work requirements and funding cuts. While proponents argue it curbs waste, critics warn the changes will cause millions to lose benefits and could negatively impact local economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR interview with journalist McKay Coppins explores the ideological influence of Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought on President Trump's major tax and spending bill. While Vought didn't write the legislation, its goals of shrinking the federal government and cutting programs like Medicaid align with his "post-constitutional" vision for a politicized federal bureaucracy. The article suggests Vought's project is less about fiscal conservatism and more about a radical restructuring of government power toward the executive branch.</p>
