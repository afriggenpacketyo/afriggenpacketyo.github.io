          <p>California's ambitious high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled costs, raising questions about the state's ability to complete large-scale infrastructure projects. Eminent-domain lawyer Mark Wasser, representing landowners affected by the project, disputes claims that property acquisition is the primary cause of the delays. The California High-Speed Rail Authority aims to have trains running between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033, but the original vision of connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco remains distant. The article examines the complexities of acquiring land in the Central Valley, where the rail line cuts diagonally through valuable farmland, disrupting farming operations and leaving unusable remnants.

          <p>President Trump's expansion of executive power is not merely an extension of the unitary executive theory, but is rooted in a longer tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical and dictatorial rule. Legal theorist Carl Schmitt and philosopher Leo Strauss influenced thinkers affiliated with the Claremont Institute, who seek to roll back the administrative state and consolidate power in the presidency. Adrian Vermeule combines Schmittian influence with medieval political theology to argue for maximal presidential power. This view combines maximal leeway to act with maximal power to execute decisions, potentially transforming the presidency into a dictatorial office. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has scrapped over $800 million in NIH research grants focused on LGBTQ health, affecting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. The cuts, justified by officials as rejections of "unscientific" gender identity research and "amorphous equity objectives," impact numerous institutions and dismantle a decade of growing federal support for LGBTQ health. Scientists argue these actions create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address health disparities. The NIH defended the move as restoring the agency to "gold-standard, evidence-based science." Optimism score: 25</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's "Forever 31" skit captured the anxieties of millennial women, showcasing stylish yet comfortable clothing for those balancing careers and personal lives. The parody ad for a fictional store satirized the transition from carefree 20s to the responsibilities of the 30s, including career concerns and family pressures. Unlike past skits mocking fashion choices, "Forever 31" highlighted the relatability of prioritizing comfort and practicality, resonating with viewers who recognized the aesthetic and the underlying anxieties. The choice of Quinta Brunson, known for her role as Janine Teagues on Abbott Elementary, further amplified the skit's message. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>With America facing a severe housing shortage, innovative solutions are emerging to address affordability by repurposing existing single-family homes. Developer Monte Anderson is converting homes into "roommate houses" with multiple studio apartments, exploiting loopholes in zoning codes. This approach, along with the rise of backyard cottages and lot subdivisions, aims to add housing in established neighborhoods without major disruption. In California, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) have become a significant source of new housing, while companies like BuildCasa are connecting homeowners with developers to maximize property potential.

          <p>Marvel and Disney's newest release, Thunderbolts*, has proven a hit at the box office, after taking an estimated $162m (£122m) internationally. The film, which both production houses hope will kickstart a new franchise, is based around lesser-known superheroes who have to take on human and superhuman threats whilst fighting their own personal battles. It means the film receives the third highest audience score for a Marvel title, tying with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shangi-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Spider-Man: No Way Home.

          <p>The White House shared a meme on Star Wars Day featuring President Trump as a muscular Jedi figure, but the image notably depicted him wielding a red lightsaber, a symbol of the Sith Lords. The post's caption condemned "Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members," but the use of the Sith symbol created confusion. This incident follows criticism of the White House for sharing an AI-generated image of Trump as the Pope shortly after Pope Francis's death. Optimism score: 50</p>
