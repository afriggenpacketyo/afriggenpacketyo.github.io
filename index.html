          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank would have likely lowered interest rates by now if not for the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariff policies. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell explained that the tariffs forced the Fed to adopt a "hold" position as inflation forecasts rose materially. The Fed has maintained its key borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5% since December, despite pressure from the White House to ease monetary policy. Powell reiterated that future decisions will be data-dependent and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are advancing an updated version of a major legislative package central to President Trump's agenda. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent and includes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Key provisions remain in flux as the bill undergoes the amendment process, with Senate leaders negotiating changes to secure enough votes for passage before the July 4th recess. The legislation also raises the debt ceiling, increases the SALT deduction cap, and modifies the child tax credit, among other significant fiscal changes.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value dropped after President Trump suggested on social media that a government efficiency agency should investigate federal subsidies received by Elon Musk's companies. The comments escalate a public feud between the two, reportedly stemming from Musk's criticism of the administration's tax and spending bill, which proposes cutting support for electric vehicles. In response, Musk reiterated his call to eliminate all government subsidies, including his own. This renewed tension highlights the volatile relationship between the administration and the prominent tech billionaire. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a major spike in U.S. consumer prices, with key inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. However, experts caution that this stability may be temporary, as these buffering strategies are not sustainable long-term. They anticipate that the impact of the tariffs will likely become more apparent in consumer prices later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

Brain faces 37 charges, including one count of sexual assault and 36 counts of indecent assault involving 13 women.

This question often catches managers off guard, leading to more honest and less rehearsed answers that reveal the real work culture, beyond corporate platitudes. Examples of revealing responses include 'a person who doesn't want to text on weekends' or 'someone who's too social.' Welch advises asking this question at the end of the interview process to gauge alignment between personal values and the company's actual operational environment.</p>

The analysis, which reviewed Department of Defense spending data, found that U.S. supply chains are 'incredibly brittle.'

          <p>A new analysis by the Yale Budget Lab indicates that the Republican legislative package currently in the Senate would financially benefit the wealthiest Americans while harming the lowest earners. The report projects that the bill would reduce annual income for the bottom 20% of households by about $700, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Conversely, the top 20% of earners would see their income increase by an average of $5,700 per year, largely from the extension of tax cuts. These findings align with other analyses suggesting the bill's net effect would be regressive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to clarify how it plans to implement an executive order denying citizenship to U.S.-born children of certain immigrants. The order came after the Supreme Court partially stayed nationwide injunctions against the policy, creating confusion about its enforcement. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman specifically asked if the government intends to deport babies subject to the order before a final ruling is made. A Justice Department attorney stated that agencies are still developing implementation guidelines and are not currently seeking to deport infants.</p>

Combs faces charges of sex trafficking, transportation for prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy, with the defense arguing that the sexual activities were consensual, albeit unconventional. The prosecution presented 34 witnesses to portray Combs as a violent and controlling figure who used his business empire to facilitate illegal acts. Legal experts note that the racketeering charge is broad, while the sex trafficking charge may be the most difficult to prove given the defense's focus on consent.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is selling a portion of its holdings in the semiconductor company Broadcom, booking a significant profit. The move comes after the stock surged to new all-time highs, gaining nearly 90% since its low point in April and keeping it as one of the largest positions in the fund's portfolio. The club is trimming the position to avoid 'getting too greedy' and to raise cash while the market is in an overbought condition, according to its internal indicators. The sale will realize a 220% gain on shares that were originally purchased in August 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Official Figures Show Notable Increase in Births to Fathers Over 60 in England and Wales</h2>

          <p>The number of babies born to fathers aged 60 and over in England and Wales rose by 14.2% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While the total number of births in England saw a slight increase for the first time since 2021, the trend of having children later in life continues, with births to parents under 30 decreasing. Experts find the rise in older fathers notable, given that male fertility typically declines with age. The data also reflects societal trends, including the rising cost of living, which is often cited as a reason for delaying parenthood.</p>

          <p>The M2 'Ma Deuce' Browning, a century-old American heavy machine gun, is being integrated into Ukraine's advanced, AI-enabled ground combat robots. Ukrainian defense firms are mounting the .50 caliber weapon on autonomous vehicles designed to attack Russian positions. Manufacturers cite the M2's reliability and the wide availability of the gun and its ammunition in Western arsenals as key reasons for its selection, especially as stocks of Soviet-era weapons dwindle. This integration showcases the war's blend of historic, reliable weaponry with cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and autonomous warfare systems.</p>

          <p>Certain commonly prescribed medications can interfere with the body's natural ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of heat-related illness during hot weather. This article identifies five types of drugs, including some antidepressants, antipsychotics, heart medications like beta-blockers and diuretics, ADHD stimulants, and insulin. These medications can disrupt processes like sweating, blood flow, and fluid balance, making it harder for the body to cool down. Experts advise patients taking these drugs to stay hydrated, avoid peak heat, and watch for warning signs of illness, without stopping their prescribed medication.</p>
