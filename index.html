          <p>Newark, N.J., Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility during a protest with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation. Baraka, along with other officials, was protesting the opening of a private immigration detention center in Newark, arguing it was dangerous and illegal due to lacking proper permits and inspections. Federal officials stated Baraka committed trespass and ignored warnings from Homeland Security Investigations. The incident led to outrage from Governor Murphy and accusations of intimidation from congressmembers Menendez and Watson Coleman, who were present at the protest.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intent of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in orbit for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to survive Venus’s atmosphere, has a chance of partially surviving its descent to Earth, but the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low. If any pieces of the spacecraft are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

With prisons facing overcrowding and potential cell shortages, the union emphasizes the need for adequate resources to support offenders in the community and prevent reoffending.

          <p>A recent terrorist attack on tourists in Kashmir has triggered a military conflict between India and Pakistan, highlighting a dangerous shift in their rivalry. India, under Prime Minister Modi, views Pakistan as a threat to its rise, while Pakistan, facing economic and political crises, is unwilling to back down on issues like Kashmir. The conflict has eliminated diplomatic space and threatens guardrails that previously prevented escalation, including a treaty on river sharing. With the U.S. stepping back as a crisis manager, the situation is primed to become nastier, with the potential for nuclear conflict.</p>

          <p>China's nuclear power construction is rapidly expanding, with over 100 reactors either operational or under construction, surpassing all other countries. A new PLA study warns that these coastal reactors could become prime targets in wartime, posing catastrophic risks if China fails to defend them. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which challenged the notion of civilian nuclear plants being immune to military strikes, has prompted Chinese military researchers to re-evaluate security risks and propose enhanced defenses and emergency response strategies.

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) fired by President Trump, said his dismissal is illegal and he intends to challenge it in court. Trumka alleges his firing occurred after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. Trumka argues that DOGE would gut the agency and compromise product safety. Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the firings, calling them illegal and an attack on the independence of the CPSC.</p>

          <p>Over 100 current and former Amtrak employees conspired with New York medical professionals to defraud the company's health care plan out of over $12 million. The scheme involved employees accepting cash in exchange for their insurance information, which was then used to file fraudulent claims for services never provided. Twelve Amtrak employees and three healthcare providers were criminally charged, and several employees have retired or resigned. Amtrak said it is considering disciplinary action for the remaining active employees involved and is calling on medical benefit providers to identify and stop medical insurance fraud.</p>
