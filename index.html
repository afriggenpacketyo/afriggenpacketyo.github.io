          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a proposal the SEC is now reviewing. Proponents, including Trump, argue this would save money and allow companies to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. Critics, however, believe the current system offers essential transparency and timely information for investors, and that less frequent reporting could create more difficulties than benefits. The move would align U.S. practices more with those in the U.K. and E.U., though some experts note the U.S. market's unique scale makes comparisons difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, has passed a key procedural vote in the Senate, setting up a final confirmation. His nomination has sparked controversy, as Miran plans to remain chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisors, raising concerns among Democrats about the Fed's political independence. Although his potential four-and-a-half-month term is short, critics worry his presence could undermine the central bank's autonomy, especially as it considers interest rate cuts. Miran has stated he would resign from the White House if confirmed for a longer term. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities state that Luchin passed notes demanding money to tellers at three different locations before being identified and apprehended. This is not his first encounter with such charges; in 2018, he admitted to robbing a bank, citing severe financial struggles after his restaurant closed. Luchin is currently being held on robbery charges with bail set at $200,000.</p>

          <p>Researchers from UCLA and Heal the Bay have released a non-toxic, fluorescent pink dye into the Santa Monica Bay to study ocean circulation patterns. The study aims to understand why the area near the pier consistently ranks among California's dirtiest beaches, with a focus on how a 1930s-era breakwater might be trapping pollutants. By tracking the dye's movement, scientists hope to gather data that could lead to solutions for the bay's poor water quality. Officials have assured the public that the temporary dye poses no risk to people or marine life.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's influence is expanding significantly as the global geopolitical order undergoes a major shift for the first time since the Cold War. The author points to recent events, such as Kenya's move to de-dollarize debt and Europe's reliance on Chinese rare earths, as evidence of Beijing's growing momentum.

          <p>President Trump has commented on the murder of a Dallas motel manager, Chandra Nagamallaiah, linking the crime to immigration policy. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, is a Cuban national with an extensive arrest history who is in the U.S. illegally. Trump blamed the previous administration for the suspect's release, though ICE stated Cuba would not accept his deportation and he was released under supervision in the final days of the Biden administration. A former Biden official countered that the Trump administration was responsible for managing that supervision order, highlighting the political debate over immigration enforcement and public safety.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the White House is requesting an additional $58 million from Congress for security. The funds are intended for the executive and judicial branches and would be added to a temporary spending bill to avert a government shutdown. This request comes amid heightened security concerns following Kirk's death and previous assassination attempts on President Trump. The U.S. Secret Service is reportedly implementing significant changes to its protective operations in response to the evolving and elevated threat landscape.</p>

The report identifies the state's steep housing costs as a primary driver of this crisis, particularly for renters. This marks a significant increase from a historic low in 2021, when expanded public benefits during the pandemic temporarily reduced poverty. The rollback of these policies has led to a sharp rise in poverty, which disproportionately affects children, older adults, and Black and Latino populations.</p>

          <p>This article details the history behind the "Hillsborough Law," a piece of legislation born from the 36-year struggle for justice by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 stadium disaster. The law was conceived after the 2016 inquests revealed systemic failures and a culture of cover-ups by public authorities. Its two core principles are a legal "duty of candour" to ensure transparency from officials and parity of legal funding for victims and state bodies during inquiries. Despite delays, the bill is now set to be introduced, representing a significant legacy for the Hillsborough campaigners and a potential safeguard for victims of future state-related tragedies.</p>

          <p>An endangered Southern Resident orca, identified as J36, has been seen carrying her dead newborn calf in the waters of Washington's Salish Sea. Researchers confirmed the female calf was deceased, marking another tragic loss for the struggling orca population, which now numbers only 73. This behavior, seemingly an expression of grief or an attempt at revival, has been observed before, most famously in 2018 when another orca carried her dead calf for 17 days. The high rate of calf mortality in this population is linked to a lack of their primary food source, Chinook salmon, as well as pollution and vessel noise.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a framework deal with China that could prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, with a final agreement pending a discussion between the two nations' leaders. The deal aims to transfer the popular video app to American ownership to address national security concerns about its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. While specific terms remain undisclosed, Chinese officials confirmed a "basic consensus" has been reached, including on the use of TikTok's algorithm and the handling of U.S. user data. This development comes after President Trump repeatedly extended deadlines for the ban, citing the app's popularity with young voters.</p>

The tool uses a large language model to distill content from product catalogs, reviews, and the web into concise clips accessible in the mobile app. While this could help shoppers navigate thousands of reviews and improve accessibility, some experts raise concerns. They question whether the AI can capture the nuance of human reviews or if it might blend marketing language with genuine user feedback, potentially diluting the unique insights that make customer reviews valuable.</p>

          <p>Social justice activist Reverend William Barber has strongly condemned the "brutal, ugly" assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, while also calling for a universal denunciation of all political violence. Speaking at an event, Barber criticized what he termed "religious nationalism," arguing against the use of religion to justify injustice or political division. He appeared to challenge the brand of Christianity espoused by Kirk and his allies, warning that it is dangerous when faith is used to "sanctify wrong."

The poll indicates a strong desire for change over experience, which has hurt incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani holds a significant advantage among voters who prioritize the cost of living and those who want a mayor who will oppose President Trump. While crime is a concern for some voters, who tend to favor Cuomo, economic issues currently dominate the political landscape of the race.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential long-term effects of the federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., arguing it may prove counterproductive despite short-term crime declines. The author suggests the heavy presence of federal agents and the National Guard is damaging the local economy, as residents and tourists stay home, and immigrant communities fear ICE. Furthermore, the crackdown could erode trust between residents and local police, making future community-based policing more difficult. The article posits that by disrupting the city and undermining community relations, the intervention could ultimately lead to the very disorder it claims to be fighting.</p>

          <p>After a difficult start to 2025, Tesla's stock has rebounded significantly, rising 85% from its low point in April to turn positive for the year. The recovery was bolstered by a recent filing showing CEO Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares. Despite an ongoing sales slump and increased competition, Wall Street's sentiment has improved, partly due to a proposed new pay plan for Musk and growth in the company's energy storage division. The company continues to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots to counter concerns about its core electric vehicle business. (not investment advice)</p>
