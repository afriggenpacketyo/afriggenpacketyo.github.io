          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco issued an order preventing Secretary of State Marco Rubio from carrying out planned State Department downsizing.  This action is in accordance with a previous injunction issued last month. The judge stated that President Trump failed to seek Congressional cooperation for the government-wide cuts.  The State Department's attempt to bypass the injunction by claiming independent action was rejected by the court.</p>

          <p>A federal judge denied the release of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, despite a previous ruling against the Trump administration's efforts to detain him based on foreign policy concerns. The administration now seeks to detain him on alternative grounds related to his green-card application.  Khalil's lawyers argue this is a pretext for his detention due to his pro-Palestinian activism.  The ruling delays Khalil's release, preventing him from celebrating his first Father's Day with his newborn son.</p>
