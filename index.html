          <p>This article from ABC News details President Trump's conflicting statements regarding Medicaid. Despite repeatedly promising not to cut the program, the House Republicans' bill to fund his agenda proposes significant Medicaid reductions. The article highlights instances where Trump vowed to protect Medicaid, even suggesting a veto if cuts were included, while simultaneously acknowledging the need to address fraud and abuse within the system. This discrepancy is drawing criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who argue that the proposed changes would negatively impact vulnerable Americans' access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, slightly below economists' expectations but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were primary drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, though the April data may not fully reflect these effects due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The Federal Reserve is expected to remain cautious in cutting interest rates as it assesses the impact of trade policies on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pandora, the world's largest jewelry company, is preparing to raise prices and reroute shipments in response to President Trump's tariffs. The company, which manufactures its products in Thailand, faces potential costs of millions of dollars due to the tariffs. CEO Alexander Lacik is weighing options such as passing the costs on to U.S. consumers or spreading the price increases globally. Pandora is also streamlining its supply chain to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, but moving production to the United States is not being considered due to higher labor costs.

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players, reversing their permanent ineligibility due to gambling scandals. This decision now makes them eligible for the sport's Hall of Fame. Rose's reinstatement comes after his death, a day before the Cincinnati Reds plan to honor him. While the decision is welcomed by some, the Hall of Fame's rules regarding integrity and character may still prevent their induction. Rose's past off-the-field issues, including statutory rape allegations and tax evasion, further complicate his candidacy.</p>
