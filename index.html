          <p>The Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks 114-109 in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, taking a 2-0 series lead. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with a playoff career-high of 39 points, supported by Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton. The Knicks, despite Jalen Brunson's 36 points, struggled with turnovers and defensive lapses, allowing the Pacers to control the game, particularly in the fourth quarter. With the series shifting to Indiana, the Knicks face an uphill battle to overcome the deficit and secure their first NBA Finals appearance in decades.</p>

While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails the initiative as a pioneering model, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing of the model before national rollout, given the complexities of separating physical and mental health issues.</p>

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stressed the importance of EU-US trade relations being guided by respect rather than threats, asserting the EU's readiness to defend its interests. European governments have cautioned that increased tariffs would harm both sides, advocating for negotiations as the only sustainable path forward, while maintaining readiness to respond if necessary.</p>

          <p>Many women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of PMS, are delaying or avoiding pregnancy due to the challenges of managing their symptoms while trying to conceive and during pregnancy. Contraceptive pills are a common treatment for PMDD, but they pose a dilemma for women who want to have children. Some women are turning to antidepressants, but these medications may also need to be discontinued during pregnancy. Experts emphasize the need for more research into PMDD to provide women with more treatment options and better support.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices for consumers. The aim is to make rice available in stores for 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms, addressing concerns over soaring prices and inflation. The government will begin procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in supermarkets reached a record high in early May, prompting criticism of the government's handling of the situation.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, a move touted to create jobs and boost the economy. Both companies welcomed the decision, which followed a review by federal agencies. Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The acquisition, previously opposed by Trump and President Biden, has been a significant bilateral issue between the U.S. and Japan.</p>

          <p>Germany often touts its efforts to confront its Nazi past, but this reckoning is often selective and contradictory. While Germany condemns the past when it is convenient, it often ignores injustices or atrocities committed by its allies or enabled by its own historical entanglements. This is exemplified by the continued honoring of figures like Herbert Quandt, an early SS supporter, and the failure to fully address the legacies of wealthy families who profited from Nazi collaboration and forced labor. The article argues that Germany's 'never again' promise is being reduced to a slogan, observed only when convenient.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited controversy, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties. Despite a recent pause on automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., a private organization operating facial recognition cameras, authorities used the technology to recapture one fugitive. Critics argue that live facial recognition poses a threat to fundamental rights and is an unwarranted escalation of surveillance. The debate highlights the need for clear regulations and oversight to protect citizens' privacy while leveraging technology for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
