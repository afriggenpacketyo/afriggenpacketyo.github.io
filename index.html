          <p>Eight critically endangered Fijian iguanas, rescued from wildlife traffickers in Spain, have arrived at the San Diego Zoo, which houses the largest captive colony of these reptiles. The iguanas were seized in a 2017 bust and their relocation to San Diego was authorized by the Fiji government as part of an international effort to restore the endangered species. The zoo will analyze the iguanas' DNA to determine their origin and whether they were poached or bred illegally, aiding conservation efforts.</p>
