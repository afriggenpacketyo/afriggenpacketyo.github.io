          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from hurricane strength off Mexico's Pacific coast, now carrying maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. Despite its diminished intensity, the storm is still generating high surf conditions and gusty winds across Baja California Sur, prompting a tropical storm watch from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. Forecasters predict Priscilla will continue to weaken over the next two days while remaining offshore, moving northwest. However, the National Hurricane Center warns that the large swells produced by Priscilla are likely to cause dangerous rip currents, life-threatening surf, and coastal flooding along affected Mexican coastlines, emphasizing the ongoing risk to public safety.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty in Alexandria, Virginia, to federal charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation stemming from his September 2020 testimony. The Justice Department's indictment of Comey, a prominent critic of former President Trump, marks a significant escalation in efforts against political foes. His defense team plans to challenge the indictment, alleging vindictive prosecution and questioning the legality of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment, who previously served as Trump's personal attorney. The case, which could involve classified information and has a trial date set for early January, highlights the ongoing political and legal battles surrounding the former FBI chief's tenure and subsequent interactions with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning to decorate for the holidays should consider shopping early, as a leading artificial Christmas tree importer forecasts significant shortages across various seasonal decorative items, including lights and wreaths. Trade war tariffs are cited as the primary cause, resulting in a substantial 25% decrease in product imports and a 10% hike in prices, which may disproportionately affect economically vulnerable consumers. Despite efforts to bring in some inventory later into November, overall import volumes for peak season months are strikingly low, indicating reduced availability. Industry leaders are actively lobbying the Trump administration to mitigate these trade issues, hoping to secure better prices and supply for future holiday seasons, underscoring the broader economic impact of current trade policies on consumer goods.</p>

          <p>A pro-Palestinian demonstration in downtown Boston quickly devolved into a riot, resulting in 13 arrests following violent confrontations with police officers. The event, organized by local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters, marked the two-year anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack. According to the Boston Police Department, protesters surrounded police vehicles, kicked doors, resisted dispersal, and deployed smoke devices and flares, with several officers reportedly assaulted and their equipment forcibly removed or damaged. Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu strongly condemned the violence, asserting that individuals involved in attacking police would face full prosecution under the law, reinforcing the city's stance against such disruptive and dangerous behavior.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a peculiar case challenging Illinois voting regulations, where Republican Rep. Michael Bost sued over the state's 14-day mail-in ballot counting period, despite having won his election. Justices, both conservative and liberal, appeared skeptical of arguments from both sides. Bost's counsel contended harm from a reduced victory margin and increased staff costs, but Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kagan questioned the premise of a winning candidate suing. The Illinois Solicitor General also faced difficulties defending her stance that only candidates with a realistic chance of winning should have standing, with Justice Roberts calling her proposal a "potential disaster." The article underscores the Court's nuanced approach to election law and standing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is slated for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday, his second such medical evaluation since reassuming the presidency in January. His previous annual physical in April, which encompassed cognitive and cardiology assessments, concluded he was "fully fit to execute the duties" of his office, with his physician noting his "frequent victories in golf events" contributed to excellent wellbeing. Recent images of a purplish bruise on his hand, attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, have sparked public health speculation. The White House also indicated Trump might travel to the Middle East soon after his checkup, potentially to finalize a Gaza peace agreement.</p>

Federal marshals and local police deployed gas into the residence before discovering him, highlighting the elaborate nature of his evasion. This arrest concludes a significant multi-agency effort to bring all escapees back into custody, while also drawing attention to design and security failures at the Orleans Parish Justice Center.

The article advocates for political leaders to set higher standards for public behavior and discourse, rather than contributing to the vulgarization of the political culture that has evolved over the last three decades.

The pipeline, designed to carry oil from Alberta to Nebraska, has a contentious history, having been approved by Canada but subsequently blocked by both the Obama and Biden administrations due to environmental opposition.

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator firmly rejected concerns about "circular investments" in the artificial intelligence sector, labeling the narrative as "fundamentally flawed" during an interview. Intrator clarified that major technology companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, are actively acquiring AI cloud infrastructure to fulfill genuine client demand, characterizing this activity as a crucial "fundamental infrastructure buildout." CoreWeave, which experienced a stock surge of over 200% since its IPO earlier this year, recently secured a substantial $22.4 billion expansion with OpenAI and a $14.2 billion deal with Meta, in addition to a significant order from investor and chipmaker Nvidia. The article highlights the CEO's confidence in the market's enormous underlying drivers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Writer Alex O’Keefe, known for his work on "The Bear," has seen a civil summons for alleged disorderly conduct dismissed by a New York City administrative judge, bringing an end to a widely publicized incident on a Metro-North train. O’Keefe, who is Black, had posted videos last month showing him being handcuffed by MTA police after a white woman complained about his seating, alleging he was targeted due to his race. Police stated O’Keefe occupied two seats and refused to follow directions, causing a six-minute service delay. O’Keefe reiterated that he was "harassed and detained for sitting while Black," with his legal team hailing the dismissal as a just outcome that affirms his innocence.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reported that a persistent shortage of air traffic controllers is significantly contributing to flight delays across the U.S., a problem exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport experienced half-hour delays specifically due to staffing issues, and while overall disruptions saw a decrease on Wednesday, thousands of flights were affected earlier in the week. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted a "slight uptick" in sick calls among air traffic controllers, who, as "essential" workers, are continuing to work demanding 10-hour shifts, six days a week, without pay. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association emphasized the extraordinary dedication of its members amidst the strain, highlighting the urgent need for a resolution to the funding lapse.</p>

Today, the extensive collection is notably divided between the Palace Museum in Beijing and the National Palace Museum in Taipei, with additional branches in Chiayi and Hong Kong.

          <p>Arizona's Democratic Senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego publicly confronted House Speaker Mike Johnson, urging him to swear in Adelita Grijalva, their state's newly elected Democratic representative. Johnson, however, refused to budge, linking the swearing-in to the ongoing government shutdown and demanding that funding be restored first. Grijalva's official entry into the House is particularly significant because her vote could provide the final signature needed to force a floor vote on legislation to release files related to the late alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson dismissed the senators' claims of a connection to the Epstein vote as "totally absurd" and a "publicity stunt," underscoring the deep partisan gridlock affecting both legislative function and accountability.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem generated significant controversy at a White House roundtable by directly comparing antifa to internationally designated terrorist organizations like MS-13, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Islamic State. She asserted that the loosely affiliated network of antifascist activists is "just as dangerous" and shares an agenda to "destroy us." This comparison, made during an event attended by right-wing social media journalists, contrasts sharply with expert consensus, which describes antifa as a decentralized movement lacking the command structures, military wings, or territorial control of the other groups cited. The article underscores the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to officially designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, despite widespread criticism regarding the accuracy and implications of such a classification.</p>

Driven by scientific studies linking these foods to health issues like obesity and asthma in children, the article emphasizes the personal motivation of Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, a father of three. The law aims to overhaul school cafeteria meals, with vendors prohibited from selling banned items to districts by 2032.</p>

          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily lifted a lower court's order specifically blocking the deployment of the Oregon National Guard to Portland. However, this administrative stay does not change the on-the-ground situation, as a broader, more sweeping order from U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut remains in effect, prohibiting any state's National Guard from deploying into the city. The appeals court issued the stay to preserve the status quo while it deliberates, without assessing the legal merits. Immergut's initial ruling found that conditions in Portland did not justify a federal takeover of the National Guard, calling the president's claims "untethered to the facts."</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced the furlough of nearly half its workforce, approximately 34,000 employees, directly attributing the decision to the ongoing government shutdown. This drastic measure will significantly hinder taxpayer assistance, leading to increased wait times, mounting backlogs, and delays in implementing tax law changes, especially critical as the extended tax-filing deadline looms. The furloughed staff, considered "non-essential," will enter a non-pay and non-duty status, although the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 typically guarantees back pay post-shutdown. The National Treasury Employees Union strongly condemned this action, emphasizing the severe detriment to vital services for the American public and the broader functionality of the IRS.</p>
