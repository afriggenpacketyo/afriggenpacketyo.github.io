        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a meeting with a Japanese delegation, President Trump's briefing card for a major trade deal showed significant last-minute alterations made with a marker. The card displayed a 10% tariff crossed out and replaced with 15%, and a $400 billion investment figure was changed to $500 billion. However, Trump later announced a different investment number of $550 billion on social media, creating confusion among officials and on Wall Street. The White House and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did not clarify the discrepancies, attributing the final terms to Trump's direct negotiation style during the meeting.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing hearing for Bryan Kohberger, who murdered four University of Idaho students, the two surviving roommates shared powerful victim impact statements. Dylan Mortensen spoke through tears about how the crime shattered her ability to trust and forced her to learn how to survive unimaginable trauma. A statement from Bethany Funke, read by a friend, described her ongoing fear and the profound loss of her friends, who she said she would keep living for. Both roommates detailed the immense psychological toll and guilt they have endured since the 2022 attack.</p>

          <h2>Germany Urges U.S. for Assurances on Patriot Missile System Replacements for Ukraine</h2>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is calling on the Trump administration to provide "watertight" guarantees regarding the replacement of Patriot air-defense systems sent to Ukraine. Under a proposed arrangement, European allies would send their own U.S.-made Patriot systems to Ukraine, and the U.S. would then replenish the allies' stocks. Pistorius expressed concern that this could create security gaps for NATO, emphasizing the need for a clear timeframe of six to eight months for the replacements to arrive. This comes as Germany has committed to providing five of its own Patriot systems to aid Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>The German government has officially approved the export of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Turkey, resolving a lengthy period of uncertainty. A government spokesman confirmed the decision, which was made by Germany's Federal Security Council, the body responsible for approving arms exports. Turkey had long been negotiating to purchase the jets, which are produced by a consortium including Germany, the UK, Italy, and Spain. Shortly after the German approval was reported, Turkey and the UK signed a memorandum of understanding to proceed with the acquisition of the fighter jets.</p>

          <p>Two ships collided in the German North Sea port of Cuxhaven, resulting in an estimated 6,000 liters of oil spilling into the harbor. The incident involved the tanker Capella and the offshore supply vessel Coastal Legend, prompting a large-scale cleanup operation with oil booms to contain the slick. Authorities believe the tanker's captain misjudged the situation, and there are no indications of a technical fault. Environmental groups have expressed serious concern over the potential for severe ecological damage, while shipping traffic on the Elbe River remains unaffected by the cleanup efforts.</p>

          <p>Homeowners finding it difficult to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) due to higher interest rates and stricter lending standards have several alternative options. Lending experts suggest first understanding the specific reason for denial, which could be a high debt-to-income ratio, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. Improving one's financial profile by reducing debt and boosting credit can increase approval odds. Alternative financing products include fixed-rate home equity loans, cash-out refinances, personal loans, or, for smaller projects, a 0% APR credit card for disciplined borrowers.

The author argues that Trump's actions, such as denying he wrote a note in Epstein's scrapbook, attempting to kill the story, and deflecting questions by attacking political rivals, appear evasive rather than indicative of innocence. The piece suggests that by comparing the Epstein situation to other "witch hunts" like the 2020 election, Trump is leaning into a pattern of denial rather than providing straightforward answers. The author concludes that Trump is acting guilty, possibly because he is.</p>

          <p>An Afghan translator who aided U.S. troops and was granted a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Connecticut. The 35-year-old man, identified as Zia S., was arrested during a routine biometrics appointment for his green card application. He had legally entered the U.S. with his family in 2024 after fleeing the Taliban. Members of Congress and advocates have condemned the detention as a violation of promises made to allies who risked their lives for the U.S., while DHS claims he is under investigation for a "serious criminal allegation."</p>

Gergiev was scheduled to conduct at the Reggia di Caserta palace near Naples, but the venue canceled the event amid criticism from Italian lawmakers and Russian dissidents, including Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Alexey Navalny. This is the latest in a series of cancellations for Gergiev, who has lost engagements at major venues like Carnegie Hall for refusing to denounce Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

GoPro's stock jumped 56%, while Krispy Kreme's rose 18%, driven by speculative buying from the same cohort that fueled the GameStop mania. Both companies are considered cheap stocks with relatively high short interest, making them attractive targets for traders aiming to trigger a short squeeze. This heightened speculative activity coincides with a broader market rally, as investors feel relief over recent economic data and tariff news. (not investment advice)</p>

The tomb, which has housed the preserved body of the Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin since his death in 1924, was a major pilgrimage site in the Soviet era but saw interest wane after the USSR's collapse. The current surge is seen less as Soviet nostalgia and more as a final opportunity for people to see the historical curiosity, especially as there has been ongoing public debate for years about finally burying Lenin's body.</p>

The tiny reptile, which can fit on a coin and grows to a maximum of four inches, was found by a research team under a rock in a small forest patch on the island. The species is blind, burrows for termites and ants, and was feared to be extinct. Its rediscovery is considered significant for local conservation efforts, as many of Barbados's other endemic species have already been lost due to habitat destruction.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China has called for a significant "rebalancing" of the economic partnership. Jens Eskelund stated that while the relationship has created enormous value for both sides over the past five decades, it has reached a tipping point. He warned that intense pressure from Chinese competition leading to losses for European companies could undermine the foundation of the partnership. This call for a more equitable model comes amid growing trade tensions and a more assertive U.S. trade policy under President Trump.</p>

          <p>With household debt climbing due to high interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments, experts outline several debt relief strategies. For disciplined individuals, the debt avalanche method, which prioritizes paying off high-interest debt first, can save the most money over time. Debt consolidation, using tools like a personal loan or a 0% APR balance transfer card, can lower interest costs and simplify payments. For those with more severe struggles, a non-profit credit counselor can arrange a debt management plan, while debt settlement or bankruptcy remain options for overwhelming situations.

The decision has caused concern among corn farmers and manufacturers of corn syrup, who warn of potential job losses.

          <p>Financial experts are analyzing the potential effects of President Trump's proposed "One Big Beautiful Act" tax law on upper-middle-class families. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase the standard deduction, and expand the Child Tax Credit. However, analysts suggest the benefits for those earning between $117,000 and $150,000 are mixed. While a higher standard deduction helps, the continued $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions and a lower mortgage interest deduction limit could offset gains, particularly for homeowners in high-tax states.

This would paradoxically drive up long-term interest rates for mortgages and car loans, harming the very consumers and businesses the policy intended to help. (not investment advice)</p>
