            <p>A senior official within the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) was found to have breached the organization's ethics code following an investigation into their behavior at a social event. The official, identified as 'AB,' allegedly spent an excessive amount of time with a volunteer, raising concerns among witnesses who felt the behavior could bring the CGF into disrepute. The ethics commission chair emphasized that CGF officials must exemplify integrity and avoid any appearance of impropriety, concluding that AB's actions denigrated the perception of the organization's integrity.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors in Los Angeles County are seeking a pause in the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. The DA's office filed a motion to delay the hearing pending review of a recently completed parole board risk assessment, ordered by California Governor Gavin Newsom as part of a clemency appeal. The DA argues that the court should have access to the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions. The Menendez brothers' attorney maintains that justice is prevailing over politics in the case.</p>

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump amidst escalating trade tensions between the United States and the European Union.

            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a first-quarter profit exceeding expectations, driven by strong demand for AI chips. The company's net income increased by 60.3% year-over-year, benefiting from its role as a key manufacturer for companies like Nvidia. However, TSMC faces headwinds from U.S. trade policies, including tariffs on Taiwanese goods and export controls on clients like Nvidia and AMD. TSMC is investing heavily in overseas facilities, including a significant expansion in the U.S., partly in response to these trade pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A top researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) resigned, accusing aides to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of censorship. Dr. Kevin Hall claims he was blocked from giving an interview about his research on ultra-processed foods and that his written answers were edited without his consent. He also alleges he was prevented from presenting his research at a conference and given an ultimatum regarding edits to a manuscript. An HHS spokesperson denies the allegations.</p>

            <p>Newspaper front pages are dominated by the Supreme Court's ruling defining women by biological sex under equalities law, sparking debate about the implications for single-sex spaces. Headlines range from celebrating a 'victory for women' to highlighting 'equity policies in chaos,' with organizations across Britain told to revisit their equality policies. The ruling has prompted calls for the UK's laws on gender recognition to be rewritten, while also raising concerns about potential discrimination against trans women.</p>

            <p>Gold prices have surged to a new record high as investors grow increasingly concerned about the impact of the trade war between the US and China. The precious metal is viewed as a safe haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, and its rise reflects fears of slower growth and higher prices due to President Trump's tariff policies. The Federal Reserve chair warned that the tariffs are likely to worsen inflation, further driving investors towards gold. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide power outage, affecting as many as 1.4 million customers.

            <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem canceled $2.7 million in DHS grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about anti-American ideology on campus.

The DHS action follows President Trump's decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard and ask the IRS to revoke its tax-exempt status, reflecting a broader federal crackdown on campus antisemitism and ideological bias.</p>

The leaders also sparred over their economic policies and their ability to protect Canadian jobs in the face of US trade pressures.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of boxes of food from previously reinstated orders remain stuck in the United States, with no shipping contracts awarded, threatening the lives of countless children in need.</p>
