          <p>Mortgage application volume saw a significant increase last week, rising by 12.5% after adjustments for the Memorial Day holiday, although overall volume remains low historically. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances saw a slight increase, while rates for 15-year fixed loans and Federal Housing Administration loans decreased slightly. Refinance applications increased by 16% for the week, and purchase applications rose by 10%, driven by loosening housing inventory in certain markets. Despite economic uncertainty, homebuyers are capitalizing on increased housing supply, but upcoming inflation data and trade talks with China could impact bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An expert on pop music explores the theory of "recession pop," which posits that upbeat, bubblegum pop music becomes popular during times of economic hardship. This trend supposedly emerged during the Great Recession, with artists like Katy Perry and Black Eyed Peas dominating the charts. However, the expert argues that music is diverse and reflects a range of emotions, not just upbeat attitudes, and that the idea of "recession pop" is a recent invention. The current interest in recession pop might be more about millennials aging and asserting their cultural preferences, rather than a direct reflection of the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have prohibited teaching antisemitism in public schools and universities, arguing that it would unfairly target teachers with potential lawsuits. The bill would have banned educators from teaching or promoting antisemitism, with violators facing personal liability for damages in lawsuits. Hobbs stated that antisemitism is a serious issue but believes the bill is an attack on educators, and that there are already existing channels to report antisemitism. Republican Representative Michael Way, the bill's sponsor, called the veto "disgraceful," while opponents argued the bill could silence discussions on Palestinian oppression.</p>

A mother of two, fearing for her children's safety after her home was damaged, is considering moving back to Bulgaria.

          <p>Downtown LA is under curfew for the first time since anti-ICE protests began, with city officials citing vandalism and looting as the reason. The Trump administration has moved forward with deploying Marines and National Guard troops, despite objections from state and city officials, stating their mission is to protect federal facilities and employees. Meanwhile, an appeal hearing is scheduled for Trump's criminal conviction and sentencing in a federal court of appeals in Manhattan, involving hush money payments made before the 2016 election. High-profile raids on farms, construction sites, and restaurants has prompted many workers to go into hiding.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are recovering strongly in 2025, with registrations up 20% from January to April, driven by corporate sales and new EV models. However, consumer skepticism about EVs persists, and charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier, needing significant expansion to meet future demand. Tesla's sales have plummeted, while Chinese brands are gaining ground due to heavy state subsidies, leading to a shift in the European auto market. Automakers push for flexibility over emissions.

          <p>The Simpsons, despite initial criticism for its irreverent humor, is examined for its underlying moral integrity and its reflection of typical middle-American family values. The show faced backlash from conservative figures like James Dobson and Barbara Bush, but it ultimately demonstrated a wholesome core through stories of family love, reconciliation, and ethical choices. George H. W. Bush's attempt to contrast The Simpsons with The Waltons backfired, highlighting his disconnect with many voters who saw their own family struggles reflected in the show. The show understood itself better than the president did.</p>
