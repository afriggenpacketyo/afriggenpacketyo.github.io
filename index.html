          <p>President Trump's four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE was filled with fanfare and significant economic agreements, including a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange" with Qatar and a $600 billion investment promise from Saudi Arabia. These deals, while potentially overblown, signaled the Gulf states' eagerness to partner with the U.S. in business, military, and technology sectors. Trump also met with Syriaâ€™s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing previous U.S. policy and lifting sanctions, while suggesting progress in nuclear talks with Iran, but largely sidestepped the conflict in Gaza. This trip underscored Trump's 'business-first' approach and a move away from American interventionist foreign policy. </p>

          <p>Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the start of the war, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio present for initial discussions. Despite Trump's call for direct negotiations, expectations for a breakthrough remain low, as both sides continue to trade accusations and unverified claims about casualties. The Trump administration has cast doubt on the talks' prospects, but the meeting is viewed as an attempt by Putin to maintain Trump's attention and convince the White House that he is not obstructing peace efforts. </p>

The proposal emphasizes the need to address UAP as realistic and serious national security concerns, calling for a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. The lawmakers propose regular reporting to parliament, public disclosure of information, and scientific analysis of collected data to identify potential threats.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike due to disagreements over pay raises, causing a complete shutdown of rail service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters. The union claims workers haven't received a pay raise in five years, while NJ Transit maintains their offer was fair and fiscally responsible. A contingency plan involving additional bus service will be implemented on Monday, but it is expected to accommodate only 20% of displaced train riders. This marks the first NJ Transit strike since 1983, with commuters advised to work from home or use alternative transportation options. </p>

This growth is attributed to a strong and loyal customer base in China and the popularity of its Pura 70 and Mate 70 series smartphones.

          <p>An autopsy report suggests that President Biden may have been experiencing cognitive decline before assuming office, challenging the notion that he was fully capable at the start of his presidency. The report cites recordings from 2017 indicating struggles with memory and speech, and reports from the 2020 campaign reveal efforts to edit videos to compensate for his cognitive state. The analysis raises questions about whether Biden was fit for office and highlights the potential for unelected staff to exert undue influence. It also touches on the Democratic Party's efforts to support Biden's candidacy despite concerns about his abilities. </p>

          <p>A recent trend indicates that Gen Z men are becoming more religiously affiliated, particularly with Christianity, while young women are increasingly leaving religious congregations. This divergence is contributing to a growing political gender gap, as young men find faith and their politics shift to the right, while young women's beliefs clash with religious customs. The study shows that religious customs are not jibing with their political and social beliefs, pushing them out of churches, and reinforcing that drift away from some organized religions. This shift complicates electoral choices, family life, and social belonging. </p>

          <p>Scientists have uncovered the complex fluid dynamics behind flamingos' unique feeding behavior, revealing that the birds create vortices in the water to trap prey. By bobbing their heads, chattering their bills, and stomping their feet, flamingos generate tiny tornadoes that stir up and concentrate shrimp and algae. The shape of their bill creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water. This research may have implications for improving water filtration technologies, as chemists are exploring flamingo-inspired techniques to keep filters clear of debris. </p>

          <p>NJ Transit engineers are on strike as of 12:01 a.m. Friday, the union says, bringing train service to a screeching halt. NJ Transit rail service is fully shutdown, along with Metro-North's west of Hudson service. The strike is expected to inconvenience more than 300,000 daily commuters. NJ Transit suggests people work from home, if possible, and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says all options are on the table, even a state of emergency. The agency and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) have been at odds over pay raises. The union, which represents about 460 engineers, says the competition pays more and the cost of living has gone up. </p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, framed as a "bonus" to help retirees keep more money. The change is presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a promise made by President Trump. The deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes above $75,000 and married couples above $150,000. While this tax deduction would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, experts note it's not as generous as a tax credit. </p>
