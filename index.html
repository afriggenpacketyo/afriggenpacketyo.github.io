          <p>Hong Kong is positioned to significantly enhance its role as a regional "superconnector" by formally joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade bloc. ASEAN economic ministers have affirmed their desire to accelerate Hong Kong's inclusion, recognizing the city's deep existing trade ties, with RCEP members constituting a substantial portion of its merchandise and service trade. Accession would systematically lower trade barriers, aiming to eliminate 90% of tariffs over the next two decades, thereby bolstering market attractiveness across Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania for Hong Kong businesses. This strategic move is expected to considerably reduce overhead costs and logistical obstacles for SMEs, increase the inflow of high-quality consumer goods, and lower manufacturing expenses for downstream firms, benefiting both industries and consumers alike.</p>

          <p>The FBI reportedly analyzed phone records of nearly a dozen Republican lawmakers in 2023 during its investigation into former President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This scrutiny, which included call logs and metadata for figures like Senators Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley, covered several days around January 6, 2021, but did not access conversation content. Republican senators, including Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley, disclosed this information, condemning it as a profound violation of constitutional rights and an abuse of power. The investigative step, authorized by a grand jury, adds new context to the now-shuttered federal probe, prompting calls for a full investigation into who authorized and approved the surveillance of political opponents.</p>

          <p>The Syrian army and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have reached a ceasefire agreement in two districts of Aleppo city, following a recent escalation of tensions. This development comes after the Syrian Defence Ministry redeployed forces along frontlines with the Kurdish-led group, citing a need to prevent attacks and territorial seizures, despite a landmark integration deal signed in March. Sporadic clashes and accusations of provocations had intensified, with the SDF accusing government factions of attempting to enter Kurdish-held areas with tanks. The ceasefire aims to de-escalate the situation and revive efforts to implement the stalled March agreement, which sought to unify the fractured country.</p>

          <p>Bill Nye, along with hundreds of advocates, protested proposed 25% budget cuts to NASA for fiscal year 2026, warning that such reductions would cause the U.S. to cede leadership in space exploration to other nations, particularly China. Nye, CEO of The Planetary Society, emphasized that NASA's budget is a tiny fraction of the federal budget, yet yields extraordinary returns, including technological advancements like GPS and digital cameras. He highlighted the risk to critical missions like the Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, and stressed the historical impact of finding extraterrestrial life. Investing in NASA is deemed "priceless" due to its economic multiplier effect and contributions to global knowledge.</p>

Although Priscilla is expected to remain offshore, heavy rains of 2-4 inches, with isolated totals up to 6 inches, are anticipated in southwestern Mexico, posing a flash flooding risk, especially in higher terrain. Swells generated by the hurricane are also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast, urging residents to exercise caution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would consider pardons for convicted sexual trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell and hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs. Maxwell, who conspired with Jeffrey Epstein, recently had her Supreme Court appeal denied, making a presidential pardon her best chance for early release from a 2040 sentence. Trump claimed he had not heard Maxwell's name in a long time, despite the case's high profile, and said he would need to consult the DOJ. He also mentioned Combs, who was recently sentenced for a federal prostitution conviction, had requested a pardon. These comments come amidst renewed scrutiny of Trump's past ties to Epstein.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively working to broaden its financial market's "connector" role beyond just mainland China, aspiring to become the leading financing hub for the entire Asia-Pacific region. A prominent banker from Citic stated that the city aims to attract listings and capital from top-tier companies across diverse markets like India, Southeast Asia, Japan, and Singapore. Hong Kong's unique advantages, including its deep fundraising pool, high degree of capital freedom, and the "one country, two systems" principle, offer an unparalleled platform for linking various Asian economies with global investors. This strategic evolution is particularly relevant as mainland capital increasingly flows into the city amid ongoing US-China economic decoupling, solidifying Hong Kong's pivotal international financial intermediary position.</p>

The governor suggested these actions are a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act, which President Trump indicated he would consider if courts or local leaders impeded his efforts to ensure city safety.

However, the global picture is mixed, with developing countries, particularly China, leading the clean energy charge, while some richer nations increased their reliance on fossil fuels.

Researchers found that subjects had a 23% higher chance of an ALS diagnosis years later if exposed to elevated SO2 levels, even within Canada's clean air guidelines.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, found no evidence warranting federalized military presence and questioned efforts to circumvent her prior ruling. The Pentagon had reassigned 200 California Guard members to Portland, citing support for federal personnel. This legal battle is part of broader challenges to Trump's use of military force in cities, with Illinois also filing a lawsuit to prevent similar deployments. Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if courts or local officials impede his actions.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a foundational document outlining national development goals, there's a focus on supporting private enterprises. Many entrepreneurs, however, are experiencing fatigue from sluggish demand, intense price wars, and unexpected administrative penalties, with over 60% describing the business climate as "difficult." The government has launched numerous measures to ease conditions, but confidence remains low, and some industries face potential bankruptcies. The upcoming five-year plan aims to restore private sector confidence and enhance competitiveness, addressing concerns like securing financing, which often favors state-owned competitors.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier publicly lambasted WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, accusing her of "the worst leadership in the world" and jeopardizing player safety through poor officiating. Collier, also a vice president of the WNBA Players Association, highlighted the league's lack of accountability despite surging popularity, rising valuations, and a new media-rights deal. She revealed Engelbert allegedly told her star players should be "grateful" for the league's platform, rather than demanding higher salaries or a greater share of revenue. Collier's "scorched-earth" criticism underscores deep player dissatisfaction with compensation and well-being, signaling a critical juncture for the league as labor negotiations continue.</p>

          <p>A former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor of Public Safety, Brian Williams, was sentenced to one year of probation and 50 hours of community service for calling in a fake bomb threat to City Hall. Williams admitted to making the false report last October, claiming an unknown man threatened to bomb the building due to anti-Israel sentiment. His defense attributed the act to "undiagnosed mental health challenges" stemming from personal tragedies, for which he has since sought treatment. Prosecutors acknowledged his distinguished public service but emphasized the threat diverted police resources and created a dangerous environment, betraying public trust.</p>

          <p>Arkansas officials have shot and killed a male black bear believed to be responsible for the fatal mauling of a 60-year-old Missouri man at his campsite in the Ozark National Forest. The victim, Max Thomas, was discovered dead outside Sam's Throne campground after his son reported not hearing from him, and evidence of a struggle was found. Authorities identified the bear through trail camera footage and its resemblance to photos taken by the victim. This incident marks the second fatal bear attack in Arkansas in recent weeks, though wildlife ecologists emphasize such occurrences are "exceedingly rare." DNA samples will confirm the bear's involvement.</p>

          <p>Top Trump advisors, including Stephen Miller and Russ Vought, have intensified extreme rhetoric against Democrats amidst the ongoing government shutdown and federal immigration raids. Miller declared a "large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism," advocating for "legitimate state power to dismantle terror networks," while Vought used an AI video to depict mass firings of federal workers. This rhetoric coincides with federal efforts to deploy military forces in cities and a sweeping deportation campaign, which a federal judge, Karin Immergut, deemed "untethered to the facts." The administration's actions and language are escalating political tensions, challenging constitutional norms, and raising concerns about civil liberties and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservatives have announced plans to abolish the Sentencing Council, a non-departmental public body that sets guidelines for courts in England and Wales. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick will outline proposals to give ministers direct power over sentencing policy, arguing the current council is "not fit for purpose" and creates inconsistent justice. This move follows a public dispute earlier this year between the council and the government over pre-sentence reports. The Conservatives believe the council has watered down sentences and that parliamentarians, accountable to the people, should determine sentencing. The party aims to introduce new legislation to implement these changes.</p>

          <p>A career federal prosecutor in Virginia, Elizabeth Yusi, reportedly believes there is no probable cause to file criminal mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, despite pressure from former President Trump. This sets up a potential confrontation with Lindsey Halligan, a Trump ally recently installed as the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, who has previously secured an indictment against former FBI director James Comey under similar pressure. Trump has openly called for James's prosecution after her civil fraud case against him. Evidence, including emails, suggests James did not intend to use the property as her primary residence, making a knowing lie difficult to prove.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's decision to forgo its "developing country" status at the WTO, which entitled it to special trade privileges, is seen as a strategic maneuver rather than a capitulation. Through the lens of Mao Zedong’s protracted war theory, this move is a "strategic defensive" to outlast stronger adversaries like the U.S. and EU. By relinquishing these benefits, China removes a key talking point used by Washington and Brussels, which highlighted the inconsistency of a hi-tech powerhouse claiming the same benefits as poorer nations. This tactical retreat allows China to reframe the global trade battlefield, aligning itself with the Global South while conceding minimal substance. (not investment advice)</p>

This data, from the Department of Commerce, includes both new and returning students, with August arrivals typically indicating fall semester enrollment. China and India, the largest sources, saw declines of 12.4% and 44.5% respectively. Many international students are opting to stay outside the U.S. during breaks due to fears of re-entry issues, contributing to this significant decrease.
