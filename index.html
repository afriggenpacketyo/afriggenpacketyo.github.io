            <p>According to reports, the Trump administration intends to pull $1 billion in federal funding from Harvard University due to the ongoing public dispute between the institution and the administration. The funding cut is said to be related to health research funding. This development follows previous actions, including a request to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and a review of federal contracts. The move comes after Trump criticized Harvard for allegedly promoting woke ideologies and failing to address antisemitism on campus. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the US and imprisoned in El Salvador in exchange for Venezuela releasing the same number of political prisoners. Bukele directly appealed to Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro via social media, citing humanitarian grounds for the proposed agreement. The offer comes amid concerns about the treatment of Venezuelan deportees in El Salvador's high-security Terrorism Confinement Center, where they are being held after being accused by the Trump administration of gang membership. The Venezuelan government has yet to publicly respond to Bukele's proposal.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," or nonsexual unions based on companionship and practical benefits, are gaining traction. These arrangements cater to individuals who may not fit traditional marital expectations due to their sexual orientation or personal preferences. A Tokyo-based agency has facilitated over 300 such marriages in the past decade, providing an alternative for those seeking a life partner without romantic or sexual intimacy. While diverse values are spreading in Japan, the lack of recognition for same-sex marriage means the socially accepted belief that "men and women should marry and have children" is still predominant.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which has now expired. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian troops had violated the ceasefire nearly 3,000 times since the start of Sunday. Russia's defense ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. The BBC has not independently verified claims by the warring sides. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump - who has been pushing for an end to the war - said that "hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week", without giving further details.</p>

He seeks to appeal to the common American while simultaneously emphasizing a vision of himself as an exceptional figure. Trump's repetitive, short sentences and relentless self-promotion are reminiscent of his background as a businessman and TV star. He frequently refers to himself in the third person and uses the phrase "in the history of our country" often.</p>

            <p>Despite the promise of "free hours" of childcare in England, parents still face difficulties in finding nursery places, and experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for the funded hours and those missing out. Over the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined while demand is increasing. Private nurseries, which provide most early years places, are facing rising operating costs and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work. The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in OECD countries for many parents who cannot access the free hours.</p>

            <p>Men tend to visit doctors less often than women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become severe or unbearable. Societal expectations of masculinity, such as self-reliance and not showing vulnerability, contribute to this reluctance. A recent survey indicates that many men feel pressured to "tough it out" and fear being seen as weak if they discuss health concerns. Experts suggest that appointment systems and services should be redesigned to better meet men's needs, focusing on actions rather than just talking.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The court's order prevents the Trump administration from removing the detainees until further notice. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the AEA without providing due process. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. White House officials claim the men being held were "foreign terrorists."</p>

Verstappen was penalised for cutting the chicane after the start and keeping the lead. Piastri had got fully alongside him on the inside on the entry to the first corner.
