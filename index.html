          <h2>PKK Disbands After 41 Years, Impacting Turkish Politics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its disbandment after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a decision met with both celebration and uncertainty. Political experts suggest this move could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape, requiring parties to adapt their programs. The pro-Kurdish DEM party may see considerable changes, particularly regarding the release of jailed politicians. The article also addresses concerns about the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential impact on neighboring countries, specifically Syria and its Kurdish factions. Optimism surrounding the group's dissolution is tempered by internal resistance and the need for broader constitutional reforms within Turkey.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine are set to hold peace talks in Turkey, though President Putin's absence from the delegation suggests a lack of willingness to meet President Zelensky directly. Former President Trump had considered attending but will instead visit the UAE, sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his place. Zelensky stated he is awaiting to see who Russia sends before deciding on Ukraine's next steps. The article highlights the high stakes for both sides after three years of war, with Russia facing troop and equipment losses, and Ukraine needing security guarantees from the U.S. Despite previous cease-fire attempts failing, pressure for peace continues to mount.</p>

          <p>President Javier Milei of Argentina has issued a decree to tighten immigration policies, drawing comparisons to the Trump administration's approach. The new measures include stricter requirements for citizenship and permanent residency, as well as easier deportation processes. The government claims these changes will address 'chaos and abuse' by newcomers, while critics worry about the impact on Argentina's tradition of openness. The decree also mandates that foreigners pay for public health care and education, aiming to ensure the sustainability of these systems amidst government spending cuts.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic. The IMF expects Denmark's growth to moderate in the coming years but believes the country is shielded from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. This is due to Danish drugmakers relying on a 'merchanting and processing' system where manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF notes that heightened trade tensions pose risks but the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on the Danish economy is limited.</p>

The Qatari base houses 8,000 U.S. troops and has been significantly developed with Qatari investment.

This action supplements the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The rice shortage is partly due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased consumption from foreign tourists.

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a tax bill to cut billions in climate-related funding and roll back clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump's tax cuts. The bill targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, impacting renewable energy, manufacturing, and electric vehicles. The proposal also includes streamlining permits for fossil fuels and rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding. Concerns have been raised that these cuts would disrupt businesses, increase energy costs, and affect local economies in Republican districts.</p>
