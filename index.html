The flip-flopping of U.S. trade policy announcements has created uncertainty, while central bank meetings in Canada and the euro zone are expected to result in interest rate cuts. President Trump's announcement regarding semiconductor tariffs adds to the market's unease. Investors are closely monitoring these developments as they navigate the holiday-shortened week.

            <p>Potential Medicaid cuts being considered by Congress could significantly affect long-term care and family caregivers. Medicaid is the primary source of funding for long-term care for disabled and elderly individuals. Reductions in Medicaid services could lead to decreased access to essential care, increased burden on family caregivers, and potential institutionalization for those who could otherwise remain at home. Proposed budget changes could slow the growth of Medicaid spending, leading to cuts in enrollment, services, or provider payments.</p>
