        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed. The malfunction missed a clear "out" call on a crucial point, leading the chair umpire to order a replay, which frustrated Pavlyuchenkova who claimed the game was "stolen" from her. Although she ultimately won the match, the incident raised questions about the reliability of the new technology and the umpire's decision not to overrule the system's failure. The All England Club later attributed the issue to operator error.</p>

Local officials confirmed the grim death toll while search efforts continue for missing individuals, including several campers from Camp Mystic.

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS nations issued a joint declaration condemning recent military strikes on Iran, calling for an end to the cycle of violence in the Middle East. The statement, however, pointedly avoided directly blaming the United States or Israel for the attacks, reflecting a cautious diplomatic stance. While the declaration criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory and called for a two-state solution, it fell short of the stronger language Tehran had hoped for. The document highlights the bloc's focus on de-escalation while navigating complex regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) and DW's Director General have strongly condemned an attack on a DW correspondent and cameraman by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The team, who were clearly marked as press, were chased and had stones thrown at them while covering a protest against settler violence; they escaped unharmed, but their vehicle was damaged. The incident, witnessed by several other international news organizations, has prompted calls for the Israeli government to ensure the safety of all journalists and uphold freedom of the press in the region.</p>

          <p>The dire state of Libya's healthcare system is highlighted by the story of a seven-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis whose family undertook a dangerous boat journey to Italy to seek treatment. A photo of the exhausted child on a smuggler's boat went viral, sparking protests in Tripoli over the lack of medication and facilities. Since the 2011 overthrow of Gaddafi, Libya's political chaos has crippled its health services, forcing desperate families to risk their lives at sea.

          <p>Military experts writing in the official PLA Daily have stated that China's military requires significant structural reform to effectively defend against threats from unmanned aircraft. Citing the crucial role of drones in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine, they suggest the People's Liberation Army will likely need to establish specialized counter-drone combat units. In the short term, the focus is expected to be on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing electronic warfare units to address this evolving aspect of modern warfare.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow is releasing a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the complexities and humor of the iconic American author. Chernow discusses how Twain's work remains relevant today, with themes of politics, race, and class that continue to resonate. He traces Twain's sardonic humor to a life marked by both adventure and a fear of poverty, which fueled his pursuit of wealth. The biography delves into how Twain, through masterpieces like "Huckleberry Finn," became a vital voice in American culture.</p>

Responding to White House efforts to defund public media entities like PBS and NPR, Burns argued that such cuts disproportionately harm rural areas where PBS may be the only broadcast signal available. He emphasized that public broadcasting provides essential services beyond entertainment, including children's programming, continuing education, and emergency information. Burns stated that his own extensive historical documentaries would not have been possible without the support of PBS.</p>

          <p>Rick Spinrad, the former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has warned that deep staffing cuts have compromised the United States' ability to predict weather. He stated that many weather forecast offices are now understaffed, putting an extra burden on the remaining scientists and potentially degrading the accuracy of forecasts for events like hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. While he could not directly link the cuts to the recent Texas floods, he argued that without adequate research and staff, the nation's ability to prepare for severe weather is inevitably weakened.</p>

The piece suggests this has profound implications, leading to repressed dissent and militarized responses in liberal societies.
