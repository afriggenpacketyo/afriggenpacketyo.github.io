          <p>A power cut, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting approximately 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas. According to officials, an electricity substation was set on fire and a pylon at another location was damaged, leading to the outage. Despite the disruption, organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to an alternative power supply. The power outage also impacted local shops and restaurants, causing operational difficulties, but electricity was fully restored by late afternoon.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and taking credit for rebuilding the U.S. military.

Trump highlighted the end of critical race theory instruction at military academies and claimed a new record in peacetime recruiting, although military records indicate enlistments began rebounding before his administration. Vice President Vance spoke at the Naval Academy, reinforcing the administration's stance against "forever wars".</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a WWI submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, resulting in the loss of 19 crew members.

The USS F-1 collided with another submarine during training exercises, sinking rapidly. The team also documented a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed nearby in 1950, and a remembrance ceremony was held for the lost crew members.</p>

Fetterman expresses frustration over constant questions about his mental health, saying he is showing up because the media has portrayed his absenteeism as a sign of mental unfitness.

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked global protests, initial hopes for lasting change have largely gone unfulfilled, particularly in the U.S. President Trump has rolled back diversity programs, and police killings continue at alarming rates. Despite some positive changes in dialogue and policy, many believe the country has failed to maintain a proactive interest in equality. While the Black Lives Matter movement raised awareness, the impact on systemic change has been limited, with persistent concerns about police violence and racial inequality.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on whether to renew an arms embargo on South Sudan, with Amnesty International warning that the conflict could worsen without it. The embargo, imposed in 2018, aims to prevent arms transfers to conflict parties but has faced violations. Amnesty International has documented the deployment of armed Ugandan soldiers and equipment in South Sudan, raising concerns about the embargo's effectiveness.
