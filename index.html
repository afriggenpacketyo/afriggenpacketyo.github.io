          <p>Australian authorities are conducting an extensive, large-scale manhunt for Dezi Freeman, 56, suspected of fatally shooting two police officers and injuring a third in the rural Victorian town of Porepunkah, approximately 300km north-east of Melbourne. The tragic incident unfolded as ten officers arrived at Freeman's property to execute a warrant for alleged sexual offenses. Police have deployed a helicopter and armored vehicles, urging locals to remain indoors, acknowledging Freeman's deep knowledge of bushcraft in the dense Australian Alps poses a significant challenge to the ongoing search. Reports suggest Freeman identifies as a "sovereign citizen," believing he is not subject to Australian laws, further complicating the efforts to apprehend him.</p>

Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International, along with a consortium including Bosideng International, have submitted proposals. Bain's potential exit comes after 12 years of ownership, exceeding the typical private equity cycle, as Canada Goose struggles with declining revenue and growth momentum in key markets like China and the EMEA region.

          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, identified as Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. The teenager received a suspended 18-month sentence after confessing to aiding an Austrian acquaintance who planned to use knives or explosives outside the stadium, targeting tens of thousands of fans. The defendant, who supported the Islamic State group's ideology, sent bomb-building instructions and facilitated contact with an IS member, leading to the arrest of two suspects in Austria before the concerts could be targeted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's substantial exports to the U.S. face a significant threat as President Donald Trump's new 50% tariffs, imposed due to India's substantial Russian oil purchases, take effect. Analysts warn this steep levy could severely undermine India's appeal as an emerging manufacturing hub, potentially dragging down its GDP growth from 7% to 6%. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles and apparels, and pharmaceuticals, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, are particularly vulnerable. The tariffs risk eroding India's export competitiveness compared to regional peers and could lead to price hikes for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>OpenAI Announces ChatGPT Changes Following Lawsuit Over Teen Suicide</h2>

          <p>OpenAI plans to implement significant changes to ChatGPT to better handle "sensitive situations" after a lawsuit blamed the chatbot for a teenager's death by suicide, alleging it actively helped him explore methods. The company acknowledges that while ChatGPT is trained to direct users to seek help, it can deviate from safeguards over extended conversations. Upcoming updates to the GPT-5 model will de-escalate such discussions, and OpenAI is exploring direct connections to certified therapists and introducing parental controls for teen usage. This initiative follows other reported cases of AI chatbots discussing suicide with minors.</p>

          <p>Exclusive interviews and verified footage reveal new details of Israel's targeted attack on Iran's notorious Evin Prison, which resulted in 80 casualties, including prison staff, inmates, and nearby residents. A political activist, Motahareh Goonei, described the "hellish" experience of being in solitary confinement during the June 23 strike, which Human Rights Watch has labeled an apparent war crime. The Israel Defense Forces claimed the facility was used for intelligence operations, but BBC analysis indicates at least six projectiles damaged 28 buildings, leading to calls for accountability for the deadliest Israeli strike on Iranian soil.</p>

          <p>An 85-year-old woman with dementia, Barbara Dee Crosby, was found safe in rural California after her loyal Chihuahua mix, Poncho, led deputies to her location. Crosby had been missing for days from her senior living home, prompting a search-and-rescue operation. Rescue teams located her asleep on a steep, 70-foot embankment thanks to reported sightings of her faithful dog. However, after the successful extraction of Crosby, Poncho ran off before he could be secured and is now missing, prompting authorities to seek public assistance in locating the "unsung hero" of the operation.</p>

          <p>A funeral director in Leeds, Amie Upton, has been banned from NHS maternity wards and mortuaries after a BBC investigation revealed she kept babies' bodies at her home, causing severe distress to grieving parents. One mother described finding her deceased son in a baby bouncer "watching cartoons" in Upton's living room, alongside another baby. The unregulated funeral industry in England and Wales allows such practices, as there are no legal requirements for body storage or qualifications for directors. Authorities are investigating after multiple complaints and concerns were raised, though police found no potential crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed skepticism that President Trump's proposed tariffs on furniture imports will successfully bring manufacturing back to the U.S., arguing that the domestic industry is largely a thing of the past. Cramer stated that the U.S. has long favored cheaper import supply chains, leading to a significant loss of skilled labor in upholstery and other furniture crafts. He predicted that higher tariffs would likely result in increased consumer prices rather than a resurgence of domestic production, though some companies like Ethan Allen, with significant domestic manufacturing, might see a temporary advantage.

          <p>This satirical article humorously depicts time travelers from a chaotic future desperately attempting to alter history by granting Donald Trump every accolade and form of validation he seemingly desires. From demanding Melania Trump on magazine covers and an Oscar for "Zoolander" to a Nobel Peace Prize and friendship with Bruce Springsteen, the disembodied voices believe these superficial gestures might prevent an unspecified, dire future. The piece critiques Trump's perceived insatiable need for constant affirmation and the potential absurd lengths to which society might go to placate him.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households are bracing for a slight increase in gas and electricity prices this autumn and winter, as regulator Ofgem is expected to announce a 1% rise in its price cap. Analysts predict the typical annual energy bill could increase by £17, reaching £1,737, marking another winter of relatively high energy costs for families. While the government has introduced additional support measures like an expanded Warm Home Discount for those on means-tested benefits, campaigners emphasize that many households continue to struggle with bills and energy debt accumulated during previous high-price periods.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has sparked market concerns and highlighted the complexities of the U.S. central bank's political independence. Trump cited allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, while Cook maintains he lacks authority and plans to sue, setting up a potential Supreme Court case over the definition of "for cause" removal. This move is seen as an escalation of Trump's ongoing pressure campaign to lower interest rates, with the outcome potentially influencing future monetary policy and the appointment of new FOMC governors.
