          <p>A tragic collision between a sailboat and a barge off Miami Beach has resulted in the deaths of two children, a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl. The children were part of a summer sailing program hosted by the Miami Yacht Club when the incident occurred, sinking the sailboat and throwing all six occupants into the water. Two other children remain in critical condition, while a fifth child and an adult counselor were rescued without needing hospitalization. The U.S. Coast Guard has established a safety zone and is conducting an ongoing investigation into the fatal crash.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the European Union have brokered a new trade deal, narrowly avoiding a threatened escalation in tariffs by the Trump administration. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on many EU imports, a reduction from the proposed 30%, and includes commitments for tariff-free trade on specific goods like aircraft. Additionally, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years, although some details, such as potential exemptions for European wine, are still under negotiation. The legality of the tariffs remains under scrutiny, with a case heading to an appeals court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, has left three people dead and three others injured. Authorities report that a lone gunman opened fire in the valet area and parking lot, shooting multiple victims seemingly at random before being engaged by a security guard and responding police officers. The suspect was shot by police and is hospitalized in critical condition, with no known connection established between him and the victims. The Sparks Police Department is leading the investigation due to the involvement of Reno police officers in the final exchange of gunfire.</p>

The most extreme conditions are concentrated in the Southeast, where heat indices, factoring in humidity, are projected to reach as high as 120 degrees in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Major cities from the Midwest to the Northeast, including New York and Boston, are also experiencing feels-like temperatures soaring above 100 degrees. The prolonged heat poses a life-threatening risk, with little relief expected even at night, as smoke from Canadian wildfires exacerbates air quality issues in some regions.</p>

          <h2>Israeli Officials Contest Trump's Assessment, Calling Images of Gaza Starvation 'Fake'</h2>

          <p>The Israeli government is defending a military official who dismissed images of starving Palestinians in Gaza as "fake," creating a public disagreement with President Trump, who stated he believes the images are real. The dispute arises amid growing international condemnation of the humanitarian crisis, with two Israeli human rights groups now labeling the situation a genocide. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that "there is no starvation in Gaza," attributing aid distribution problems to the UN and claiming Hamas diverts supplies. This starkly contrasts with assessments from the UN and aid agencies, which report rising deaths from malnutrition, especially among children.</p>

          <p>An inquest has heard that a 23-year-old Cambridge graduate with non-Hodgkin lymphoma died after refusing chemotherapy, having told a court she was "anti-vax." Paloma Shemirani, whose mother is a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, opted for an alternative Gerson therapy, which involves a strict diet and enemas but has no scientific evidence of effectiveness. She had denied the cancer diagnosis, feared infertility from chemotherapy, and described NHS practitioners' actions as a violation of her human rights. The young woman suffered a fatal heart attack caused by her tumor, and the inquest is examining the appropriateness of her care.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the first of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is currently located hundreds of miles south-southeast of Honolulu, Hawaii, and does not pose an immediate threat to the islands. Forecasters expect Iona to strengthen further into a Category 2 hurricane as it moves westward over the next couple of days before gradually weakening later in the week.

          <p>China's aviation regulator is reportedly surveying its national airlines about their future fleet requirements, specifically asking about potential orders for Boeing aircraft. This move suggests that aircraft purchases could become a key area of cooperation if broader trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington prove successful. The director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China recently met with a senior Boeing executive to discuss expanding their partnership. While Boeing has often been caught in the middle of U.S.-China trade tensions, industry insiders believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from any diplomatic thaw between the two global powers.

          <p>Lakers superstar Luka Dončić has undergone a significant physical transformation, detailed in a new "Men's Health" feature that showcases a slimmer, more toned physique. Dončić committed to an intense offseason program in his home country of Croatia, involving twice-daily workouts and a strict gluten-free, low-sugar, high-protein diet. This renewed focus on conditioning comes after reports of frustration within his former team, the Mavericks, regarding his discipline. Dončić stated that this summer marks a "huge step" in his commitment to his health and performance, and he intends to maintain this new lifestyle throughout the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian family seeking the UK government's help to escape Gaza has won a significant High Court ruling. The court ordered the foreign secretary to reconsider the decision not to assist the family, who have a British relative and were granted permission to come to the UK but are unable to leave Gaza. The family is living in a tent in Deir al-Balah at "constant risk of injury or death." The Foreign Office had previously refused to intervene, citing a restrictive policy, but the judge found the family's situation to be legally exceptional and worthy of reassessment, a decision praised by the family's lawyer.</p>

The agreement, which imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., was widely seen as a necessary compromise to avert a more damaging trade war. Despite the downbeat reactions, most EU members acknowledged it was the best outcome achievable under the difficult circumstances created by the Trump administration's protectionist stance.

Economists from Société Générale described it as an "unbalanced deal" where the EU conceded to avoid escalating a trade war. The pact is expected to reduce the EU's annual GDP, though it does provide some market certainty by heading off the threatened 30% tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's assertion of "irrefutable evidence" of an Obama-era plot is framed as a desperate move to shift public focus. The article contends that the conclusion of Russian interference to help Trump in 2016 is well-supported by public evidence and a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report. This strategy of "promiscuous dissembling" aims to change the subject while simultaneously reinforcing a revisionist history of the 2016 election.</p>
