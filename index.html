          <p>Former President Donald Trump is reportedly considering selling his red Tesla, acquired in March, following a public fallout with Elon Musk. Trump initially purchased the electric vehicle to demonstrate his support for Tesla and Musk, who faced criticism for his involvement in the Trump administration's efforts to cut government spending. The decision to potentially part ways with the Tesla comes after a series of attacks on Tesla vehicles and locations linked to the company. The relationship between Trump and Musk has deteriorated, leading to Trump's consideration of selling or even giving away the vehicle.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a surge in measles cases, with confirmed cases nearing a 30-year high, having quadrupled compared to the previous year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 1,168 cases have been reported across 33 states, with the majority occurring among individuals who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Tragically, at least two school-aged children have died from the disease, both of whom were unvaccinated and had no underlying health conditions. The rise in measles cases underscores the importance of vaccination efforts to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army's Caisson Detachment, responsible for horse-drawn funerals at Arlington National Cemetery, has resumed its duties after a two-year hiatus and a $28 million overhaul. The program was suspended in May 2023 following the deaths of several horses due to poor living conditions and neglect. An Army investigation revealed inadequate stables, low-quality feed, and a lack of expertise in horse care, leading to the complete renovation of the unit. The Army has implemented better training, improved living conditions, and brought in equine experts to ensure the well-being of the horses.</p>

The driver, identified as Azmir Djurkovic, later admitted to speeding and failing to stop because he was running late for his interview.

The GHF, a relatively new organization, lacks a realistic plan for the "last mile" of aid delivery and has faced challenges in ensuring the safety and dignity of those receiving assistance.

          <p>Annuities can provide predictable income during retirement by converting a lump sum into guaranteed monthly payments, with payouts varying based on factors like age, gender, and investment amount. A single-life immediate fixed annuity provides payments that start immediately and continue for the rest of your life, with older buyers receiving larger monthly payments due to a shorter anticipated payout period. Men generally receive higher monthly payouts than women because of their shorter life expectancy, and adding features like joint-life annuities or inflation protection can also affect the monthly payout. While annuities are not suitable for everyone, they can be a valuable tool for those seeking guaranteed income and peace of mind in retirement (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Alex Warren's hit song "Ordinary" has achieved its 12th week at number one in the UK, marking the longest chart reign since Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" in 2017. The song, written for Warren's wife, has garnered over 107 million streams in the UK and has surpassed Slim Whitman's record for the most consecutive weeks at number one by a US artist. James Masterton notes the song's crossover appeal and its popularity as a wedding song, comparing it to other long-running romantic tracks. Despite its success, the fragmented media landscape means the song has not achieved the same level of ubiquity as past chart-toppers.</p>

          <p>The public falling-out between former President Trump and Elon Musk has highlighted a divide within the conservative movement regarding fiscal policy and the role of government. Musk's opposition to Trump's "big, beautiful bill" stems from its potential to increase the national deficit, contrasting with his previous role in cutting government spending. This conflict has exposed a fault line between traditional conservatives who prioritize fiscal responsibility and nationalist conservatives who favor displays of state power. The feud could impact Trump's ability to pass his legislative agenda and may lead to a shift in political alliances.</p>

          <p>An auditors' report has revealed a "pervasive fraud environment" at Unite, one of the UK's largest trade unions. The report, commissioned by Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham, also highlighted a Â£53.8m financial hit related to a hotel project in Birmingham. Auditors BDO stated that "dominant personalities and a weak control environment facilitated opportunities to commit fraud" during the 2021 financial year. The report cited "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers, along with a culture that failed to challenge financial transactions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to overturn a court order that would reinstate Department of Education employees who were terminated as part of the administration's efforts to dismantle the agency. The administration argues that a U.S. District Judge in Boston lacked the authority to require the Education Department to rehire the workers, with more than 1,300 employees being affected by the mass layoffs in March. A federal appeals court had previously declined to lift the judge's ruling, which pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of civil rights enforcement offices and the elimination of the FAFSA supervision team.</p>
