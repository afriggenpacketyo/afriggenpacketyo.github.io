          <p>The Parliament of England and Wales is set to debate the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would allow some terminally ill adults the choice to end their lives, after undergoing significant changes. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny and revisions, including the removal of the High Court judge requirement, replacing it with a panel of experts. The government also quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year. This debate marks a critical juncture in the ongoing discussion surrounding end-of-life care and individual autonomy, with strong opinions from both sides of the political spectrum, where MPs have been given a free vote on the matter. The bill previously cleared its first hurdle by a vote of 330 to 275 back in November.</p>

          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's decision to manufacture most of its products in China has created a significant vulnerability for the United States. The article highlights how Apple has trained millions of Chinese workers, transferring technology and know-how, enabling China to advance its own tech industry. McGee argues that China wouldn't be where it is today without Apple's investment and training, which has inadvertently aided the rise of Chinese tech companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. The review notes that while the book is comprehensive, it sometimes delves into excessive detail, yet it persuasively exposes the intertwined relationship between Apple and China, suggesting the exploitation goes both ways.</p>

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its jewelry division, as wealthy consumers continue to spend despite global economic uncertainties. The group's Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, experienced double-digit growth. However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China. While Richemont faces headwinds such as rising gold prices and currency fluctuations, analysts believe the company's pricing power could offset some of these challenges.</p>

This event has sparked discussions about the potential expansion of air-to-air missile exports as Beijing challenges Western dominance.

The company is rolling out the meditation feature, aimed at improving sleep quality, which will be triggered during "sleep hours" and turned on by default for users under 18. This initiative comes amid public pressure and lawsuits concerning the platform's impact on young users, with attorneys general alleging TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to kids.

          <p>Legendary Motown singer Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department following allegations of sexual assault dating back to 2014. The accusations stem from a civil suit filed by four former housekeepers, who are seeking $50 million in damages for sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and creating a hostile work environment. Robinson's attorney denies the allegations, claiming the accusers filed their police report only after the civil suit was filed to publicize their case. The women claim they did not come forward earlier because of their immigration status.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study reveals that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines. The study confirms human migration from northern Asia to South America occurred at least 23,000 years ago.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with a 0.2% decrease compared to the previous quarter, largely due to a fall in exports. The decline was more significant than expected, with a 0.7% contraction compared to the same quarter in the previous year. Uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's trade policies have negatively impacted Japan's export-heavy economy. Despite these challenges, domestic demand has shown strength, contributing positively to the GDP, but analysts warn that the Trump tariffs could further exacerbate the economic slowdown.</p>

Simion, a self-described Trumpist, secured 41% of the vote in the first round of elections, fueled by decades of economic failure and anti-establishment anger. The author argues that neither Simion nor his opponent, Nicusor Dan, offer a genuine alternative to the country's broken economic model, which has led to widespread poverty and emigration.

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets following President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors diversifying away from the U.S. due to tariff shocks. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, potentially impacting the future appeal of Japanese assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pregnant woman in Georgia, declared brain dead after a medical emergency, has been kept on life support for three months to allow the fetus to develop, a decision her family says was dictated by the state's abortion ban. Doctors at Emory University Hospital cited the law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected, as the reason they cannot remove life-saving devices, despite the woman being legally dead. The family is upset that they do not have a say in the matter, and doctors have expressed concerns about the fetus' health. The situation highlights the complex legal and ethical questions surrounding abortion bans and end-of-life decisions.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea after the virus was found in two healthy children during routine screening. Less than half of the country's population is immunized against the disease, prompting calls for an immediate vaccination campaign targeting children aged 10 and below. The WHO, UNICEF, and the Australian government are supporting Papua New Guinea in its efforts to achieve 100% polio immunization by the end of the year. The outbreak is linked to a virus strain circulating in Indonesia, highlighting the need for regional cooperation to combat the disease.</p>

However, Tice acknowledged that Dubai is not "perfect," citing its absolute monarchy and poor ranking for civil liberties, but he argued that current British values are "not working" due to high crime rates and issues with the justice system.</p>

The "active cyberdefense" law requires operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches to the government. This move reflects Japan's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations.

          <p>Japan's economy contracted for the first time in a year, shrinking by 0.2% in the March quarter due to declining exports. Uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies have affected Japan's export-heavy economy, though domestic demand showed some strength. While Japan is engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S., the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has warned that U.S. tariff policy will exert downward pressure on economic activity and prices. Despite growth concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate, aiming to achieve its 2% inflation target.</p>
