          <p>Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second U.S. Open championship, overcoming defending champion Jannik Sinner in a four-set final. This victory marks Alcaraz's sixth major trophy and his second Grand Slam win of 2025, following his French Open triumph against Sinner. The match, delayed by enhanced security for President Trump's attendance, saw Alcaraz dominate, dropping only one set throughout the entire tournament. This historic final was the third consecutive Grand Slam meeting between the two rivals, solidifying their emerging rivalry in tennis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study by Chinese and U.S. scientists, utilizing seismic data from NASA’s InSight lander, discovered that Mars has a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This finding challenges previous assumptions, as Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core. The presence of a solid inner core, a feature shared with Earth and the Moon, could reignite discussions about whether Earth was once unique in developing plate tectonics. This significant geological discovery sheds new light on planetary evolution.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose, with Japan's Nikkei 225 jumping 1.5% and the Topix reaching a record high, after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. Investors are now eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with Takaichi's pro-deregulation stance seen as a potential growth driver. The Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields increased amid persistent inflation and tighter monetary policy expectations. Meanwhile, OPEC+ agreed to a slower oil production increase, and U.S. stock futures were flat ahead of key inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article critically examines Rahm Emanuel's suggestion that China could serve as an external threat to restore American political cohesion. The author refutes the idea of China as an inherent enemy, challenging Emanuel's claims that China views America as a strategic adversary due to perceived U.S. decline and internal divisions. The article argues that blaming China for America's internal political choices, such as electing President Trump, is misplaced. It posits that this perspective overlooks the complex economic realities and internal dynamics shaping U.S.-China relations.</p>

          <p>John Burton, a prominent and outspoken liberal California Democrat, former U.S. congressman, and mentor to many politicians including Nancy Pelosi, has died at 92. Burton was celebrated as a fierce advocate for the working class, foster children, and the environment. Governor Gavin Newsom praised him as a "towering figure" whose decades of service shaped California politics. Despite stepping down in 1982 to address a cocaine addiction, Burton returned to politics and later founded a nonprofit for foster youth, leaving a lasting legacy of fighting for the underdog.</p>

          <p>Customs officials in Nigeria recently seized over 1,600 parrots and canaries being illegally transported from Lagos to Kuwait without proper permits.

Animal smuggling poses significant threats, endangering species, disrupting ecosystems, and potentially affecting human food supplies. Efforts to combat this problem include strengthening laws, ensuring enforcement resources, and electing officials who prioritize conservation.</p>

          <p>President Trump clarified his recent "Department of WAR" social media post regarding Chicago, stating he does not intend to "go to war" but rather to "clean up" American cities. This follows his suggestions of deploying National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans to combat crime or assist with deportations. Illinois' governor and Chicago's mayor criticized his initial threats, calling them dictatorial. Legal challenges have also emerged, with a federal judge ruling Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles as illegal. Opponents of the plan held protests in Chicago.</p>

          <p>Florida's controversial plan to eliminate some school vaccine mandates, making them voluntary for illnesses like chickenpox and hepatitis B, will not take effect for approximately 90 days. This move, advocated by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, marks a significant departure from established public health policy and has drawn widespread criticism from health experts and lawmakers. While other mandates for diseases like measles and polio remain, the proposal raises concerns about declining immunization rates and potential outbreaks. Ladapo's past controversial statements and altered data on vaccine risks have further fueled the debate.</p>

Despite an early German lead, Northern Ireland managed to equalize through Isaac Price's volley, demonstrating a strong fight. However, two quick goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz secured Germany's victory. O'Neill lamented some defensive errors and questioned a free-kick decision, acknowledging his squad's lack of depth for back-to-back away games.

While the administration is preparing backup plans, including using other legal authorities for tariffs, the outcome remains uncertain, posing a substantial financial and legal challenge.

          <p>California Republicans found rare unity and energy at their fall convention, galvanized by their opposition to Proposition 50, Governor Gavin Newsom's ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. Republicans view this measure as a Democratic attempt to "rig" the 2026 election, potentially costing them five U.S. House seats and control of Congress. With over $40 million already spent on campaigns for and against, the party sees defeating Proposition 50 as crucial for its survival. Gubernatorial candidates are also prioritizing this issue, urging activists to mobilize against what they perceive as a power grab.</p>
