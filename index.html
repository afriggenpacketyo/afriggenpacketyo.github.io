          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 13:31:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Buss family has reached an agreement to sell a majority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers to businessman Mark Walter, valuing the team at $10 billion, setting a new NBA record. Jeanie Buss will retain a minority stake and her governor seat, while Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners and owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, WNBA's Sparks, and Cadillac's Formula 1 team, expands his sports ownership portfolio. Former Lakers legend Magic Johnson praised the transaction, highlighting Walter's suitability to carry on the Lakers' legacy. NBA valuations have significantly increased since the league's recent media rights agreement, with the Lakers finishing the 2025 season as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference after acquiring Luka Doncic in February. The Lakers have secured 11 NBA titles since the Buss family's acquisition, solidifying their dynasty. Optimism is in the air regarding the new ownership and the team's future. The optimism score is based on the stability of the Lakers brand being in the hands of someone who already owns numerous sports teams.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are calling Israel's military campaign in Iran a "resounding military win," citing years of preparation, battlefield innovation, and intelligence development that have allowed Israel to dominate the Iranian military. Despite Iranian retaliation, which included a missile strike on an Israeli hospital, analysts insist that the IDF maintains a tactical and strategic advantage, drawing comparisons to the Six-Day War. Strategists highlight the importance of rapidly neutralizing rocket launchers, a doctrine refined in Gaza and now adapted to Iran. While Iran's nuclear infrastructure has been significantly damaged, the Fordow nuclear enrichment facility remains a key target, with experts suggesting the U.S. should ensure its dismantling through diplomatic or military means. The optimism score is based on the fact that Iran's ability to threaten Israel has been greatly diminished.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tariffs are driving up the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, leading homeowners to reconsider their plans. Suppliers of lumber, steel, and aluminum have already increased prices for builders, resulting in typical price increases of around $10,000 per project. Builders recommend pre-ordering materials to lock in prices before further increases and suggest homeowners consider alternatives like fresh paint instead of new appliances. They also advise budgeting an additional 30% for tariff-related costs, especially for bathroom remodels, and prioritizing exterior repairs to prevent further degradation. The optimism score is based on the fact that there are still ways to save money on remodeling projects.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for a further 90 days. The video-sharing app has faced questions over its future after the US passed a law last year requiring the app to be banned unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Lawmakers said it posed a risk to national security - something TikTok denies. The optimism score is based on the fact that TikTok remains available in the US.</p>

          <h2>Thai Town Loves Strawberry Fanta</h2>

          <p>Thai Town loves strawberry Fanta because it is offered at spirit houses. In Thai culture, ghosts, broadly referred to as phi (à¸œà¸µ) are commonly believed in and tended to. Much like those on this earthly plane, the way to a spiritâ€™s heart is through his or her stomach. The list of snack and drink offerings found at spirit houses is almost as long as the list of spirits themselves. The optimism score is based on the fact that people are taking care of spirits.</p>

          <h2>Government to Explore Social Media Measures</h2>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer says the government will explore whether further protective measures can be put in place on social media platforms after tennis player Katie Boulter highlighted the sickening abuse she received. Several England players say they plan to give up social media for their upcoming European Championship defence in Switzerland. Speaking to the BBC's Katie Gornall as he met the Lionesses at St George's Park on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Starmer said it was not right for female athletes to "adjust their own lives" because of such abuse. The optimism score is based on the fact that the government is going to explore social media measures.</p>
