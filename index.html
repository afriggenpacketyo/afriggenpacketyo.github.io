          <p>A significant fire erupted at a Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, California, one of the largest on the U.S. West Coast. The blaze, which followed reports of an explosion, prompted an active response from Chevron's fire department and local emergency services. The company confirmed that all personnel and contractors were accounted for, with no injuries sustained. Officials have not issued any evacuation orders for nearby residents, and air quality monitoring systems have not detected any dangerous emissions.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terror attack outside a Manchester synagogue, UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressed disappointment that pro-Palestinian demonstrations proceeded. She described the continuation of such protests as "un-British" and urged organizers to reconsider future marches, citing the need for sensitivity after the loss of life. The UK's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, echoed these concerns, linking the rhetoric at some demonstrations to the rise in antisemitism that he believes culminated in the attack. This highlights the tension between freedom of protest and public safety in a charged political climate.</p>

India's largest airline, IndiGo, announced it will restart services between Kolkata and Guangzhou in late October, with plans for additional routes. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated the resumption is expected to enhance people-to-people exchanges and support a gradual normalization of ties. This development marks a significant step after air travel was suspended amid border tensions and the global pandemic.</p>

          <p>Police have identified Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, as the two men killed in a terror attack outside a synagogue in Manchester during Yom Kippur. The attacker, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car and a knife before being shot and killed by police. Britain's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, described the assault as a result of an "unrelenting wave of Jew hatred," highlighting a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents in the UK. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities probing the attacker's motives and potential accomplices.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has been named by President Trump as a key figure in a proposed "Board of Peace" for post-war Gaza. Blair, known for his role in the Good Friday Agreement, has called Trump's plan "bold and intelligent." However, his involvement has drawn significant criticism due to his controversial legacy from the 2003 Iraq invasion, with some Palestinian figures and international observers expressing strong skepticism. The plan's reception is mixed, reflecting Blair's polarizing reputation and the complexities of achieving peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Following the elimination of federal funding for public media, local stations across the U.S., like South Dakota Public Broadcasting, are facing severe budget cuts. The network has been forced to slash its newsroom staff and cancel its signature daily public affairs show, "In the Moment." To survive, it is prioritizing more popular and potentially self-sustaining content like high school sports coverage, while relying more on national programming from NPR and PBS.

          <p>U.S. Men's National Team manager Mauricio Pochettino has defended his unconventional approach of not explaining to players why they were left off the roster. He argues that players should intrinsically understand their performance and that providing justifications can be counterproductive. This philosophy is part of his effort to change the team's culture, ensuring no player feels entitled to a spot on the World Cup squad based on past achievements. His recent roster for friendlies against Ecuador and Australia reflects this strategy, with several notable players returning while others were omitted without public explanation.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning that the potential U.S. supply of long-range missiles, such as Tomahawks, to Ukraine would represent a "completely new stage of escalation." Speaking at a forum, Putin stated that using such weapons would be impossible without direct U.S. military involvement. His comments follow reports that the Trump administration is considering sending the advanced cruise missiles and has approved sharing intelligence for targeting deep inside Russia. This development signals a potential major shift in the conflict and heightens tensions between Moscow and Washington.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether the Nobel Prizes, first awarded in 1901, remain relevant in the contemporary scientific landscape. While the prizes successfully popularize major scientific breakthroughs, they face criticism for promoting a "genius scientist" myth that overlooks the collaborative nature of modern research. The piece also highlights the historical lack of diversity, with laureates overwhelmingly being male and from Western institutions. Despite these shortcomings, the Nobels continue to capture public imagination and serve as a significant milestone for recognizing discoveries that have benefited humanity.</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released an updated report promoting a "planetary health diet" rich in plants, nuts, and whole grains, with less meat and sugar, to benefit both human health and the environment. The report suggests this shift could prevent millions of deaths and cut food-system emissions by over half. However, researchers anticipate a renewed wave of online misinformation, similar to the coordinated campaign that targeted the original 2019 report. A new investigation reveals how industry-linked influencers work to discredit the findings, portraying them as dangerous and elitist to protect meat and dairy industry interests.</p>

          <p>An annual report on German unity highlights that significant disparities remain between the former East and West Germany, 35 years after reunification. While younger generations have grown up in a single nation, those in the east still face lower incomes, less inherited wealth, and poorer public infrastructure in rural areas. This has fostered a distinct "East German" identity that is less common in the west. The report suggests that despite economic growth in the east, closing the gap remains a major challenge, with wealth inequality being a particularly difficult problem to solve.</p>
