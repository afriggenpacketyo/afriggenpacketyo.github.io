          <p>President Trump is holding a crucial meeting with top congressional leaders in a last-ditch effort to prevent a government shutdown, with a deadline just one day away. Democrats are demanding significant healthcare concessions, including reversing Medicaid cuts and extending Obamacare subsidies, while the White House insists on a "clean" short-term funding bill. A stalemate persists, making a shutdown seem increasingly likely as both sides dig in on their positions.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the Democratic strategy concerning a potential government shutdown, facing President Trump's threat to make federal worker furloughs permanent and reorient agencies. While some initially feared a shutdown would empower conservative efforts to dismantle the administrative state, Democrats are now holding firm on healthcare demands. The piece explores whether Trump's threats are a bluff, considering legal limitations and political backlash, but acknowledges the high-stakes gamble.</p>

Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned the firings, asserting they aim to silence critics of the administration's actions on civil rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated threats to impose a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States, aiming to bring movie production back to Hollywood. The article explores the industry's shift overseas due to tax benefits and lower labor costs, and the complex challenges of implementing such tariffs on services rather than goods.

          <p>A Florida man, Craig Vogt, 61, has been charged with aggravated animal cruelty after allegedly killing, cooking, and eating two of his pet peacocks. Authorities state Vogt committed the act out of spite for a neighbor who continued to feed his birds, even sending a letter threatening further harm if the feeding persisted. He reportedly admitted to the act, and during his arrest, threatened to kill his remaining peacocks to prevent their seizure.</p>

          <h2>Golf Legend Tom Watson Expresses Shame Over U.S. Ryder Cup Fan Behavior</h2>

          <p>American golf legend Tom Watson publicly apologized for and expressed "shame" over the "rude and mean-spirited behavior" of U.S. spectators at the Ryder Cup. His comments followed reports of abusive conduct towards European players and their families, including Rory McIlroy's wife being hit by a beer. Watson's strong condemnation stands in contrast to the less critical stance of the American captain, highlighting a divide in acknowledging the severity of the crowd's actions.</p>
