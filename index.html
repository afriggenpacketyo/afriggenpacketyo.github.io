          <p>An Israeli military strike on a school in Gaza, which was housing displaced Palestinians, has resulted in dozens of deaths, according to local medics. The Israeli military stated that it was targeting Hamas militants operating within a command center embedded in the school area and that steps were taken to minimize harm to civilians. This incident has sparked international outrage, particularly after a doctor couple in Gaza lost nine of their ten children in a separate Israeli missile strike. Spain has called for allies to halt arm supplies to Israel for use in Gaza, citing the increasing civilian casualties.</p>

          <p>A new book, *The Age of Diagnosis: How Our Obsession With Medical Labels Is Making Us Sicker*, argues that doctors are too quick to diagnose patients with medical problems, leading to potential harm. The author advocates for ‚Äúslow medicine,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of building doctor-patient relationships, monitoring symptoms, and exercising caution before labeling a condition. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatments and increased anxiety, so a measured approach is essential. While slowing down could risk missing aggressive diseases, the book suggests that doctors often err too far toward overdiagnosis.</p>

          <p>A Colorado Rockies fan, Timothy Roeckel, is suing the MLB team, claiming he sustained serious injuries after being struck by a foul ball at a game in July 2023. Roeckel alleges that a stadium design flaw and inadequate netting contributed to the incident, causing "catastrophic and permanent injuries" to his face and at least one eye. The lawsuit also claims that the Rockies' poor performance contributes to a less engaged game-day environment, making spectators more vulnerable. The Rockies have the worst record in MLB and are on pace to break the record for most losses in a season.</p>

          <p>The Army's horse-drawn caisson funerals are set to resume at Arlington National Cemetery on June 2 after a two-year pause due to horse deaths and outdated facilities.

The caisson detachment passed a major test in January by carrying former President Jimmy Carter's casket. Army officials believe they can conduct two caisson funerals per day with the trained soldiers and horses, offering a solemn tribute to fallen troops and Medal of Honor recipients.</p>

          <p>The U.S. battery industry, crucial for meeting rising energy demand, faces potential setbacks from President Trump's tariffs on China and a Republican tax bill. These measures could increase battery costs and restrict access to subsidies for battery production and installation. The tariffs have already caused sharp increases in battery costs, leading companies to halt imports from China. If the Republican budget bill takes effect, it could severely limit tax credits for battery manufacturing and installation, potentially harming the industry's growth.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) were popular over a century ago, but lost ground to gasoline cars due to cost and convenience. Now, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are working to undercut the growth of EVs, imposing new taxes and favoring oil and gasoline. This mirrors the early 1900s, when political and economic factors undermined EVs. Concerns about charging and access to fuel were also prevalent in both eras. While EV sales are growing globally, the U.S. market faces challenges, raising concerns about a repeat of history.</p>
