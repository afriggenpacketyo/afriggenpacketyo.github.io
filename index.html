          <p>An investigation in China's Gansu province revealed that the provincial disease control agency and a local hospital deliberately faked lead poisoning test results for kindergarten children. Ten officials, including high-ranking health commission and municipal leaders, are now under investigation for these oversight failures. The provincial government has issued a sincere apology to the affected families and has committed to providing free medical treatment and reimbursement for all related costs. This scandal has drawn national attention and highlighted severe integrity issues within public health institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While few companies openly attribute job cuts to artificial intelligence, employment experts suspect AI is a significant, unstated factor behind recent layoffs. Firms often use vague terms like "restructuring" or "optimization" to avoid public and employee backlash, even when their financial performance is strong. This strategic silence allows companies to reshape their workforce by replacing roles in customer service, HR, and content with AI tools. Experts note that while AI is transforming industries, companies may be overestimating its current capabilities, potentially leading to future operational challenges.</p>

          <p>An 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, who had been granted political asylum in the U.S. in 1987, was secretly deported to Guatemala after visiting an immigration office to replace his lost green card. His family was initially unable to locate him and was later falsely told he had died, before discovering he was hospitalized in Guatemala, a country to which he has no ties. The man, Luis Leon, had lived in the U.S. for nearly 40 years, raising a family and working until retirement. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has stated it is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Obama, offers a perspective on bridging political divides in his new book. He argues that instead of searching for elusive "common ground," people should focus on finding "neutral ground"—shared activities or interests that allow for connection without focusing on disagreements. Drawing from his experience surfing with his politically different brother-in-law, Litt suggests that these shared, non-political spaces can foster friendships and lead to more genuine discussions. This approach, he believes, is essential for navigating an increasingly polarized society.</p>

          <p>Exit polls from Japan's upper house election indicate that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition is set to lose its legislative majority, a significant political blow. Public frustration over rising prices, political scandals, and trade pressures contributed to the poor showing for the Liberal Democratic Party and its partner, Komeito. Despite the defeat, which has historically led to resignations, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to handle critical trade negotiations with the United States. The election also saw a surge for the right-wing populist Sanseito party, adding a new dynamic to Japan's political landscape.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection. This involves the ability to recognize and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parental responses, like dismissing a child's fears or upsets, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. To foster self-connection, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of their child's personality, and model their own emotional awareness.</p>

The rise of the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, the gig economy, and remote work creating time for side hustles means that "jobs" are a poor metric for economic health. The author suggests that a more accurate measure would be to track income levels, analyzing how many working-age Americans earn above a certain threshold from all sources.

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, has doubled down on his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the late accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While advocating for transparency, he cautioned against exposing the identities of victims or other innocent individuals who may be named in the files. He pushed back against criticism from President Trump, who called Republicans demanding the release "foolish," but noted Trump's subsequent directive to the Attorney General to move to unseal the evidence was "a start." Burchett expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Personalities Can Be Intentionally Redesigned Through Behavioral Changes</h2>

          <p>Scientific research suggests that personality traits are not fixed and can be intentionally changed over time. Writer Olga Khazan, who documented her own journey of personality redesign in her book "Me, But Better," successfully tackled her anxiety and introversion by forcing herself into uncomfortable situations like improv classes. Psychologists explain that by consciously adopting new behaviors and maintaining them, individuals can shift their characteristic ways of thinking and feeling. This approach involves identifying desired traits and then actively practicing the behaviors associated with them for personal growth.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, identifies a lack of preparation as the biggest red flag in a job interview. She states that it is crucial for candidates to do their due diligence and demonstrate a solid understanding of the company and the role they are applying for. Conversely, Johnson is most impressed when a candidate can offer genuine, thoughtful feedback on the business, showing they have critically engaged with the company's work. She also values candidates who can honestly discuss past mistakes and what they learned, as it shows resilience and self-awareness.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for reinstating the Confederate names of several U.S. Army bases, an action that appears to flout a 2021 federal law. To circumvent the law, which mandated new names, the Pentagon claims the bases are now named after different historical soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. Critics, including some Republicans, have called this a transparent game and an insult, as the original names honored figures who fought against the United States to preserve slavery. The House Armed Services Committee has voted to block Hegseth's move.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir and interview, Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her trailblazing career and the state of American politics. She recounts facing both racism and sexism, including a notable incident with Senator Jesse Helms, and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its response to Donald Trump. Despite recent backsliding on civil rights, she remains optimistic that Americans ultimately value democracy and will resist authoritarianism.</p>

          <h2>Essay Explores Oklahoma's Contradictory History as a Microcosm of the American Experience</h2>

          <p>This long-form essay explores the complex and often contradictory history of Oklahoma as a key to understanding the United States as a whole. The author reflects on growing up with sanitized historical narratives, such as re-enacting land runs that ignore the violent dispossession of Indigenous nations. The piece delves into the state's foundational legacy of land theft and racial terror, alongside ambitious attempts to create havens, like the all-Black towns envisioned by figures such as Edward McCabe. It argues that Oklahoma's cycle of reinvention and erasure reflects America's larger struggle with its own identity, ambition, and unresolved historical injustices.</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows Declining Support for Trump's Deportation Program as Public Focus Remains on Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. This shift corresponds with a perception that the program is not prioritizing dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected, with Hispanic Americans feeling unfairly targeted. The poll also reveals that most Americans, particularly those outside the president's base, believe the administration should focus more on lowering prices and inflation. Overall approval for the president has continued to slide, despite his base remaining strongly supportive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study analyzing census data shows that retirees are moving out of major U.S. cities, with New York City experiencing the largest net loss of residents aged 60 and over. Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and several other California cities also saw significant outflows of seniors in 2023. A high cost of living appears to be a major contributing factor, as many of the cities are in states where over $1 million in savings is recommended for a comfortable retirement. While reasons for moving vary, the trend highlights the financial pressures forcing retirees to seek more affordable locations.</p>

Seven victims are in critical condition, and the driver faces potential charges of attempted murder. The incident caused a chaotic scene, with a taco stand and valet podium destroyed as the car barreled through the sidewalk.</p>
