          <p>According to a U.S. official, no U.S. bases in the Middle East have been attacked apart from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. There are currently no reports of damage to Al Udeid. While Iran claims to have fired 14 missiles, the U.S. is still determining the exact number. This attack follows escalating tensions in the region, with Iran claiming it was retaliating for recent U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. The situation remains tense as further assessments are conducted. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell by 6% following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as no casualties were reported, raising hopes for de-escalation. U.S. crude oil futures dropped to $69.31 per barrel, while Brent crude decreased to $72.33. Despite initial concerns, Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles without causing any harm. Analysts suggest the market is pricing in a gradual de-escalation, but the potential for Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz remains a significant risk to global oil supplies (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer 2025 begins, homeowners may consider using home equity loans for expenses like vacations, tuition, or home improvements, but it's crucial to proceed cautiously. A home equity loan provides a lump sum with a fixed interest rate, while a HELOC offers a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Experts advise comparing rates and terms from multiple lenders and using the funds for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-interest debt, rather than discretionary spending. Prudent use of home equity can improve overall financial health (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, alleging the telehealth company sold "illegitimate, knockoff versions" of its weight-loss drug, Wegovy. The Danish drugmaker cited concerns about deceptive marketing practices and patient safety risks. Shares of Hims & Hers plummeted following the announcement, potentially impacting their projected $700 million revenue from weight-loss services. Novo Nordisk will continue selling Wegovy on other telehealth platforms that share their commitment to patient safety, as concerns over compounded drugs persist.</p>

The author connects this trend to anxieties about gender, power, and the influence of conservative propaganda.
