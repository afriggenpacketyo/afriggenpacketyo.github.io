          <p>UK inflation dipped to 2.8% in February, slightly below expectations.  However, economists predict a temporary rise to 3.7% in the third quarter due to accelerating energy costs, and the Bank of England halved its 2025 growth forecast to 0.75%. This presents challenges for the Bank of England's monetary policy.</p>
