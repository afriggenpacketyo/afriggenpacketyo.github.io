          <p>Proposed tariffs by President Donald Trump could substantially raise the prices of goods like clothing and shoes, particularly those imported from China and Vietnam. According to pricing models created by AlixPartners, a 30% tariff on Chinese goods could increase prices by about 19%, while a 145% tariff could cause a spike of roughly 90%. Similarly, tariffs on Vietnamese goods could lead to price increases of 8% to 35%, depending on the tariff level. While retailers may attempt to offset some of these costs, consumers could still face significantly higher prices, impacting household budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is set to review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, following a request from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This review comes amid concerns raised by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims the pill harms women, although experts question the report's methodology and data. Mifepristone was initially approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review deemed it safe and effective, and subsequent reviews have not identified new safety concerns. The upcoming review could potentially impact access to the drug, depending on whether the FDA prioritizes scientific evidence or political considerations. Optimism is moderate as the review's outcome is uncertain and could be influenced by both scientific and political factors.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who claimed she was denied a promotion and later demoted due to her heterosexual orientation. Ames alleged that the Ohio Department of Youth Services, her employer, selected less qualified gay candidates for the positions, and that her supervisor was also gay. The court found that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group, and that the requirement to show 'background circumstances' to support the suspicion of discrimination against the majority is inconsistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, but does not guarantee a successful outcome.</p>

The device automates a person's signature with a pen or other writing instrument, offering a consistent and efficient alternative to manual signing.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a new travel ban restricting entry to the U.S. from nationals of 12 countries, citing national security risks, with additional restrictions placed on seven other countries. The ban affects countries such as Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and Somalia, among others, and includes partial restrictions on countries like Cuba and Venezuela. The White House asserts that these measures are necessary to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, while critics argue that the ban is discriminatory and isolates the U.S. on the world stage. The order includes exemptions for lawful permanent residents, athletes, and those traveling for major sporting events.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of a Wisconsin-based Catholic charity, stating that the state unconstitutionally discriminated against the organization regarding unemployment tax credits. The court found that Wisconsin engaged in an "unnecessary entanglement" by attempting to define whether religious groups should be entitled to a tax exemption based on the stateâ€™s criteria for religious behavior. Justice Sotomayor wrote that the state imposed a denominational preference without the necessary tailoring to survive judicial scrutiny. The Wisconsin Supreme Court had previously ruled that the charity was not "operated primarily for religious purposes" because it serves and employs non-Catholics and does not actively promote the Catholic faith.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin does not have to pay unemployment taxes, marking one of several religious-rights cases the court is considering this term. The Catholic Charities Bureau argued that the state violated the First Amendment's religious freedom guarantee by requiring the organization to pay the tax while exempting other faith groups. Wisconsin contended that the organization's daily work does not involve religious teachings, thus not qualifying it for an exemption. The court also deadlocked on public funding for religious schools and is still deliberating a case regarding religious objections to books in schools.</p>

          <p>Despite criticizing Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul reiterated Germany's commitment to providing arms to Israel during a meeting with Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar in Berlin. Wadephul urged Israel to allow unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza and condemned the expansion of settlements in the West Bank. Saar requested Germany to consider an alternative aid distribution foundation in Gaza to prevent Hamas from appropriating aid. Wadephul emphasized Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas and stated that recognizing a Palestinian state now would send the wrong signal.</p>
