          <p>Following President Trump's order, California National Guard troops have arrived in Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests. The deployment of 2,000 service members comes after clashes between demonstrators and federal agents executing immigration enforcement actions, resulting in over 100 arrests. The White House cited attacks on ICE officers as justification, while Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local authorities have sufficient resources. Defense Secretary Hegseth threatened to deploy U.S. Marines if violence continues, escalating the situation further. The presence of the National Guard aims to maintain order amidst escalating tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>USA Gymnastics has removed its transgender eligibility policy pages from its website, with the timing of the removal currently unknown. This action follows a social media feud between Simone Biles and Riley Gaines regarding trans athlete inclusion. The removed pages previously outlined the organization's policies, including a 2020 announcement that trans athletes were no longer required to undergo sex reassignment or hormone therapy to compete. Other sports organizations, such as USA Track and Field and USA Fencing, have also quietly amended their transgender policies amid rising opposition to trans inclusion in women's sports.</p>

          <p>Another series of unmarked graves containing the remains of 14 individuals from Greece's civil war era have been discovered in a park in Thessaloniki. The bodies are believed to belong to prisoners, alleged communists and sympathizers, who were executed between 1946 and 1953 at the nearby Yedi Kule castle. The remains were found during renovation work, with torsos and heads separated, indicating hasty burials. Relatives of the executed have called for DNA testing to identify the bodies.</p>

          <p>Political analyst Charles M. Blow discusses the current state of racial justice in America, noting a decline in pluralism and the erasure of Black history. He highlights the challenges faced by Emancipation Park in Houston, where corporate sponsors have become hesitant to support Juneteenth-related activities. Blow also points to the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural in Washington, D.C., and the cancellation of Juneteenth celebrations in multiple cities. He argues that America's youngest national holiday is now caught in the crossfire of America's culture wars.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, stated that Israel would prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip. Katz said that Israel wouldn't allow anyone to break its naval blockade of the Palestinian territory, which he said was aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. The Madleen, carrying 12 activists, is operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which says they are a grassroots movement working to end Israel's blockade of Gaza. The coalition accused Israel of jamming their communication as they approached about 160 nautical miles from Gaza.</p>

The image confirmed the J-36’s three weapons bays – one large and two smaller – and the dorsal intake for the third engine.

Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, leading to disapproval. The poll also shows concerns about the economic impact and the potential for legal residents to be mistakenly deported.</p>

          <p>The article critiques America's obsession with narratives about powerful men and their origin stories, particularly in the tech industry. It argues that this infatuation has led to a system where wealth and political power are concentrated in the hands of a few, and that the focus on individual genius often overlooks ethical failings. The author uses examples such as Adam Neumann of WeWork, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Alexander Hamilton to illustrate how these narratives perpetuate an unjust status quo and hinder societal progress. The fickle winds of marketing may finally be blowing against these self-styled Great Men.</p>
