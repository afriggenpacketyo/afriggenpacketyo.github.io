        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer with ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the next Surgeon General, replacing his initial pick, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Means, known for her skepticism towards the traditional medical system and co-authorship of "Good Energy," advocates for addressing metabolic dysfunction as the root of chronic diseases. Her brother, Calley Means, is a top advisor to Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the siblings have gained popularity among conservatives through appearances on podcasts. This appointment signals a shift towards alternative health perspectives within the administration, particularly with the influence of Secretary Kennedy.</p>

          <p>Columbia University requested the New York City Police Department's assistance to remove pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupying the campus library, citing safety concerns and the presence of non-affiliated individuals. Acting University President Claire Shipman stated that this action was necessary due to disruptions and attempts to force entry into Butler Library, where protesters vandalized property and refused to identify themselves. Two public safety officers were reportedly injured during a crowd surge, and the university is facing pressure from the Trump administration regarding campus protests. The university has announced that students involved in the protest will face disciplinary consequences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cargo volume at the Port of Los Angeles has decreased by 35% following increased tariffs, significantly impacting local businesses dependent on port activity, according to a recent report. This decline affects longshore workers, trucking companies, and distribution centers, with potential broader effects on manufacturers, retailers, and consumers nationwide. Port officials anticipate potential shortages and price hikes in the coming weeks as stockpiled inventory depletes. The port complex, which handles a substantial portion of U.S. container traffic, is facing long-term concerns even if tariffs are reduced due to the complexities of restoring shipping schedules.</p>

          <p>A piece of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere this week. NASA believes that the lander probe, a durable, spherical object, may partially survive the re-entry process. While the exact landing location remains uncertain, experts consider the risk to people on the ground to be low, as most of the planet is covered by water. The spacecraft never escaped low Earth orbit, and this re-entry marks the end of its over half-century journey.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to reduce interest rates, potentially cutting them to 4.25% from 4.5%, with further reductions expected later in the year, according to analysts. This move aims to lower borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, although it may also result in lower returns for savers. The Monetary Policy Committee is closely monitoring inflation, which currently stands at 2.6%, but is expected to rise due to recent bill increases, as well as global economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing a violation of their due process rights. The order was issued in response to reports that the U.S. military could begin flying migrants to the conflict-ridden North African country. Libya's prime minister has stated the country refuses to be a destination for migrant deportations. The judge's ruling emphasizes that the deportations would defy a previous injunction requiring officials to provide migrants with written notice in their language and a meaningful opportunity to file a claim against removal.</p>
