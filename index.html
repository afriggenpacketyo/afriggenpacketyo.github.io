          <p>Police have initiated a corporate manslaughter investigation into alleged failures at maternity units within the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS trust. The investigation will focus on whether maternity care provided by the trust, which oversees the Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital, constituted gross negligence. This development comes as the trust faces scrutiny from the largest maternity inquiry in NHS history, with approximately 2,500 cases under examination by independent midwife Donna Ockenden. The inquiry aims to determine the extent and causes of any potential harm to mothers and infants. The investigation will center on two maternity units overseen by the trust.</p>

          <p>A suspect identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including the use of an incendiary device, after allegedly attacking a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado. The incident, described by officials as a "targeted terror attack" and "ideologically motivated violence," resulted in eight people being hospitalized with burns, ranging in age from 52 to 88. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack, which involved a "makeshift flamethrower" and an incendiary device. The FBI is investigating the incident, which has been condemned as an act of antisemitism, especially given its occurrence on the eve of the Jewish holiday Shavuot.</p>

Nagasaki intends to extend invitations to all countries and regions that have diplomatic missions in Japan or representative offices at the United Nations, categories into which Taiwan does not fall.

          <p>Tennis legend Martina Navratilova has voiced her support for two Oregon high school athletes who declined to share the podium with a transgender athlete during the girls' high jump state championships. Reese Eckard and Alexa Anderson stepped down from the podium to protest the inclusion of the transgender athlete. Navratilova criticized the situation as an example of misogyny and lamented the failure of Democratic lawmakers to support legislation protecting women's sports. She has been a vocal advocate for restricting female sports to biological women and has questioned the sacrifices Democrats are willing to make to accommodate transgender athletes.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has acknowledged that "frustration" led to his collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, admitting that the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened." The incident resulted in a 10-second penalty for Verstappen, dropping him from fifth to tenth place in the race. Russell had criticized Verstappen's driving, suggesting he deliberately drove into the Mercedes car. Verstappen initially dismissed Russell's comments but later apologized for his actions, which also resulted in three penalty points on his license, bringing him close to a race ban.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are scheduled to meet in Istanbul, Turkey, for another round of peace talks brokered by the U.S., aiming to resolve the ongoing conflict. These talks occur amidst heightened tensions, including a recent Ukrainian drone attack on strategic bomber bases deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine seeks a full 30-day ceasefire to facilitate negotiations, while Russia insists on maximalist war goals, including annexation of Ukrainian regions. Despite international pressure and previous discussions, a lasting peace deal or sustained ceasefire remains elusive, and both sides continue to accuse each other of sabotaging the process.</p>

          <p>Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as the new president of Poland, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. With all votes counted, Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the vote, marking a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that had predicted a victory for Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The result is likely to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition party and has said he does not want to see the country joining NATO and the EU during Russia's ongoing aggression.</p>

They worry that changing recommendations and potential loss of insurance coverage will limit access to vaccines, and some feel betrayed by the Trump administration's actions.

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget bill is facing criticism for its significant tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, coupled with substantial cuts to social safety net programs. The bill would cut taxes by over $600 billion for the top 1% of wage earners while reducing Medicaid and SNAP benefits, potentially leaving millions without healthcare or food assistance. Critics argue that this legislation continues a trend of Republican presidents increasing the federal debt while disproportionately benefiting corporations and the wealthy. The bill's provisions also include non-economic measures, such as easing regulations on gun silencers and limiting the power of courts to enforce injunctions.</p>

          <p>Americans for Prosperity, a GOP-friendly organization, is launching a $4 million advertising campaign to support President Trump's tax agenda. The campaign aims to influence the Senate's consideration of the bill, which includes key provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The messaging will include testimonials highlighting the impact of the 2017 tax cuts and urging fiscal hawks to eliminate wasteful spending.

This shift marks a significant departure from the "whole language" approach, which has been prevalent in California for decades.
