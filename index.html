        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During her book tour for "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized her strong relationship with Hillary and Bill Clinton, contrasting it with the reported friction between her and former President Joe Biden's allies. Her memoir contains critiques of Biden's 2024 re-election campaign and his staff's handling of her vice presidency, which has drawn criticism from former White House officials. Harris recounted that the Clintons were among the first to offer their full support after Biden withdrew from the race, portraying them as key mentors and backers in her political journey.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations of deceiving customers into enrolling in its Prime subscription service and complicating cancellation. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and requires Amazon to refund $1.5 billion to approximately 35 million affected customers. As part of the agreement, which came three days into a federal trial, Amazon must also make its enrollment and cancellation processes clearer and more straightforward for consumers, though the company did not admit to any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Virginia have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to criminally charge former FBI Director James Comey with lying to Congress, according to sources familiar with the matter. A detailed memo recommending against prosecution was presented to Lindsey Halligan, the newly appointed U.S. attorney who reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury anyway. This move follows President Trump's directive to prosecute political adversaries and comes as the five-year statute of limitations for the alleged false statements is about to expire, raising ethical concerns among career prosecutors.</p>

          <p>The FBI has revealed that the suspect in the deadly shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility engaged in significant pre-attack planning. Evidence indicates the suspect, Joshua Jahn, researched DHS facility locations, ballistics, and apps for tracking ICE agents before the attack, which killed one detainee and injured two others. Handwritten notes recovered from the scene expressed a desire to instill "real terror" in ICE agents, pointing to a politically motivated act of violence amid heightened national tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has partly upheld complaints against the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set, ruling it breached guidelines on harm and offence. The performance included chants of "death, death to the IDF" and other derogatory comments, which the unit determined could be characterized as antisemitic. However, the broadcast was cleared of breaching rules on impartiality and incitement to crime, as the comments were directed at an institution rather than individuals and musical festival coverage has different standards than news programming.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has suspended certain cloud services, including Azure storage and AI subscriptions, for Unit 8200 of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The decision follows the company's investigation into a report by The Guardian alleging the unit built a system to track Palestinians' phone calls. Microsoft President Brad Smith stated that the company's review found evidence supporting the report's claims, leading to the disabling of the services. This action occurs amid pressure from Microsoft employees protesting the use of the company's technology in the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to approve a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a full ban mandated by a bipartisan law. The agreement establishes a joint venture with a majority of U.S. investors, including Oracle, which will host American user data and review the app's code for security. Under the deal, TikTok's parent company ByteDance will retain a 19.9% stake, and its content algorithm will be copied and retrained using only U.S. user data to satisfy national security concerns.</p>

While Burnham claims some MPs have encouraged him to stand, many others have expressed that a leadership contest so soon after the last election would be self-indulgent and damaging. Critics within the party are urging him to focus on his current role, highlighting the significant barriers he would face in returning to Parliament to mount a challenge.</p>

          <p>The founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, have been accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million in a Ponzi-like scheme. The duo acquired several distressed retail brands, including RadioShack, Pier 1 Imports, and Modell's Sporting Goods, with the promise of transforming them into profitable online businesses. The SEC alleges they misrepresented the financial health of these companies and used funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier ones, while also diverting millions for personal use.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has initiated a gradual restart of its operations after a significant cyber-attack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT systems and production lines. The company reports that some financial and parts logistics systems are back online, allowing it to process payments to suppliers and manage vehicle sales, though its manufacturing plants remain closed until at least next month. The prolonged shutdown has raised concerns about the financial stability of smaller firms in JLR's supply chain, prompting the UK government to consider intervention measures.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered in Barcelona in 2005, known only as "the woman in pink," has been identified as 31-year-old Russian national Liudmila Zavada. The breakthrough came through Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, which shares details of cold cases involving unidentified women in Europe. Police in Turkey matched the woman's fingerprints to Zavada in their national database, and a DNA sample from a close relative confirmed the identification. This marks the third successful identification resulting from the international public awareness and law enforcement cooperation initiative.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggests that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, currently traveling through our solar system, could be far larger and more massive than previously estimated. By studying its trajectory and the rate at which it sheds gas and dust, researchers inferred its mass must exceed 33 billion tons, implying a diameter greater than 3.1 miles. This would make it orders of magnitude more massive than the other two known interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, deepening the mystery surrounding its origins and composition.</p>

          <p>Shares of used-car retailer CarMax fell by more than 20% after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street expectations. The company cited a challenging market, including a pull-ahead in sales earlier in the year and depreciation of its inventory, for the lackluster performance. Overall vehicle sales declined by 4.1% compared to the same period last year, contributing to a nearly 28% drop in net income. CarMax's results are often viewed as a barometer for the broader auto retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

These immediate and tangible financial burdens are already affecting households and businesses, demonstrating that the economic consequences of climate change are a present-day reality, not just a future threat.</p>
