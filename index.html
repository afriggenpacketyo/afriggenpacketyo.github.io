          <p>Following a week of aerial attacks between Israel and Iran, and after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran, President Trump announced that both countries have agreed to a ceasefire. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is considered over. Iran's missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which caused no casualties, prompted Trump to praise both countries for their willingness to end what he called "THE 12 DAY WAR." This announcement comes amidst bipartisan debate in Congress regarding the president's war powers. The relative stability and lack of further escalation suggests a tentative move towards de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites has sparked debate in Congress regarding war powers, with some lawmakers demanding a vote to reassert Congress's constitutional authority to declare war. While House Speaker Mike Johnson deems the push irrelevant due to the announced ceasefire, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries criticize Trump for not briefing Congress adequately before the strikes. Jeffries questions the imminent threat posed by Iran and accuses the president of potentially misleading the public. Despite the ceasefire announcement, some lawmakers are still calling for a vote on war powers resolutions to prevent unilateral action by the president. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and legislative branches regarding military action.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles at the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which were intercepted. Middle East security expert Burcu Ozcelik suggests that potential Iranian responses could include attacks on U.S. military assets across the Middle East, closure of the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric warfare tactics like terror and cyber attacks. The U.S. operates numerous bases in the Middle East, including Al Udeid in Qatar and Naval Support Activity Bahrain. Closing the Strait of Hormuz could cause significant economic disruption, impacting global oil prices. Despite the threats, the article suggests that Iran's actions would likely invite a response from the U.S., potentially jeopardizing the Iranian government's survival.</p>

          <p>Iran retaliated against the U.S. by firing missiles at the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, prompting discussion about the base's significance and the broader U.S. military presence in the Middle East. The Al Udeid Air Base serves as the forward headquarters for U.S. Central Command and houses thousands of U.S. troops. President Trump characterized the attack as a weak response that was expected and effectively countered. The U.S. maintains military bases in several other Middle Eastern countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria.

Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the court of rewarding lawlessness and disregarding the due process rights of the immigrants.

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel believes that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil shipping passage, despite recent threats. He argues that closing the strait would harm Iran's own oil exports, which amount to 1.7 million barrels per day. Braziel notes that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped on Monday. He also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are creating issues for exporters, as the market now views U.S. energy commodity exporters as untrustworthy suppliers.

He also announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing for it in advance.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missiles aimed at a U.S. base in Qatar, but reports indicate that all missiles were intercepted. President Trump claimed that Iran's response was weak and that a ceasefire had been agreed upon. If no further Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to hold his fire and hopes for genuine negotiations. This scenario suggests that Trump's high-risk maneuver may yield positive results, similar to the 2020 Soleimani killing, where the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iran's retaliatory missile strikes. The relative stability and lack of further escalation suggests a tentative move towards de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on oil and gas supplies, potentially leading to higher energy prices for Americans. Although oil prices initially surged, they later fell as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz. The geopolitical crisis has sparked concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's oil supply, impacting global energy costs. Experts note that ongoing tensions could disrupt the energy market, but a limited disruption would likely cause only temporary spikes in global energy prices.

Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while Article II designates the president as Commander in Chief. Some experts argue that Article II allows the president to use military force in certain circumstances, such as responding to actual or anticipated attacks. Others argue that Trump lacked the authority to launch the strikes without congressional approval, particularly in the absence of a sudden attack or imminent threat.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, “Elio,” had a disappointing opening weekend, marking the lowest domestic opening in Pixar's history. The film earned $21 million in the U.S. and Canada, falling short of expectations. Analysts suggest that the movie's performance may be attributed to the challenges faced by original animated films in attracting audiences, competition from other family-friendly movies, and potentially ineffective marketing. Disney remains optimistic that “Elio” will gain traction throughout the summer, similar to the success of “Elemental.”</p>
