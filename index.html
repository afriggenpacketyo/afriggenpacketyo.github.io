          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of new video footage has determined that Israel struck the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack. The assault, which killed at least 20 people including five journalists, was initially reported as two strikes. However, the investigation revealed two staircases were hit simultaneously, followed by a "double-tap" strike nine minutes later on first responders and media. The Israel Defense Forces' narrative has evolved since the attack, which international legal experts suggest may have violated the laws of war by targeting a protected facility.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has fired a total of four employees following a protest and break-in at the office of company president Brad Smith. The demonstration was organized by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid,' composed of tech workers demanding Microsoft sever ties with Israel. The protest was spurred by reports that an Israeli military unit uses the company's Azure cloud platform for surveillance of Palestinians. While Microsoft has launched an investigation into the use of its technology, it maintains the employees' actions were unacceptable violations of company policy.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama has voiced concerns over what he described as "dangerous trends" from the Trump administration, specifically citing President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to combat crime in cities like Chicago. Obama warned that the increasing use of military forces for domestic policing erodes fundamental principles like due process and puts the liberties of all Americans at risk. The criticism comes as Trump has publicly suggested federal intervention in Chicago, a move that has been met with strong resistance from Illinois' Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people, including four children, and wounded dozens more. Ukrainian officials reported it was one of the largest assaults on the capital in weeks, with civilian buildings and a European Union Delegation office among the targets. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate killing of civilians and called for stronger international sanctions against Russia. The assault occurs amid struggling U.S.-led peace efforts to end the prolonged war.</p>

          <p>Jim O'Neill, a deputy at the Department of Health and Human Services, has been appointed as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The appointment follows the abrupt termination of the agency's Senate-confirmed leader, Susan Monarez, who was fired after just weeks in the role. Monarez's lawyers contend her firing was unlawful and that she was targeted for resisting "unscientific, reckless directives" from the Trump administration. The leadership change occurs amidst significant turmoil at the CDC, including other high-level resignations and criticism of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies.</p>

          <p>Authorities have released more information about the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, where a gunman killed two children and injured 18 other people before taking his own life. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, legally purchased three firearms and fired over 100 rifle rounds through church windows during a school Mass. Investigators are examining a video manifesto Westman scheduled to post online, which reportedly contained hateful writings and an obsession with past mass shootings. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

          <p>Robert “Bobby” Salazar, a 63-year-old Fresno restaurant owner, has been federally charged with hiring a motorcycle gang member to set his own underperforming restaurant on fire for an insurance payout. Prosecutors allege that after closing the location, Salazar increased its insurance coverage before arranging the arson, which resulted in a claim of nearly $1 million. The investigation connected Salazar to the arson through surveillance footage and phone records of an accomplice. Court documents also reveal that Salazar has an alleged history of arson, including previous incidents targeting a former employee and his former brother-in-law.</p>

These fabricated images, or "AI slop," depict fictional scenes from concentration camps and are used to drive engagement, which is monetized through Meta's content programs. Holocaust memorial organizations have condemned the practice, stating it distresses survivors, disrespects victims, and dangerously distorts history. The investigation traced many of these accounts to content creators in Pakistan who are exploiting the platform's algorithms by creating emotionally manipulative, historically inaccurate content for Western audiences.</p>

The school board had narrowly voted to display the flags as part of a resolution to combat antisemitism, a move that sparked controversy. Supporters viewed it as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish community, while critics argued it was an inappropriate endorsement of a foreign government in a public school setting. Citing his executive authority, the superintendent has mandated that only U.S. and California state flags will be displayed for the time being.</p>

The responsible department based its savings estimates on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its findings, now suggesting that the reorganization might not produce any savings and could even incur additional costs depending on how it is implemented. Critics argue it is astonishing that the government would proceed with such a large-scale reform without commissioning independent, up-to-date analysis.</p>

Kennedy Jr. Key moments include the dismissal of the CDC's entire independent vaccine advisory panel and subsequent updates to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, which have created friction and instability within the federal health agency.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has advanced to the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory, demonstrating strong form after a recent controversy. Three weeks prior, Osaka was criticized for her runner-up speech after a difficult loss in the Montreal final, an event she says left her feeling shame. However, she has since won eight of her last nine matches and appears to be regaining momentum on the court. After her win, Osaka also commented on a separate controversy involving another player, offering a nuanced perspective on the historical context of certain remarks in the sport.</p>

          <p>A BBC report details the accounts of 40 Rohingya refugees who were allegedly deported from India and abandoned in the Andaman Sea by Indian authorities. The refugees, who had been living in Delhi, were taken into custody, flown to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and then forced onto a naval vessel. They testify that they were bound, had their faces covered, and were ultimately forced into the sea with life jackets, eventually reaching Myanmar, the country they had originally fled. The UN's special rapporteur says there is "significant evidence" supporting these allegations of refoulement, which puts the refugees' lives at extreme risk.</p>

          <p>During the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, older middle school students are being praised for their heroic actions in protecting younger children. According to officials and parents, as the gunfire began, these students immediately shielded their younger "buddies" — part of a school mentorship program — by pushing them under the pews and covering them. This act of bravery is credited with saving lives, though it also meant that many of the older children were the ones who sustained injuries. The two children who were killed were 8 and 10 years old.</p>

          <p>Canadian officials have issued a warning after an angler discovered an enormous, 26-kilogram grass carp in Lake Huron, a location where the invasive species does not belong. Although the fish was sterile and could not reproduce, its presence highlights the ongoing threat that invasive carp pose to the Great Lakes ecosystem. Grass carp are highly destructive, consuming up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, which degrades habitats for native species. Authorities are conducting surveillance and have urged the public to report any sightings of the fish and not to release them back into the water.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) technology may be a liability for the brand, with more U.S. consumers saying it would make them less likely to buy a Tesla than more likely. The report from Slingshot Strategies found that 35% of respondents were turned off by FSD, while only 14% saw it as an incentive. The findings suggest a market education and trust problem for Tesla, which has heavily promoted the technology as a key advantage, even as the company faces a sales slump and increased competition.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA). The judge affirmed that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally established advisory panel, which currently lacks the members to form a quorum. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to reshape the federally funded international broadcaster, which has seen its operations drastically reduced under Lake's leadership. The judge stated that the administration's attempts to remove Abramowitz did not comply with statutory requirements designed to insulate VOA from political pressure.</p>

This dynamic reflects a deep entanglement of historical trauma, ongoing geopolitical rivalry, and strong economic and cultural ties. The relationship is characterized by a persistent tension between remembering past atrocities and embracing contemporary cultural and economic exchange.</p>

The comparison was prompted by a recent Cabinet meeting and Trump's statement that he has "the right to do anything I want" as president.

          <p>An import tax exception known as "de minimis," which has allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. duty-free for decades, is being suspended by a presidential executive order. Since 2015, the rule exempted goods valued under $800, a loophole that greatly benefited online retailers like Temu and Shein that ship cheap goods directly from China. The suspension means all incoming shipments will now be subject to an import tax, which will likely lead to higher prices for American consumers on a wide range of imported products.
