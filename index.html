          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, reported first-quarter results that surpassed estimates and announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion. While the bank's profit declined 25% year-on-year, it surged nearly 317% from the previous quarter. Group CEO Georges Elhedery emphasized the company's strong earnings momentum and confidence in meeting targets despite economic uncertainty. The bank's restructuring plan, announced last October, aims to yield $300 million in cost reductions this year, although potential headwinds from tariffs and global recession remain a concern.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a surprising victory in the Canadian federal election, largely attributed to a backlash against Donald Trump's rhetoric and trade threats. The Liberal Party's platform focused on safeguarding Canada's sovereignty and economy against Trump's policies, effectively contrasting with the Conservative Party's domestic-focused campaign. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully leveraged his experience to address economic anxieties and frame the election as a critical moment for Canada's future. While the Conservatives gained seats, the Liberal's anti-Trump message resonated with voters, securing their win.</p>

          <p>Three teenagers were wounded in a shooting in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, prompting a police search for the gunman. The Los Angeles Police Department responded to reports of a multi-victim shooting on North Soto Street, where a 15-year-old, a 16-year-old, and an 18-year-old sustained non-life-threatening gunshot wounds and were transported to local hospitals. The suspect, described as a heavyset man wearing a tie-dyed sweatshirt and blue pants, was last seen traveling northbound in a gray BMW sedan. The incident led to a significant law enforcement presence and the closure of North Soto Street in both directions.</p>

Ryan O'Hearn's three-run home run in the third inning provided the Orioles with a significant lead. Sugano's ERA of 3.00 is currently the best among Orioles starters, highlighting his impact on the team's pitching rotation.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured an unexpected victory in Canada's federal election, fueled by anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over national sovereignty. The election focused heavily on Trump's tariff threats and annexation comments, allowing Carney to position himself as a defender of Canada's economic survival. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, gained ground but ultimately fell short due to the progressive vote consolidating behind the Liberals. Carney plans to renegotiate the economic and security relationship with the U.S. immediately, signaling a shift in Canada's approach to its neighbor.</p>

          <p>China's military is rapidly deploying low-cost, AI-powered drones, including a new micro drone designed for infantry units. This drone features a coaxial dual-rotor system, allowing it to carry twice its own weight, and can perform both reconnaissance and attack missions. Equipped with an on-board neural processing unit, the drone supports AI-powered targeting and allows one operator to manage multiple drones simultaneously. This expansion is part of a "phased leap" in unmanned combat technology, aiming for deep integration within operations and eventual autonomy, which is considered vital for gaining an edge in intelligent warfare.</p>

          <p>Asean member states risk isolation by China and stalled growth if they align too closely with the US in the trade war, according to Chinese political scientist Zheng Yongnian. He suggested that the US aims to bring manufacturing back to the country rather than assist Asean in its re-industrialization efforts. Zheng cautioned that Asean countries could face greater challenges if their economic and trade relations with China are not managed well. He emphasized that China is better positioned to help the 10-nation regional bloc achieve its goals.</p>

The Metropolitan Police are also reviewing a separate video from November 2024 where a band member allegedly shouted support for Hamas and Hezbollah, both proscribed terrorist organizations in the UK.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security is conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the U.S. alone, often across the U.S.-Mexican border. These actions have raised concerns about a crackdown and "backdoor family separation."
