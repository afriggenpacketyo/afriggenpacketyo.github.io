          <p>Oscar Piastri secured victory at the Spanish Grand Prix after Max Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for causing a collision. Verstappen's car wobbled after a restart, leading to contact with Charles Leclerc and later with George Russell, resulting in the penalty. Stewards determined that Verstappen accelerated suddenly and collided with Russell, leading to three penalty points on his license. Piastri's win extends his championship lead over Norris by 10 points, while Verstappen trails by 49 points after an eventful race. </p>

          <p>FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary addressed concerns about a new COVID variant circulating in Asia, suggesting it behaves like a common cold virus with cross-immunity protection from previous strains. He clarified the CDC's updated recommendations on COVID vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, emphasizing shared clinical decision-making between patients and doctors. Dr. Makary expressed skepticism about blanket recommendations for repeat boosters without sufficient clinical data, advocating for an evidence-based approach. He also questioned the reliability of CDC data regarding COVID hospitalizations, suggesting it may include false positives from incidental testing, advocating for more transparency and randomized control trials before making universal recommendations. Optimism that the current COVID situation is stable and being appropriately addressed is reflected in the careful considerations being made. </p>

          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for a large-scale operation targeting four Russian military airfields, alleging the destruction of over 40 military aircraft.

The Russian Ministry of Defense acknowledged the attacks, reporting fires at airfields in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions and claiming that some participants were detained. Separately, railway bridges collapsed in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk regions, resulting in casualties and accusations of Ukrainian involvement, which Ukrainian officials have disputed. </p>

Doctors at Nasser Hospital reported receiving about 200 people with injuries caused by bullets or shrapnel, while the IDF stated that initial findings indicate its forces did not fire at Gazans near or within aid points. The incident underscores the dire humanitarian conditions in Rafah, where access to aid and emergency services is severely limited due to recent Israeli military operations. </p>

          <p>Prison officers dealing with violent inmates should be armed, the shadow justice secretary has said. Specialist guards should have Taser stun guns and baton rounds - a less lethal alternative to traditional bullets - to give them "confidence" in handling threats, Robert Jenrick told the BBC. The Conservatives said secure armouries should be introduced at maximum security jails and used as a last resort. Prison officers in adult male prisons currently only carry an extendable baton and Pava, a synthetic pepper spray.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party in the UK is advocating for arming prison officers dealing with violent inmates, proposing that specialist guards should have Taser stun guns and baton rounds. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick stated that this would give officers “confidence” in handling threats, and secure armories should be introduced at maximum security jails. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said some prison officers will use Tasers on a trial basis this summer, but argued that giving them lethal weapons would put them at greater risk. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) has called for stronger protection for staff after a series of attacks. </p>

The election is expected to be tight, with polls showing the difference between the candidates within the margin of error.

The drone attack came as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site.

          <p>Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has pitched Elon Musk’s remarks about accelerating GDP growth as a case for Bitcoin. Horsley stated that “every sign in the world is saying monetary debasement is the road ahead,” emphasizing Bitcoin's potential as a hedge against currency debasement. Musk said last week that accelerating GDP growth was the only way the U.S. could get out of its fiscal quagmire. Horsley’s sentiments come as efforts to accelerate GDP growth are likely to involve increasing the monetary supply to stimulate economic activity, which could lead to the debasement of the dollar.

David, now a domestic abuse campaigner, has written a book, called The Unthinkable, about the family's experiences, and said more needs to be done to protect victims.
