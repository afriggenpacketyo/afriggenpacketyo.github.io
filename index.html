          <p>Following days of escalating protests against immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, President Trump deployed National Guard troops to the city. Protests have erupted throughout L.A. County, with clashes occurring between law enforcement and demonstrators, resulting in multiple injuries and arrests. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, requesting its rescission, while Mayor Bass described it as a chaotic escalation of the situation, while former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her dismay, and Rep. Maxine Waters labeled it a disruption. The protests began after ICE confirmed operations resulting in arrests, including a "domestic abuser" and a "child sexual assaulter."</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein's book "Abundance," co-written with Derek Thompson, has sparked debate within the Democratic Party regarding its focus on increasing production and addressing bottlenecks. While some Democrats embrace the book's critique of governance and its emphasis on building more housing and expanding energy production, others on the populist left view it as a threat to their anti-corporate agenda. The debate centers on whether the party should prioritize tackling concentrated power or focusing on expanding access to essential resources. The backlash highlights a fundamental disagreement within the party about the core problems facing American society.</p>

          <p>Israel's Mossad carried out a covert operation that severely weakened Hezbollah by detonating explosive pagers and walkie-talkies, leading to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The attack has diminished Iran's power and influence in the region, as Hezbollah's losses have cut off critical support and resources. Experts believe that Iran's proxy war strategy, which relies on Hezbollah to advance its interests, is failing due to the group's weakened state and the loss of key territories. This has significantly altered the balance of power in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Britain's energy system faces challenges in efficiently distributing renewable energy, leading to compensation payments to companies like Ocean Winds for turning down their output due to grid overload. This balancing act, also requiring gas-fired power stations to provide more electricity, has cost the country over Â£500 million this year alone. The government is considering a radical solution of regional pricing to address these inefficiencies and lower bills, but the proposal has sparked intense debate within the energy industry. The potential for renewables to deliver lower costs is hindered by grid limitations, prompting the need for innovative solutions to ensure a sustainable and affordable energy supply.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw pitched effectively, earning his first win of the season as the Dodgers defeated the Cardinals 7-3, ending a two-game losing streak. Kershaw gave up just a run on six hits over five innings and struck out seven, providing a much-needed lift to a slumping team. The offense also contributed, scoring seven runs, their highest total this month. The victory helps stabilize the Dodgers' rotation amid injuries and sets the stage for their upcoming series against the Padres.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching Gaza, citing the need to maintain its naval blockade. Israel Katz stated that the country would not allow anyone to break the blockade, which it claims is necessary to prevent Hamas from importing arms. Thunberg and other activists are aboard the Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which aims to end Israel's blockade of Gaza. Israel's military campaign has killed over 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>
