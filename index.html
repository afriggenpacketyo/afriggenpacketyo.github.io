          <p>Protests erupted across Los Angeles after Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations led to numerous arrests. President Trump responded by deploying at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. County, citing clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. The ICE operations targeted employers suspected of using fictitious documents for workers, leading to tense confrontations. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated city officials are working with federal authorities to find a path forward. The situation underscores the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the response from both federal and local authorities. </p>
