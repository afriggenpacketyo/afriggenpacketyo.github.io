          <p>The article chronicles Ousmane Dembélé's remarkable career turnaround, culminating in his first Ballon d'Or win. After years of battling injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, his move to Paris St-Germain, particularly after Kylian Mbappé's departure, allowed him to flourish in a new central role. Encouraged by manager Luis Enrique to be more goal-oriented, Dembélé achieved career-best statistics, scoring 35 goals and leading PSG to a historic treble. The piece also attributes his transformation to personal growth, including his marriage and fatherhood, which brought a new level of maturity and professionalism to his career.</p>

Routh, who is representing himself, has chosen not to testify, signaling that the trial is nearing its final phase. The newsletter also briefly touches on other political stories, including a new Federal Reserve governor's vow of independence, calls for colleges to punish faculty for controversial speech, and tensions on Capitol Hill over a potential government shutdown.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to reconsider a 90-year-old precedent that shields officials at independent federal agencies from being fired at will by the president. This decision follows recent rulings where the court's conservative majority upheld President Trump's removal of appointees from various boards, signaling a potential shift in the separation of powers. The case specifically questions the legality of statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission, potentially overturning the 1935 landmark decision in *Humphrey's Executor*. The court's liberal justices have dissented, warning that these actions transfer authority from Congress to the President.</p>

The White House clarified that the one-time fee applies only to initial applications, not to current visa holders or renewals, and is intended to encourage hiring American workers. However, immigration attorneys express concern over gray areas, such as whether current visa holders who travel abroad while an extension is pending could be subject to the fee upon re-entry. This uncertainty has led some companies to advise their H-1B employees against international travel for the time being.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity have slightly cheaper options, but the choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) requires careful consideration. Currently, a HELOC offers a marginally lower monthly payment due to its variable interest rate, which benefits from the rate cut. However, a home equity loan provides the stability of a a fixed rate, protecting borrowers from future rate increases. The article advises homeowners to weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term predictability of a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident is part of a broader pattern of Russian provocations against NATO members, prompting Estonia to invoke Article 4 consultations.
