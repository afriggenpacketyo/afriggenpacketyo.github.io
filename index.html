          <p>Analysts warn that the potential for a trade war has not completely dissipated despite U.S. President Donald Trump's delay of rolling out 50% tariffs on the European Union. Trump agreed to push the rollout of the punitive import duties back to July 9, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Experts suggest that the EU is unlikely to capitulate to Trump's shock tactics, and massive uncertainty remains regarding the U.S. President's specific demands, making the situation volatile for businesses and consumers. The situation remains uncertain, with the possibility of further escalation and market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Businesses in Britain and the US are reportedly "rebranding" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to sidestep potential political backlash. This shift involves reframing policies under terms like "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture," with some US-headquartered firms scaling back public celebrations of inclusion work. Experts suggest this trend reflects a broader concern that DEI has become a politically charged term, leading organizations to disguise their efforts to promote talent and address inequalities. While a full-scale rollback is considered unlikely in the UK due to legal protections, some companies are discouraging employees from speaking out on DEI-related issues.</p>

          <p>Despite portents of democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, America's democracy exhibits resilience due to several exceptional traits. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition. These factors provide checks and balances against potential authoritarian overreach, empowering resistance and safeguarding fundamental rights. The observations do not encourage complacency or diminish the harm already caused by Trumpâ€™s authoritarian moves, but they do give hope.</p>

          <h2>Exploring a New Perspective on Climate Change and the Animate Earth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the concept of viewing the Earth and its elements, such as rivers and glaciers, as animate beings with inherent rights. Referencing Robert Macfarlane's book, "Is a River Alive?", the piece discusses the Rights of Nature movement and its efforts to grant legal protections to natural entities. It argues that recognizing the aliveness of what we have been taught to think of as inert matter demands, above all else, time and attention. The author contends that this shift in perspective is crucial for addressing the climate crisis, moving beyond a purely scientific approach to embrace a more holistic understanding of our relationship with the environment.</p>

          <p>The author argues for a new Memorial Day to honor civilian victims of war, highlighting the disproportionate number of non-combatant deaths throughout history. While the U.S. has Memorial Day to honor fallen soldiers, there are few monuments to commemorate the far greater number of civilians killed in conflicts. The author contends that recognizing civilian deaths would acknowledge the true cost of war and encourage a greater appreciation for peace. This would also acknowledge the sacrifices of those who died without a rifle in hand, who died in childhood and infancy, who died because they could not fight and could not be protected, shows war for what it ultimately is: a waste.</p>

States are mandating and funding wellness initiatives, addressing the high rates of depression, burnout, and PTSD among law enforcement officers.</p>
