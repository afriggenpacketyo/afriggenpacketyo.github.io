          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty in New York federal court to charges related to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot in Manhattan in December. Mangione, a 26-year-old, faces a potential death sentence, as prosecutors argue the killing was ideologically motivated due to his anger towards the health insurance industry and involved substantial planning. The Justice Department formally notified the court of its intent to seek the death penalty, citing Mangione's expressed intent to target the industry and his actions to evade law enforcement after the murder. The judge warned lawyers to refrain from public commentary that could impede Mangione's right to a fair trial.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to over seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Judge Joanna Seybert expressed disappointment in Santos' repeated lies and lack of remorse, while acknowledging his talents and potential future contributions to society. Santos tearfully apologized for betraying his supporters and undermining faith in the institutions he swore to uphold, but prosecutors argued he showed little contrition and blamed the Justice Department. The case involved Santos falsifying Federal Election Commission filings and fabricating donor contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration abruptly reversed its decision to cancel over 1,500 student visas held by international students.

This decision came after a wave of lawsuits from students who had their legal right to study in the U.S. rescinded, often with little explanation.

Dugan reportedly misdirected federal agents and escorted Flores-Ruiz through a non-public area of the courthouse.

          <p>Two recently published books, Charlotte Beradt's "Third Reich of Dreams" and Laila Lalami's novel "The Dream Hotel," connect dream behavior to real-world implications. Beradt's book documents the dreams of Germans during Hitler's rise, revealing the Nazis' influence on the subconscious. Lalami's novel imagines a dystopian state monitoring dreams, incarcerating those deemed likely to commit crimes. Both works suggest that dreams, though beyond conscious control, may be our purest expressions of free will, offering insights into subtle changes in life and the impact of nascent authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Angeline Murimirwa, now the CEO of CAMFED (Campaign for Female Education), has been named one of Time's most influential people. CAMFED provides scholarships to girls in Africa to complete their education, and Murimirwa herself was a recipient. Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai highlighted Murimirwa's tenacity in fighting for girls' education. Murimirwa's personal story involves hiding in the bathroom to avoid school inspectors due to her family's inability to afford school fees, underscoring the challenges many girls face in accessing education.</p>

Mexico's free trade agreement with the U.S. exempts some imports from tariffs, giving it an advantage. The U.S. president has imposed a 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods.</p>
