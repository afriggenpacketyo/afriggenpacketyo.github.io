          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to implement a trade deal with Japan, setting baseline tariffs at 15% on most Japanese goods, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan will invest $550 billion in U.S. projects and increase purchases of American agricultural products and commercial aircraft. The deal comes as Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba faces mounting political pressure at home due to recent election losses and internal party discontent over inflation-taming measures and previous scandals. Analysts suggest Ishiba is unlikely to survive a leadership challenge, potentially resigning before an election amid growing internal opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

He has submitted photo ID, credit cards, and images of his face to prove his identity, noting his middle name is Steven, while the Facebook founder's middle name is Elliot.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion after no one won the top prize in the recent drawing, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history. The article analyzes Powerball data to determine which states offer the highest and lowest after-tax payouts, considering both annuity and lump-sum options. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to receive larger sums compared to states with higher tax rates like Minnesota, Oregon, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and New York. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, and the next drawing marks a record for consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Reportedly Plans to Rename Defense Department as Department of War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 22:18:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly planning to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, reverting to a name used until after World War II. The order would allow Defense Department officials to use the title Secretary of War, and the White House says the name Department of War will serve as a secondary title for the Department of Defense. Trump has previously stated that War Department "just sounded better" to him, though it is unclear if the change can be officially made without congressional approval. The change could be costly, as renaming nine Army bases was previously estimated to cost $39 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, viewing it as a reflection of his and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's preference for a more aggressive stance. The author argues that the change is unnecessary, as the Department of Defense was created in 1949 to reflect the ongoing need for national security, not just wartime militarization. The article highlights that even countries like China and Russia use the term "defense" for their military organizations. The author emphasizes that the name change is a superficial move that does not address the real issues facing the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>President Trump will speak at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., during a Religious Liberty Commission hearing on religious freedom in education. The commission, created by Trump, aims to protect Americans' ability to practice their religion freely, especially in public education, and address perceived threats to First Amendment protections. Parents and students are expected to share experiences of expressing their faith in public schools, with Attorney General Pam Bondi also scheduled to speak. The White House stated that the previous administration abused its power to interfere with religious freedom, particularly targeting Christians, and that Trump is the greatest defender of faith in modern history.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, after lower courts ordered her reinstatement. The White House asserts Trump acted lawfully in removing Slaughter, citing the President's authority to remove heads of executive agencies. Slaughter was removed in March, along with another Democratic commissioner, as part of an effort to exert influence over federal agencies. Slaughter maintains she intends to serve her term, which ends in 2029, and is focused on her work at the FTC, despite the ongoing legal challenge.</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, was convicted of murder in the killing of her former son-in-law, Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel. Markel was gunned down in 2014 amid a bitter custody battle with Adelson's daughter, Wendi Adelson. Prosecutors argued that Donna Adelson orchestrated Markel's killing to allow her daughter and grandchildren to move closer to the rest of her family. Adelson was the fifth person tried in connection with the murder-for-hire plot, with her son, Charles Adelson, already serving a life sentence.</p>

Despite the increase in prevalence, about a quarter of people wish they hadn't gotten at least one tattoo. A recent exhibit featured the work of 33 Michigan tattoo artists, highlighting the art form's push for acceptance.</p>
