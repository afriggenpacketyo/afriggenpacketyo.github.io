          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' shares climbed by approximately 5% following the announcement of a limited-edition collaboration with football star Travis Kelce. This strategic partnership, which was over a year in development, capitalized on the immense public interest generated by Kelce's recent engagement to Taylor Swift, which also briefly impacted other related stocks. The "AE x TK" collection introduces vintage-inspired T-shirts and reimagined varsity jackets, blending the brand's style with Kelce's picks. This move highlights the company's approach to leveraging celebrity endorsements to drive market engagement and sales, building on past high-profile campaigns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, even as its overall sales declined. The company also tightened its full-year sales guidance, indicating a more optimistic outlook, and revised its adjusted earnings per share forecast upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged economic pressures on lower and middle-income customers but highlighted ongoing initiatives to revitalize the brand, such as reintroducing petite sections, bringing back jewelry, and refining discount strategies. Despite recent leadership changes and past struggles, these financial results suggest the company is making tangible progress in its efforts to return to growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Patients relying on the weight-loss drug Mounjaro are struggling to obtain their medication, a situation exacerbated by surging demand ahead of a substantial price increase from manufacturer Eli Lilly, effective September 1. Eli Lilly has issued warnings against "inappropriate stockpiling" and instructed UK distributors to cease taking new pharmacy orders from today, with pharmacies prioritizing existing users. The planned price hike, which could see costs rise by up to 170%, has generated significant apprehension among both patients and pharmacists. While supplies are anticipated to stabilize after September 1, this issue underscores broader concerns about drug accessibility and affordability in the healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below are implementing diverse strategies to counteract the effects of new tariffs, tailored to their specific product categories and customer demographics. Abercrombie & Fitch has significantly diversified its global supply chain to lessen its tariff burden, while Best Buy engaged in front-loading shipments earlier in the year. Five Below, despite high exposure to Chinese tariffs, benefits from its flexible inventory model, allowing for opportunistic purchasing. Industry experts predict tariffs will become a more significant headwind in the second half of the year, with larger, food-centric retailers better equipped to absorb costs than those focused on general merchandise.

          <p>US President Donald Trump has enacted a comprehensive program of tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, asserting that they bolster American manufacturing, safeguard jobs, and narrow the trade deficit. These duties, applied at varying rates to specific products and countries, have introduced volatility into the global economy and prompted some businesses to increase prices for US consumers. Although a US trade court questioned the president's authority on certain tariffs, an appeals court permitted their continuation.

          <p>India is facing substantial economic repercussions as US President Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on various Indian goods, including a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia, have now been implemented. These severe duties, estimated to affect $48.2 billion worth of exports, risk rendering shipments commercially unviable, potentially causing job losses and decelerating economic growth in India's primary export market. In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to safeguard Indian interests, advocating for self-reliance and announcing forthcoming tax cuts and reforms to stimulate domestic consumption. India is also actively exploring new export markets to reduce its dependence on the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington, D.C., crime data reveals a nearly 50% decrease in violent crime during the three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement, compared to the same period last year. The data also shows significant drops in burglaries and car thefts. Although crime rates were already on a downward trend, the analysis indicates that federal deployments were strategically concentrated in areas with historically higher crime rates. The White House reported over 1,094 arrests and 115 firearms seized, but local leaders, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have raised concerns about the extensive National Guard presence, citing potential community fear and disruption.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares climbed approximately 7% after the company announced its decision to revert to its original logo, abandoning a recent controversial redesign. This reversal followed significant public backlash on social media and direct criticism from President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the company to reinstate its traditional branding. The proposed new logo, which eliminated the familiar "Uncle Herschel" character and the "Old Country Store" phrase, was widely perceived as "generic" and sparked accusations of the brand going "woke" from conservative critics. Cracker Barrel expressed gratitude for customer feedback, reaffirming its dedication to its established values and country hospitality.</p>

While its English-dubbed re-release in the US had limited success, an earlier subtitled version performed strongly, indicating an audience for the original. The article attributes this triumph to the film being an epic sequel featuring maximalist, visually stunning animation and a universally relatable coming-of-age narrative.

Governor Gavin Newsom advocated for the program's expansion to counteract "runaway production" and solidify California's standing as the global entertainment hub, making the state more competitive through broadened eligibility and increased credit percentages.</p>

While some interventions were made, including daily bag checks and counseling offers, the review identified missed opportunities for early help assessments and improved inter-agency communication.

The article emphasizes how Toews, renowned for incorporating her biography into her fiction, explores the ineffable nature of these losses, framing writing not as a means of redemption but as a vital way of coexisting with tragedy. Inspired by Christian Wiman's concept of a "truce that is not peace," Toews reflects on how her inexorable urge to write, initially perceived as a counter to her family's silence, ultimately became a profound method of preserving their memory and sustaining her own existence.</p>
