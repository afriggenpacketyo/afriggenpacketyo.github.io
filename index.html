          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly approved a nonbinding resolution endorsing a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a vote of 142-10. The resolution, sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, calls for a phased plan to end the conflict and urges the recognition of a Palestinian state. The United States and Israel were among the few nations to vote against the measure, with the Israeli ambassador dismissing it as "theater" that benefits Hamas. The resolution also includes a rare condemnation of Hamas by Arab nations for the October 7 attacks while also condemning Israel's military actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to fine Boeing $3.1 million for numerous safety and quality control violations identified between September 2023 and February 2024. The proposed penalty covers lapses related to the January incident where a door plug blew out mid-flight on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9. An FAA investigation found hundreds of violations at Boeing's and subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems' factories, including an instance of an employee pressuring an inspector to approve an aircraft to meet delivery schedules. Boeing has acknowledged the proposed penalty and stated it is committed to strengthening its safety culture and quality assurance processes.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. The suspect was apprehended after his father recognized him from police photos and facilitated his surrender. Investigators believe Robinson acted alone in what they term a "targeted attack," having tracked his movements on campus and recovered the high-powered rifle allegedly used. The case has drawn national attention, with officials treating it as a political assassination and reviewing messages and inscriptions on bullet casings for a potential motive.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed several controversial bills aimed at transforming the student experience, which now await Governor Gavin Newsom's approval. One major bill mandates a phonics-based "science of reading" approach to address lagging literacy scores, moving away from other teaching methods. Another measure seeks to phase out ultra-processed foods like chicken nuggets and corn dogs from school cafeterias to improve student health. A third bill, AB 715, establishes a state Office for Civil Rights to combat discrimination in schools, with specific coordinators for issues like antisemitism, after concerns were raised over ethnic studies curricula.</p>

          <p>Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil has disclosed that he suffered a severe stroke last Christmas, which resulted in the paralysis of his entire left side. The health crisis was so serious that his doctors initially doubted he would be able to walk or perform on stage again. Neil explained that he had to undergo intensive physical therapy, progressing from being carried to using a wheelchair, a walker, and a cane.

          <p>A large-scale rally in central London, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, attracted an estimated 110,000 participants, according to police. The "Unite the Kingdom" march focused on anti-immigration and free speech themes, featuring speakers like Elon Musk via video link. A counter-protest organized by Stand Up To Racism drew about 5,000 people, with speakers including MP Diane Abbott condemning the far-right message. The Metropolitan Police deployed around 1,500 officers to manage the demonstrations, which saw episodes of violence, including protesters throwing projectiles and assaulting officers as they tried to breach police cordons.</p>

This move marks an escalation of the president's use of troops for domestic law enforcement, following a similar deployment in Washington D.C.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer personally questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US. According to reports, after initial vetting flagged the relationship, Starmer sent three specific questions regarding Mandelson's continued contact with Epstein post-conviction and a reported stay at his home. Mandelson was dismissed from the post this week after newly surfaced emails showed him sending supportive messages to Epstein in 2008. Downing Street sources suggest Mandelson was "economical with the truth" in his responses, leading to increased scrutiny of the prime minister's judgment.</p>

However, a coalition of eight parties, including the Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre, has argued the president's action was unconstitutional.

          <h2>Loan Documents Show Fed Governor Lisa Cook Labeled Property a 'Vacation Home,' Contradicting Trump's Fraud Claims</h2>

          <p>Documents reveal that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described a condominium she purchased in 2021 as a "vacation home" and a "second home" on different forms. This characterization could weaken the Trump administration's claims that she committed mortgage fraud by allegedly declaring two properties as primary residences simultaneously. President Trump has sought to fire Cook based on these allegations in an effort to reshape the Fed's board. Cook has sued to block her removal and obtained an injunction, though the administration is appealing the ruling ahead of the Fed's next interest rate meeting.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has denied any knowledge of a controversial $28 million endorsement deal between star player Kawhi Leonard and Aspiration, a now-bankrupt company in which Ballmer was an investor. The deal is at the center of an NBA investigation into whether it was a "no-show" arrangement designed to circumvent the league's salary cap. Ballmer admitted to introducing Leonard's representatives to Aspiration but insisted he was not involved in their negotiations and was unaware of the contract's details. He stated that the company, whose co-founder has pleaded guilty to fraud, had "conned" him as well.</p>

          <p>A couple who left their New York City lives for two years to live nomadically in ten different cities reflects on the positive impacts of the experience. By selling 90% of their belongings, they learned to value experiences over possessions and became minimalists, a practice they continue today. The constant change forced them to break out of monotonous routines, try new things, and explore different parts of the country. They also found that by sharing short-term rentals and shopping less, they saved money, which allowed them to afford a better apartment upon returning to Brooklyn to start a family.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County judge has dismissed the sweeping RICO conspiracy charges against 61 individuals protesting the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state attorney general's office lacked the authority to bring the case after local district attorneys had declined to prosecute, a significant blow to the state's two-year effort. This decision effectively collapses the core of the state's controversial indictment, which sought to frame the protest movement as an organized criminal enterprise. The state has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which experts are calling a major failure in prosecuting a protest movement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical professor of dermatology is advising consumers to prioritize ingredients over brand names when selecting lip oils, amid social media reports of hyperpigmentation. The thin skin on lips is more susceptible to sun damage, and oils without SPF can magnify UV exposure, potentially leading to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, especially in people of color. Irritating ingredients used for plumping effects, as well as common fragrances like peppermint and citrus, can also cause dermatitis. For safer use, consumers should look for products with broad-spectrum SPF and hydrating components like hyaluronic acid while avoiding fragrances and certain oleic acids.</p>

          <p>The first flights returning migrants from the United Kingdom to France under a new bilateral agreement are anticipated to begin next week.

In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers directly from France who pass security checks. Formal removal directions have reportedly been issued to dozens of migrants detained in Dover last month, marking the start of the trial phase of the Labour government's plan to address small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his readiness to impose "major sanctions" on Russia, but only on the condition that all NATO member nations also implement sanctions and completely cease purchasing Russian oil. In a social media post, he criticized the alliance for a lack of commitment to ending the war in Ukraine, calling it "shocking" that some members, like Turkey and Hungary, continue to buy Russian energy. Trump also suggested that NATO could help end the conflict by collectively imposing tariffs of 50% to 100% on China for its continued purchases of Russian petroleum.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football program is in crisis after a humiliating 35-10 loss to New Mexico, dropping the team to an 0-3 record for the season. The performance has intensified pressure on second-year coach DeShaun Foster, with critics pointing to a lack of discipline, evidenced by 13 penalties, and a porous run defense that allowed 298 rushing yards. Foster expressed confidence in his ability to turn the season around, but the team has yet to hold a lead in any game this year. The disastrous start has also brought scrutiny upon Athletic Director Martin Jarmond, who hired the inexperienced Foster.</p>
