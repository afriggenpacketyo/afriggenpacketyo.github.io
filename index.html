          <p>Former President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of love and support they have received following the announcement of Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis. The couple acknowledged that "cancer touches us all" and emphasized their strength in the face of adversity. Biden's office revealed that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, but is hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. They are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians, as reactions from officials across the political spectrum have poured in, offering well wishes and hope for his recovery.</p>

          <p>Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic indicated he is currently inclined to support only one interest rate cut this year, as the central bank navigates potential inflationary pressures and recession concerns. Bostic noted that tariffs have been larger than the Fed anticipated, which may delay the process. He expressed concerns about rising inflation expectations, stating that it could complicate the Fed's job. Bostic emphasized his focus on maintaining stable prices, given the troubling movement in inflation expectations, but Bostic is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a landmark agreement aimed at bolstering security cooperation and reducing trade barriers implemented after Brexit, signaling a "reset" in relations. The deal includes provisions for easier border crossings for British citizens using electronic gates in Europe, simplified pet travel, and the resumption of some British meat product sales in the EU. A contentious issue was resolved by extending fishing rights for European trawlers in UK waters until June 30, 2038, and the agreement also encompasses plans for a youth program to facilitate travel and work exchanges. This NYTimes article highlights the political sensitivity of the deal for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who hopes the tangible benefits for consumers and travelers will outweigh criticism from Brexit supporters.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism after stating that he does not need to buy rice because he receives ample amounts from supporters, at a time when rice prices are soaring. Eto's comments, made at a fundraising party, came as the ministry planned to release rice from emergency stockpiles to curb prices, which have doubled due to a poor harvest. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba summoned Eto and urged him to retract the remarks, but allowed him to remain in his position to address the burden of rising rice prices on households. The government has faced criticism for its delayed response in releasing stockpiled rice, and rising rice prices have exacerbated the financial strain on consumers.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has directed state institutions and ministries to increase their purchases of domestically produced electric vehicles (EVs) as part of an effort to promote environmentally friendly automobiles for official use. While no specific targets were mentioned, the move signals the government's support for home-made EVs and could influence broader adoption. However, analysts suggest that the impact on the industry may be limited, as official procurement represents a relatively small share of the national market. Beijing has been promoting EV purchases by state institutions since 2017, and the Ministry of Finance previously mandated that EVs constitute at least 30% of annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities.</p>

The bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted. The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. This BBC article states that while it was "a step in the right direction", prices were not falling enough for those households still struggling with cost of living, and bills "remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade".</p>

          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that domestic energy prices in the UK will decrease in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. The bill for a typical household using gas and electricity is expected to fall by £129 annually, a nearly 7% decrease. Despite this positive development, analysts caution that prices remain significantly higher than levels seen earlier in the decade, potentially leaving many households struggling with affordability. This BBC article highlights the mixed outlook for UK energy consumers, with some relief on the horizon but ongoing concerns about the cost of living.</p>
