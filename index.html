          <p>BP's stock experienced volatility following a Wall Street Journal report suggesting Shell was considering acquiring BP. Shares initially surged by over 10% before retracting after Shell denied any ongoing discussions. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that a complete acquisition of BP by Shell is unlikely; a split and sale to multiple companies would be a more probable scenario. BP's recent underperformance compared to Shell and other U.S. rivals has fueled speculation about its vulnerability as an acquisition target, especially after a strategic reset that increased focus on oil and gas.

          <p>This article discusses the potential interest earnings from depositing $20,000 into a 2-year certificate of deposit (CD) account, emphasizing the trade-off between accessibility and returns. With online banks offering rates comfortably over 4%, savers can earn significant interest, but they must keep their money untouched for the full term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. The article provides specific examples of potential earnings at different interest rates, such as earning over $1,600 with a 2-year CD at 4.10%. Given the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the article advises savers to act proactively to secure high rates while they are available. (not investment advice)</p>

Rieder also believes the U.S. economy is unlikely to enter a recession due to its reliance on services rather than cyclical goods.

Trump maintained that the Iranian nuclear program had been "obliterated," contradicting the report's finding that the strikes likely set the program back by only a few months. He acknowledged the existence of the Defense Intelligence Agency's report but argued that its data was insufficient and that news outlets ignored the assessment's mention of "very severe" damage.

          <p>The Federal Reserve proposed easing a key capital rule for large Wall Street banks, a move intended to enhance Treasury market liquidity but met with dissent from some officials. The proposal aims to reduce the top-tier capital big banks must hold, potentially freeing up capital for lower-risk assets like Treasurys. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated the current leverage ratio has become too binding, while officials like Michelle Bowman supported the changes to build resilience in Treasury markets. However, governors Adriana Kugler and Michael Barr opposed the move, suggesting banks would likely use the freed-up capital for shareholder distributions rather than Treasury intermediation.

          <p>This article explores whether a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) will be cheaper this summer, considering potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. As of late June, interest rates for both products are similar, but the fixed-rate nature of home equity loans versus the variable rates of HELOCs could influence affordability. The article suggests that while home equity loans may offer a lower initial rate, HELOCs could become cheaper if rates decrease later in the summer.
