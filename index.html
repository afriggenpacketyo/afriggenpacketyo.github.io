            <p>A 38-year-old man, Cody Balmer, has been arrested for allegedly setting fire to the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were inside. The family was safely evacuated, and no injuries were reported, although the fire caused significant damage. Balmer faces charges including attempted murder and terrorism, with authorities investigating the motive behind the targeted attack. The incident occurred on the first night of Passover, prompting an investigation into whether Shapiro's Jewish faith played a role, though Shapiro has stated he will not be deterred from celebrating his faith. </p>

            <p>Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's bid to acquire Royal Mail's parent company has been cleared by the UK government after legally binding undertakings. Royal Mail, founded in 1516, has struggled with financial losses, declining letter volumes, and labor disputes, but Kretinsky aims to transform it into a pan-European logistics giant. He also sees potential in Royal Mail's European parcel business, GLS, and plans to invest in technology and out-of-home delivery solutions to compete with rivals like Amazon and DHL.
