          <p>Bitcoin has shown resilience by increasing for a second consecutive day, testing a key resistance level of $88,000. This movement coincides with a sell-off in the U.S. equities market, fueled by President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates. Bitcoin's decoupling from traditional risk assets is evident, with U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin seeing significant inflows. Analysts suggest that while the decoupling is encouraging, breaking above the $93,000 resistance level will require a substantial catalyst. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India and the US are reportedly making progress in bilateral trade negotiations, as indicated after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice-President JD Vance in Delhi. The discussion comes during President Trump's 90-day pause on higher tariffs, set to end on July 9, with India potentially facing a 27% tariff before the pause. Despite a warm relationship between Modi and Trump, the US has expressed concerns about the lack of reciprocity in trade relations with India, particularly in sectors like agriculture. The leaders also discussed cooperation in defense, strategic technologies, and energy.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. and global economies, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs and the resulting uncertainty. Global growth is now projected at 2.8% for this year and 3% for next year, while U.S. growth is expected to be just 1.8% this year. The IMF anticipates a "supply shock" in the U.S. and reduced demand in China, with inflation likely to worsen in the U.S. The uncertainty surrounding future trade policies is expected to weigh heavily on economic activity.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly reduced its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, attributing the downgrade to the impact of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. These tariffs have not only negatively affected the stock market but have also prompted countermeasures from trading partners. The IMF also revised its global growth forecast downward to 2.8%, citing the negative supply shock caused by the tariffs. The report also indicates higher inflation forecasts for advanced economies, including the U.S., due to the tariffs and stubborn price dynamics in the services sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Apple, and Cra-Z-Art are making significant investments in U.S. facilities.

          <p>Gold prices are currently at $3,441.13 per ounce, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge.

          <p>Gold prices have risen, surpassing $3,500 an ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid concerns about the global trade war and President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve.

Gold is viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, with central banks adding to their gold reserves.

          <p>A Japanese court has ruled that a low-cost airline, Jetstar Japan Co., must pay damages and grant its cabin crew mandated breaks during flights. The court found that the lack of rest periods violated the country's labor laws, citing the high level of psychological and physical stress during flights. The airline argued that crew rests allowed for breaks, but the court determined that these did not qualify as breaks since attendants remained responsible for passenger safety and cabin duties.

Observers suggest that this rhetoric is a call to Hong Kong officials and businesses to unite with Beijing in the ongoing trade war with the US.

          <p>Chinese shipyards are experiencing relief as the U.S. has scaled back its proposed port-fee plan, which initially aimed to charge Chinese-linked ships entering American ports. The final plan includes a phased fee structure with several exemptions, reducing pressure on Chinese shipbuilders. The most significant change is the removal of a clause that would have charged shipping companies based on the number of Chinese-made vessels in their fleets, alleviating concerns about placing orders with Chinese shipbuilders. This adjustment shifts the burden more towards major shipping carriers.</p>

One option is for Beijing to publicly invite the US to negotiate in China, or a neutral third party could broker a meeting on the sidelines of a regional summit.
