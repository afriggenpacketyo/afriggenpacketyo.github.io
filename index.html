          <h2>East German Toy 'Tiemi' Gains Collector Interest Amid Modern Collectible Craze</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the Tiemi, an East German version of the popular 1980s Monchhichi doll. Created in the German Democratic Republic as an alternative to the Western toy, the Tiemi was produced in the toy-making town of Sonneberg and became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc. Following German reunification, production ceased, turning these dolls into sought-after collector's items. The piece draws a parallel to the current craze for collectibles like Labubu, highlighting a cycle of nostalgia and the value placed on authenticity and historical uniqueness in the toy market.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British bank Barclays reported second-quarter pre-tax profits of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations and prompting the announcement of a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by a 10% year-on-year income increase in its investment banking division, which benefited from market volatility and robust trading income. Despite challenges like a drop in advisory fees and looming US capital rule changes, the bank affirmed it is on track with its three-year strategic plan to deliver higher returns. The results reflect a broader trend of banks posting strong earnings amid recent market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fans of Ozzy Osbourne will have an opportunity to pay their final respects as a funeral cortege for the late Black Sabbath singer travels through his hometown of Birmingham. The procession is scheduled to move along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge, a site that has become a memorial with numerous fan tributes. The city's Lord Mayor praised Osbourne, who died at 76, as a "son of Birmingham" who brought global recognition to the city. The event, funded by the Osbourne family, will involve street closures to accommodate the public tribute to the heavy metal icon.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets to reinforce their striking options, though any move depends on the club offloading other players first. Acquiring either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reportedly unwilling to sell Watkins and has placed a high price tag on him, while Newcastle is also competing for Sesko. The club acknowledges the need to sell players to fund new acquisitions, a process that may extend until the transfer deadline. United is weighing its options carefully amid these market complexities.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are urging Beijing to actively shape its international narrative by leveraging new cultural symbols and engaging more with scholars across Asia. The goal is to create a discourse that reflects Asian values, such as "harmony and diversity," to counterbalance the long-standing dominance of Western perspectives in global communication. Experts suggest that as US global engagement shifts, China has an opportunity to take a leading role in defining international norms, particularly in emerging fields. This strategy aims to align China's soft power with its economic growth and increase its influence within the Global South and Brics bloc.</p>

The surge is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to increase iPhone production in India, with total Indian-made smartphone shipments to the U.S. soaring by 240%.

The significant drop was attributed to lower interest income and, notably, a share of losses from its associate, Air India. The airline's stake in the recently restructured Air India has become a drag on its bottom line, with analysts noting that Air India's losses were deeper than expected. While the company stated that demand for air travel remains strong, its operating profit also declined, signaling that margins are normalizing from pandemic-era highs amid rising competition.

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, a decision that could reshape the legacy of the nation's most influential modern leader. The court found evidence that Uribe conspired to pressure imprisoned former paramilitary members to change their testimony regarding his alleged links to these groups. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, remains a deeply polarizing figure, credited by supporters for stabilizing the country but accused by critics of human rights abuses. He faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal the historic verdict.</p>

          <p>In his first phone call with his new South Korean counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi encouraged Seoul to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable China policy from South Korea's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung. The call, which lasted about 45 minutes, signals Beijing's effort to reset and improve relations that had become strained under the previous, more US-aligned government. Both ministers reportedly agreed to advance their strategic partnership and work towards tangible outcomes, reflecting a potential thaw in diplomatic ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The policy will provide families with 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a move expected to benefit approximately 20 million families. This national scheme follows various pilot programs by local governments aimed at encouraging more births. The initiative addresses the high cost of raising children in China, which is a significant factor in the country's shrinking and rapidly aging population, even after the one-child policy was abolished.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to block a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for most immigrants arrested by ICE, regardless of their ties to the community or risk level. This policy reverses the long-standing practice of allowing bond hearings for individuals not deemed a flight or safety risk. Immigrant rights groups argue the new interpretation of the law is a violation of due process and is causing "catastrophic" harm by separating families and detaining people for months or years. The lawsuit names plaintiffs including a single mother and cancer survivor who is the sole provider for her two U.S. citizen children.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is facing significant public pressure to take a tougher stance on Israel regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with a new survey showing 74% of Germans support such a move. Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II to discuss regional developments and a potential German-Jordanian airlift to deliver aid into the besieged enclave. While Germany remains one of Israel's strongest allies, the poll reveals a widespread desire across political affiliations for more action to alleviate civilian suffering.

According to the Financial Times, Washington informed Lai he could not stop in New York, while other reports indicate the trip was merely delayed, with potential stops in Texas. Taiwan's Presidential Office cited domestic typhoon recovery efforts and regional developments as reasons for the change in travel plans. The decision is significant as such "stopovers" are often viewed by Beijing as a provocation, and avoiding one could pave the way for a potential meeting between Presidents Xi and Trump.</p>

Desperation is so high that displaced Gazans are resorting to "self-distribution" by taking supplies directly from convoys.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming the right of federal employees to express their religious beliefs in the workplace, including discussing their faith and attempting to persuade colleagues. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can display religious items, invite coworkers to church, and engage in polite religious discussions, provided they stop if asked. While building on previous policy, critics like the Freedom From Religion Foundation argue the guidance is unconstitutional and encourages proselytizing, potentially allowing supervisors to evangelize subordinates. This move is part of a broader administration push to protect and promote religious expression within the federal government.</p>
