          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, currently in Finland, clarified Germany's stance on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons against Russia, stating that it is permitted. He also suggested Vatican mediation in the Ukraine war, adding that Russia's rejection would signal a lack of interest in peace. Merz criticized Israel's recent military actions in Gaza as seemingly disproportionate to fighting Hamas or defending Israel. In Germany, the trial began for a suspect in the Solingen terrorist attack from last August, marking a significant event in German legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Kim Jong-un's decision to skip Russia's Victory Day parade signals a complex diplomatic strategy. Despite efforts to strengthen ties with Moscow and provide support in the Ukraine conflict, Kim's absence avoids potential awkwardness with China, which is uneasy about Pyongyang's alignment with Russia. By not attending, Kim also sidestepped public alignment with Putin, which could strain relations with Beijing, as Xi Jinping was the main guest. Instead, Kim visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, emphasizing the "blood-sealed" alliance with Russia in a speech.</p>

This news comes after Uchida's departure following unsuccessful merger talks with Honda and amidst company plans to cut thousands of jobs due to a net loss. The large payouts may draw criticism from investors at the upcoming shareholders' meeting. Nissan is currently working to streamline its global operations under new leadership to restore profitability, including doubling staff cuts and closing several vehicle plants.</p>

This incident highlights the increasing human-animal encounters in Japan, where bear attacks have reached record levels due to climate change affecting food sources and depopulation leading bears into towns more frequently.

          <p>The UK government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, which restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has increased poverty but cautioned that reversing it would be expensive. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of its child poverty strategy. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would not have introduced the cap and that the cost of inaction is also significant.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities and increasing competition. Despite overall battery electric car sales rising in Europe, Tesla's sales have tanked nearly 40% over the January-April period. The company's aging car lineup and the lack of new mass-market offerings have also contributed to its struggles. Additionally, Tesla faces increasing competition from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players, with BYD surpassing Tesla in pure electric car sales in Europe for the first time.</p>

          <p>China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a drop in overall greenhouse gas emissions for the first time, even as energy demand increased. This decline is largely attributed to the country’s aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, which outpaced electricity demand growth. The shift puts China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets, as it had committed to peaking emissions before 2030. China's role as a major producer of clean energy technologies also benefits developing countries, but the sustainability of this decline depends on economic growth and trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Politicians are trying to boost manufacturing, prompting an examination of whether these jobs are truly special. Economists debate if romanticizing this sector is rational, with some citing nostalgia over practical benefits for workers and the economy. Research indicates that manufacturing jobs still offer a wage premium, especially for those without a college education, though this premium varies by subsector. Factors contributing to this premium include a history of unionization, the handling of expensive machinery, and potentially unpleasant working conditions, but the industry may also offer opportunities to those without college degrees.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Vladimir Putin of "playing games" with US-brokered peace talks, citing increasingly brazen and large-scale Russian strikes. Zelenskyy urged the US and other nations to impose new and stronger sanctions against Russia to force a ceasefire and respect for diplomacy. He framed Putin as the primary obstacle to a peace deal amidst ongoing drone strikes and a fractious relationship with the Trump administration. The Ukrainian president is seeking a 30-day ceasefire for peace talks, but Russia has so far refused the proposal.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal Russia is constructing power lines in occupied southeastern Ukraine to connect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to its grid, according to a Greenpeace report. This suggests Moscow intends to restart and utilize the plant despite risks and international calls to address its status in peace talks. The construction includes over 50 miles of electricity lines and pylons between Mariupol and Berdyansk. Experts warn against restarting the plant under current conditions and note that Russia would need to build more lines to fully connect the plant to its own grid.</p>

          <p>A growing political divide between young men and women is attributed to economic shifts over the past half-century. Younger men are increasingly supporting right-wing parties due to factors like job insecurity and declining manufacturing, which have worsened their economic prospects and shifted social roles. This has led to lower social trust and more regressive gender norms among men. Traditional gender roles and economic opportunities have provided women with more avenues for personal satisfaction, while men have struggled to adapt to a changing economy.</p>
