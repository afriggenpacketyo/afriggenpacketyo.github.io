            <p>Three Indian and two Chinese students have initiated legal action against the Trump administration, challenging the termination of their F1 visas. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, alleges that the government's actions threaten students with deportation and financial hardship, without providing adequate notice. The students, including Hangrui Zhang, Haoyang An, Linkhith Babu Gorrela, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli, and Manikanta Pasula, face academic and financial setbacks due to the visa revocations, as many international students have expressed concerns about the tightening of student visa policies by the Trump administration. The lawsuit highlights the significant impact on Chinese and Indian students, who constitute a substantial portion of international students in the United States.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported ongoing Russian military actions, including shellings and assaults, despite President Vladimir Putin's announced Easter truce. Zelenskyy stated that Russia is creating an 'impression' of a ceasefire while still attempting to advance in certain areas. While the front lines were quieter, Zelenskyy accused Moscow of specific military actions and reiterated Ukraine's readiness to mirror a full and unconditional cessation of hostilities. Zelenskyy also expressed openness to extending the truce beyond the proposed 30-hour period, referencing a prior U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.</p>

            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Donald Trump's demands for Harvard University to reorganize its governance and hire faculty to ensure "viewpoint diversity" are a form of political bullying that undermines academic freedom. Malik contends that while viewpoint diversity is important, Trump's approach, which essentially calls for affirmative action for conservatives, is a pernicious form of identity politics. He suggests that fostering a richer culture of debate requires rethinking social and political engagement and encouraging the capacity to consider different perspectives, rather than imposing state mandates or bureaucratic procedures.</p>

However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, stating that if Russia is genuinely ready for a full ceasefire, Ukraine would mirror that approach and strike only in defense. Zelenskyy noted that Russian assaults and artillery fire continued along parts of the front line, casting doubt on the sincerity of the truce.
