          <p>The annual Medicare open enrollment period, running from October 15 to December 7, is proceeding despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. Experts advise beneficiaries to review their options for 2026 but suggest waiting to finalize decisions until the government reopens, as access to information and support from services like the 1-800-Medicare hotline may be delayed. This period allows individuals to switch between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans or update their Part D prescription drug coverage, making it a crucial time to evaluate costs and benefits.</p>

          <p>China's Minister of Transport, Liu Wei, has called upon the international shipping industry to unite against what he termed US "unilateralism and protectionism." The statement follows the US administration's decision to impose significant port fees on Chinese-operated vessels, a move that prompted Beijing to enact retaliatory fees on US ships. Liu's remarks underscore escalating trade tensions between the two nations, which threaten to disrupt global supply chains and the broader world economy.</p>

          <p>Two retired FBI agents involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing investigation have condemned New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for campaigning with Imam Siraj Wahhaj. Wahhaj was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 attack and has a history of defending convicted terrorists. The agents described Mamdani's association with the controversial cleric as "foolish" and ignorant of history, sparking broader concerns among some moderate Muslims about the candidate's judgment and allegiances.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor reports on the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski, a case that led her back to her small Pennsylvania hometown. The investigation revealed a personal connection, as the victim's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, was a former high school classmate of the reporter. Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was convicted of the murder, but questions surrounding Snyder's potential involvement linger, especially after she invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during his trial.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close on Sunday after a robbery occurred shortly after its opening. According to French ministers, several suspects entered the Apollon Gallery and stole jewelry of "inestimable" heritage and historical value. The suspects reportedly used a construction ladder to gain access and fled the scene on motorcycles in an operation that lasted only about seven minutes. An investigation is currently underway, and no injuries were reported during the incident.</p>

While she remains aligned with Trump, her willingness to dissent on specific policies suggests a more complex political strategy and challenges the idea of a monolithic MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>The technological competition between the United States and China has evolved from a series of disputes into a systemic and enduring feature of the global order. Each nation is leveraging its distinct advantages—China's dominance in rare earth mineral processing and the US's control over foundational software, semiconductors, and financial systems. This tit-for-tat escalation is fundamentally reshaping international tech supply chains and standards, creating a new and challenging geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces have reportedly launched a drone attack on a significant gas processing plant deep inside Russia, in the Orenburg region, approximately 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The strike caused a fire and damaged the facility, which is one of the world's largest of its kind. This attack represents a continuation of Ukraine's strategy to target Russia's energy infrastructure, aiming to disrupt its fuel supply and reduce the revenue funding Moscow's war effort.</p>

The Chinese division of the chipmaker declared itself an "independent" entity in a public letter, escalating a power struggle between the company's Chinese owner, Wingtech Technology, and Dutch authorities. This move effectively severs the Chinese operations from the parent company's control, creating significant uncertainty for the global semiconductor firm.</p>

          <p>A nine-year investigation, significantly aided by secret filming from a BBC Scotland documentary, has resulted in the conviction of 14 individuals in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The company, Sell My Timeshare, targeted over 3,500 elderly victims who were desperate to exit their timeshare contracts, using high-pressure tactics to sell them worthless credits instead. The scheme's ringleader, Mark Rowe, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for his role in the conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, co-founder of the betting giant Betfred, has warned that a proposed tax hike on the gambling industry could force the closure of all 1,287 of its high street shops in the UK. Such a move would jeopardize approximately 7,500 jobs. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves signals that gambling firms should pay a fairer share of taxes, with some proposals suggesting a significant increase that industry leaders claim would make their retail operations unprofitable and drive betting to offshore markets.</p>
