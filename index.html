          <p>Meta Platforms has announced it will not sign the European Union's new voluntary AI code of practice, which is set to take effect next month. Joel Kaplan, the company's global affairs chief, argued that the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the EU's AI Act, potentially stifling innovation for AI developers in Europe. This decision places Meta in opposition to companies like OpenAI, which has committed to the code, but aligns it with others like ASML and Airbus that have also voiced concerns about the regulations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics fell sharply after reports that the Food and Drug Administration is considering asking the company to halt shipments of its gene therapy, Elevidys. The FDA's review follows two patient deaths linked to the treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a severe muscle-wasting disease. The drug has faced controversy since its approval, with questions about its effectiveness and a contentious full approval decision that overruled some FDA staff recommendations. The company's stock has declined significantly this year amid these ongoing safety and efficacy concerns.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining access to significant oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce ruling rejected Exxon Mobil's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the offshore Stabroek Block. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth stated the outcome was expected and affirmed that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate mergers. The resolution ends a period of uncertainty that had impacted Chevron's stock performance.</p>

          <p>A House Judiciary Committee memo alleges that the Biden-Harris administration misused taxpayer funds to support anti-government protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the October 7th attacks. The memo claims that U.S. grant money was funneled through several NGOs to organizations that were directly involved in the protests against judicial reform. Prime Minister Netanyahu amplified the allegations, claiming it was foreign intervention to undermine his government. The investigation by the committee is reportedly ongoing.</p>

According to Home Office accounts, this saving was achieved by reducing the average nightly cost per person through the use of cheaper accommodations and increased room sharing. Officials prioritized moving families out of hotels into local housing. However, an expert from the Migration Observatory warned that a recent surge in small boat crossings could force a renewed reliance on more expensive hotel accommodations.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence (GRU) units and 18 officers for conducting a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity. The Foreign Office stated the spies were working to "destabilise Europe" and had targeted UK media, infrastructure, and political institutions. This action was announced as the European Union also unveiled its 18th round of sanctions against Russia, aimed at undermining Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The UK's Foreign Secretary affirmed that such hybrid threats would not break the nation's resolve.</p>

However, an immigration lawyer claims Khanbabazadeh was in the process of adjusting his legal status after marrying a U.S. citizen and was not in the country illegally.

          <p>Recent sectarian violence in Syria's Sweida province highlights a fundamental policy disagreement between the United States and Israel. The U.S., through its special envoy, has pushed for a strong, centralized government under Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, believing federalism has failed. In contrast, Israel remains distrustful of Sharaa's jihadist past and has supported local minority groups like the Druze, fearing a powerful, unified Syria. This conflicting approach may have contributed to the latest clashes, which escalated into a bloody conflict and prompted Israeli airstrikes on Damascus.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that TikTok's platform makes hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss, restrictive diets, and cosmetic surgery easily accessible to underage users, violating its own community guidelines. By creating an account for a hypothetical 15-year-old, the investigation showed that interacting with such content led the algorithm to recommend more of it, including videos glorifying eating disorders. Despite TikTok's claims that it works to remove harmful content, critics argue these findings show a systemic failure to protect young users from dangerous material.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing "Schedule G," a new classification for federal employees in policy-related roles, making them at-will political appointees. This means they can be more easily hired and fired and are expected to leave with changing administrations, a move the White House claims will dismantle the "deep state." Critics and public service advocates argue the order is another attempt to politicize the nonpartisan civil service, similar to the revived Schedule F, and will ultimately harm the government's ability to serve the public effectively.</p>

          <p>Kathryn Restelli, a 37-year-old Utah woman, has pleaded guilty to murder and conspiracy charges for her role in the killing of her estranged husband, Matthew Restelli. According to court testimony, she lured him to her mother's home under the pretense of reconciliation, where her brother, Kevin Ellis, ambushed and fatally shot him. The family had allegedly planned to stage the scene to look like self-defense, but police grew suspicious of a knife found in the victim's hand. Restelli's mother and brother are also charged and face their own trials next year.</p>
