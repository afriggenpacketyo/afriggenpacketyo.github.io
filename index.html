          <h2>Tesla's Second-Quarter Profits and Revenue Decline Amid Concerns Over Brand Image</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 18:22:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has reported a significant 16% slump in profits and a 12% drop in revenue for the second quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of decline. Analysts attribute the downturn to public perception of CEO Elon Musk, whose political activities have reportedly damaged the company's brand, turning it "toxic" for some consumers. Despite the poor near-term results, some investors remain focused on the company's long-term potential in AI and its Robotaxi venture. The company also faces headwinds from the elimination of a federal EV tax credit and increased competition from rivals like China's BYD.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IBM shares dropped despite the company reporting second-quarter earnings and overall revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The decline was attributed to software revenue falling slightly short of analyst projections, as some clients reportedly reprioritized spending towards hardware. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that geopolitical tensions and constrained U.S. federal spending created some caution among clients. However, the company's infrastructure and consulting divisions performed strongly, and IBM maintained its full-year guidance, expressing optimism about future growth through AI and potential acquisitions.

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to ensure U.S. leadership in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions aimed at accelerating AI development by supporting infrastructure like data centers and removing regulatory hurdles. Key provisions involve compelling federal agencies to repeal rules obstructing AI, withholding funds from states with "burdensome" regulations, and establishing rules to eliminate perceived ideological bias in chatbots. The initiative also focuses on creating AI export packages for allies to compete with countries like China.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that missed analyst estimates, with net income falling 42% from the previous year. Despite the shortfall, the airline reported that travel demand has stabilized, aligning with trends seen across the industry. The carrier has been overhauling its business model, introducing new fare types and planning a shift away from its long-standing open seating policy. The company also announced a new $2 billion share buyback program, signaling confidence to investors even as it navigates a competitive travel market with increased discounting.

On the American side, the article posits that only a handful of countries would provide limited military assistance, with Japan's involvement likely restricted to patrols and missile strikes.

Currently, home sellers face taxes on profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The proposal follows the introduction of the "No Tax on Home Sales Act" by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, which aims to unlock equity for long-term homeowners and address housing shortages. While the idea could benefit many homeowners, particularly in high-value states, experts suggest it could be costly and that a more likely outcome would be raising the exemption threshold rather than full elimination.

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, is backing legislation to exempt U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports. The bill, named the CANADA Act, comes as Trump threatens a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian goods, escalating a trade dispute with America's largest trading partner. Proponents argue the tariffs harm small businesses that rely on cross-border trade by driving up costs and threatening jobs. The legislation specifically targets existing and potential tariffs, aiming to alleviate their economic impact on smaller enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from Vox examines why the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has evolved into a dominant conspiracy theory that resonates across the political spectrum. The known facts—a wealthy financier with elite connections accused of sex crimes who died mysteriously in jail—provide a canvas for various narratives, whether for Me Too advocates, MAGA followers, or Trump's opponents. The analysis highlights how Trump's base became fixated on the scandal to target Democrats, largely ignoring Trump's own documented ties to Epstein. The administration's subsequent attempts to downplay the issue have only fueled more suspicion and media scrutiny.</p>

          <p>U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified a 2020 Republican-authored report that she claims shows a "treasonous conspiracy" by the Obama administration to undermine the 2016 election. The document challenges the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia sought to help Donald Trump win, alleging the CIA used flawed analysis. Democrats have dismissed the move as a distraction from the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and pointed to a bipartisan Senate report that upheld the original findings of Russian interference. President Trump has echoed the report's claims, accusing former President Obama of treason.</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations since the Obama administration. Internal data shows nearly 150,000 deportations in the first half of the year, projecting an annual total over 300,000, the highest since 2014. This figure, however, still falls far short of the administration's goal of one million annual deportations. The agency's efforts have been bolstered by a massive funding increase and a sweeping mandate to reverse previous limits on immigration arrests and expand categories for removal.</p>

The Macrons' complaint states that Owens ignored multiple retraction demands and continued to publish "outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions" for fame and profit.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily allowed President Trump to fire three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) without cause. The decision, opposed by the court's three liberal justices, allows the terminations to proceed while the case is litigated in lower courts. This action challenges a 90-year-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects the independence of certain regulatory agencies by restricting a president's power to remove officials at will. The fired commissioners had sued, arguing their appointments could only be ended for malfeasance, not for political reasons.</p>

This article explores the phenomenon of "panopticontent," where ordinary people are turned into public figures without consent. It raises ethical questions about the normalization of surveillance and the role of brands and social media platforms in amplifying personal matters for public consumption.</p>

This trend of overconsumption, which began in the 1970s, is visible in deforestation, biodiversity loss, and atmospheric carbon accumulation.

The case spurred the creation of national missing children registries, the famous milk carton campaigns, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

          <p>The phenomenon known as "corn sweat" refers to the process of evapotranspiration, where vast fields of corn release significant amounts of moisture into the air during hot, sunny weather. This process can dramatically increase humidity, making heat waves in the Midwest feel more oppressive and dangerous, with heat indexes soaring. While evapotranspiration from any dense vegetation cools the air, the uniformity and scale of corn monocultures can intensify this effect. As climate change makes heat waves more common, the interaction between agriculture and extreme weather is becoming an increasing concern for public health.</p>
