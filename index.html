          <p>General Motors has revised its 2025 financial guidance downward, attributing the change to an anticipated $5 billion impact from tariffs. Despite this, CEO Mary Barra asserts that the company's core business remains strong and is adapting to the evolving trade policy landscape by reinforcing its supply base and focusing on electric vehicle profitability. The updated guidance reflects lower net income and adjusted automotive free cash flow expectations. Barra mentioned GM's efforts to mitigate tariff costs by increasing U.S.-sourced parts and utilizing existing assembly plant capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Initial unemployment claims in the U.S. saw an unexpected increase, reaching 241,000, the highest level since February, suggesting possible challenges for the U.S. economy. Continuing claims also rose, reaching their highest point since November 2021, with a significant portion of the increase stemming from New York. Economists suggest that this uptick could indicate a broader trend of rising jobless claims in the coming weeks, despite the labor market remaining relatively stable.

          <p>Ukraine has signed an agreement granting the United States control over a share of its future revenue from natural resources through a joint investment fund, aiming to secure continued U.S. support amidst its ongoing conflict with Russia. The deal, finalized after difficult negotiations, gives President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's fate while addressing concerns about unchecked U.S. aid. The agreement specifies that the fund will be financed by revenues from new projects in critical minerals, oil, and gas, but does not treat past aid as debt. Ukraine's parliament is expected to ratify the agreement soon, and the deal also aims to prevent Russia from benefiting from Ukraine's reconstruction after the war.</p>

This statement follows a period of consumer backlash related to Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had impacted Tesla's sales and profits.

          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, but subsequently lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks stated that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing the return of critical supply chains to the U.S. The blockbuster diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight loss drug Zepbound exceeded sales expectations, and the company is also advocating for permanently lower tax rates to incentivize domestic manufacturing. The company's shares fell after CVS Health announced Novo Nordisk's Wegovy would be the preferred weight loss medication on its main formularies instead of Zepbound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives voted to block California from enforcing stricter clean air standards for trucks and smog reduction, challenging the state's authority to set its own pollution regulations. Republicans, with some Democratic support, passed measures to revoke California's clean truck waiver and nitrogen oxide limits, arguing that the state should not dictate national policy. These actions threaten California's ability to implement ambitious climate policies, including a ban on gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Governor Newsom criticized Republicans for siding with fossil fuel interests, while Democrats and public health advocates emphasized the importance of California's waivers for reducing pollution.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported an unexpected 1% decline in first-quarter global sales, attributing the drop to cautious spending by cash-strapped diners in key markets amid economic uncertainty. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted the "toughest of market conditions," worsened by the disruptive nature of Donald Trump's trade policy, which has increased financial strain on lower-income customers. The U.S. economy is struggling, with recent data showing a contraction in the first quarter, increasing the chances of a recession in 2025. McDonald's is attempting to boost demand through value menu offers, similar to its rivals.</p>

          <p>The trial has begun for Erin Patterson, an Australian woman accused of murdering three people by poisoning them with toxic mushrooms in a beef Wellington dish. Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming the poisoning was accidental. Her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, testified that he declined an invitation to the lunch because he felt uncomfortable. The prosecution alleges that Erin Patterson invited her guests under the pretense of telling them she had cancer, which medical tests later found no evidence of. The trial is expected to last six weeks.</p>

The request to depose Aymond argues that his testimony is relevant and necessary, as he was previously scheduled to be questioned before the bankruptcy filing halted proceedings.

The elections include over 1,600 council members in 24 municipalities, as well as six regional mayors, with results expected throughout Friday. The outcome will test Reform's ability to convert opinion poll surges into actual votes and the stability of the two leading parties.</p>

          <p>President Trump's assertion that new tariffs could significantly reduce or eliminate individual income taxes for most Americans is being met with skepticism from tax experts. While Trump suggests tariffs could raise enough revenue to cut income taxes, particularly for those earning under $200,000 a year, analysts argue that the revenue generated by tariffs would be insufficient to replace the lost income tax revenue. Additionally, tariffs disproportionately affect low- and middle-income Americans and could trigger a recession. Tax experts emphasize that the authority to change the tax code lies with Congress, not the President.</p>
