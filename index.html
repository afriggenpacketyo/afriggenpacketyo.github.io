          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a second consecutive month of growth in April, accelerating from 2.6% in March to 3%, despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. High-tech manufacturing, particularly biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing, saw significant profit increases, along with household appliance manufacturers benefiting from consumer subsidies. However, certain sectors, such as automobiles and apparel, faced headwinds due to price competition and tariff-related demand shifts, with state-owned industrial firms experiencing a profit decline while private and foreign-invested enterprises improved. Weining Yu from the NBS cautioned about persistent constraints like insufficient demand and external uncertainty, despite the industrial sector's resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from Harlem and Korean War veteran, has died at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy of public service and advocacy for social justice. Rangel served 23 terms representing New York's 13th Congressional District, sponsoring numerous bills and resolutions that became law, and was the first Black chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. Despite facing ethics violations and censure in 2010, Rangel continued to serve his constituents and remained a prominent figure in Harlem politics.

          <p>A federal judge has expressed frustration with the government's failure to provide due process to a group of migrants being held in Djibouti while the administration attempts to deport them to South Sudan. Judge Brian E. Murphy criticized the logistical challenges of holding immigration proceedings on another continent, suggesting the government could return the men to the United States if remote proceedings proved too difficult. The case is a class-action lawsuit concerning the due process rights of migrants facing deportation to third countries, with the judge's criticism reflecting growing tension between the Trump administration and the federal courts.</p>

          <p>A study by the ACSâ€™ Environmental Science & Technology found that some beers brewed in the U.S. contain high levels of PFAS, or "forever chemicals," exceeding EPA limits. The research correlated PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water with levels in locally brewed beer, indicating drinking water as a primary source of contamination. Beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan had elevated PFAS levels, while international beers from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable amounts. While breweries have water filtration systems, they are not designed to prevent PFAS from entering the batch, raising concerns about potential health impacts for consumers.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite an increase in its net external assets to a record high. The Finance Ministry attributed this shift to the yen's depreciation, which boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, and Germany's large current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets increased to 533.05 trillion yen, but remained below Germany's 569.65 trillion yen, while the United States had a net external liability of 4,109.26 trillion yen.</p>

The price reductions, including a 20% decrease for the Seagull hatchback, led investors to become cautious about potential price wars in the sector. Analysts from Citi expect the price cuts to cause a spike in footfall at BYD's dealership stores, but remain optimistic about robust sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan due to relatively mild competition.

          <p>A report by the Lowy Institute warns that the world's poorest nations are facing a "tidal wave of debt" as repayments to China reach record highs in 2025. China's Belt and Road Initiative lending spree has resulted in developing countries owing a combined US$22 billion in repayments, leading to China becoming more of a debt collector than a banker. This financial strain is jeopardizing spending on essential services like hospitals, schools, and climate change initiatives, raising concerns about China's potential to leverage these debts for geopolitical influence.</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially worth hundreds of millions, by reducing the deductible value of intangible assets. The legislation, aimed at future owners, could cool the frenzy among the wealthy to own teams by limiting the tax shelter benefits that have fueled high team prices. While team owners insist the impact will be significant, the White House claims the measure is about fairness for fans and eliminating an advantage for owners who overcharge ticketholders, with the provision estimated to raise $991 million over 10 years.

          <p>In a guest essay, Bill Saporito criticizes President Trump for demanding that retailers like Walmart absorb the costs of tariffs on goods from China, rather than raising prices for consumers. Saporito argues that Trump's demand ignores the fundamental principle that costs should not exceed revenues, pointing out that retailers will inevitably have to pass some of these costs on to consumers. He also notes the reluctance of big companies to call tariffs what they are: a tax on imported goods, paid by the importer, and suggests that small and medium-size businesses are being more transparent with customers about the impact of tariffs.</p>
