          <p>London has recorded temperatures of 31Â°C for a second consecutive day as a heatwave continues to build across the United Kingdom. An amber heat health alert is active for many regions, with forecasters predicting temperatures could peak at 33Â°C or even 34Â°C early in the week. The UK Health Security Agency has issued warnings, advising the public to check on vulnerable individuals and take sensible precautions. This marks the second such alert in two weeks, signaling likely impacts across the national health service as the heat is expected to feel more uncomfortable due to humidity and light winds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new assessment by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, a major spending bill supported by President Trump could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing healthcare and add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The analysis, which projects $1 trillion in healthcare funding cuts, is complicating Republican efforts to pass the legislation. The bill narrowly passed a procedural vote in the Senate, but faces opposition from Democrats and some Republicans concerned about its financial and social impacts. The White House is pushing for the bill's passage before a self-imposed July 4th deadline, framing it as a crucial part of its agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Virginia Senator Mark Warner has condemned a pressure campaign from the Trump administration that led to the resignation of University of Virginia President Jim Ryan. Warner described the action as an "outrageous" attack on education, revealing that Ryan was explicitly threatened with major funding cuts if he did not resign by a specific deadline. The pressure was reportedly linked to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Warner warned that this sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting that if the administration can interfere with a flagship public university like UVA, it can do so anywhere.</p>

          <p>New York City Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa has firmly stated he will not drop out of the race, dismissing rumors that donors are seeking to replace him with a more moderate candidate to challenge socialist Zohran Mamdani.

Sliwa believes he can win in a multi-candidate race by focusing on public safety and housing affordability.

          <h2>Experts Analyze the True Extent of Damage to Iran's Nuclear Program Following U.S. Strikes</h2>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of the challenges in assessing the damage from the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities. While President Trump declared the program "obliterated," preliminary intelligence reports have offered more cautious estimates. The piece explains that battle damage assessment is a complex process that takes time, integrating various intelligence sources beyond initial imagery. An educated guess, considering the advanced munitions used and the cumulative effect of a 12-day Israeli campaign, suggests the damage was likely severe, despite the difficulty in confirming the full impact immediately.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has a buyer lined up for TikTok, the popular video-sharing app facing a potential ban in the United States over national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform and that he would provide more details in about two weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, but Trump expressed confidence that President Xi Jinping would likely agree to the deal. This development comes as the deadline for parent company ByteDance to sell the app has been extended to September 17.</p>

          <p>A gold mine collapse in Sudan has resulted in the deaths of at least 11 miners, with seven others injured. The incident occurred in an artisanal shaft in a government-controlled area, according to the state-owned Sudanese Mineral Resources Company. The company stated it had previously suspended work at this specific mine due to significant safety risks. Such collapses are frequent in Sudan's artisanal mining sector, which suffers from poor safety standards and is a major source of funding for both sides of the country's ongoing civil war.</p>

          <p>According to a report citing classified U.S. intelligence, intercepted communications from Iranian officials have downplayed the damage caused by recent American military strikes on their nuclear program. This account contrasts with President Trump's assertion that the program was "completely and totally obliterated." However, a source familiar with the intelligence cautioned that the intercepts are considered unreliable indicators, and there are serious questions about the truthfulness of the Iranian officials' assessments.
