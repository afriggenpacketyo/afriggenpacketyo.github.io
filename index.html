            <p>Despite China's announcement of increased tariffs on U.S. imports, U.S. stock futures have moved into positive territory, signaling a potentially higher Wall Street opening. This development follows China's decision to raise tariffs to 125% from 84% in response to President Trump's earlier tariff hikes on Chinese goods. The market's reaction suggests resilience amid escalating trade tensions between the two economic giants. However, Asian and European markets experienced losses following China's announcement, indicating continued uncertainty in the global economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump is pushing for direct nuclear talks with Iran in Oman, but Tehran prefers indirect negotiations, leading to a public dispute over the format. Iran expert Behnam Ben Taleblu suggests this is a leverage game, with the U.S. wanting to appear in control and Iran resisting being seen as submissive. Iran's leverage stems from its advancements in uranium enrichment and closer ties with Russia and China. However, the U.S. has economic and military options to influence Iran, though the clock is ticking as JCPOA-era sanctions are set to expire. </p>

            <p>China announced it is raising tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response to President Trump's tariffs, which now total 145%. China's Commerce Ministry criticized the U.S.'s actions as violating international trade rules and filed another complaint with the World Trade Organization. The ministry stated that further U.S. tariff hikes would be ignored and deemed economically nonsensical, but China would resolutely counterattack if its interests were substantially infringed upon. This escalation in the trade war has led to market instability, with European stock indexes declining after China's announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK economy grew by 0.5% in February, surpassing economists' predictions of 0.1%, with the services sector driving the surge. The Office for National Statistics attributed the growth to computer programming, telecoms, and car dealerships. However, analysts caution that this growth may be short-lived due to impending tariffs on goods imported to the US and tax increases. While the government aims to boost economic growth, uncertainty surrounding US tariffs poses a threat to the UK's economic stability.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that despite rising tensions between the U.S. and both China and the European Union due to President Trump's tariffs, a rapid alliance between the EU and China is unlikely. Economic competition, particularly in export-driven sectors like automotive and clean tech, poses a significant hurdle. Fundamental differences, including concerns about overcapacity in China, human rights, and support for Russia, further complicate the relationship. While China may seek to exploit strained U.S.-EU ties, deep mistrust and practical constraints limit the potential for significant alignment.</p>

            <p>China's latest tariff retaliation against the U.S. raises the stakes in the ongoing trade war, but within predictable parameters. China has indicated it will ignore further tariff increases from Trump, suggesting a potential stalemate. However, Trump could escalate by invoking non-tariff measures, which could lead to more dangerous geopolitical consequences. While a truce is possible, low trust between the two countries makes a negotiated resolution unlikely, leaving the situation perilous.</p>

            <h2>Questions Surround Trump's Tariff Policies and Potential Market Manipulation</h2>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies have created chaos in the international trade system, raising questions about his understanding of international trade and potential market manipulation. Trump abruptly reversed course on “reciprocal” tariffs before raising tariffs on Chinese goods, causing market volatility. Some experts suggest the whipsawing tariff policies could provide opportunities for insider trading. There are also concerns that the policies will ultimately damage the U.S. economy by disrupting supply chains and causing stagflation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As a new wave of popular protest movements emerge in response to Trump's presidency, it's essential to assess the strategic value and potential pitfalls of protest. While protest can be a powerful tool for forcing issues onto the public agenda, it's also important to recognize how easily protest movements can be portrayed as extensions of a privileged class. To break out of this framing, protesters should emphasize relatable aspects of their identities and punch up at powerful economic culprits rather than down at people who voted for Trump. Organizations are needed to transform episodic moments of outrage into sustained campaigns.</p>

            <p>A Senate report reveals that the Trump administration has weakened tools used to combat foreign-influence campaigns, even as covert attempts by countries like Saudi Arabia and China are increasing. The report highlights difficulties in obtaining information about the Saudi state-funded Public Investment Fund (PIF) and criticizes the administration's decision to limit the consideration of criminal charges for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara).

            <p>President Trump is attempting to rework the constitutional rules that structure the American election system through an executive order on election “integrity”. He is asserting an executive-branch role in governing the mechanics of a federal election that he has no authority over, and that this order attempts to disenfranchise his opponents and forestall electoral defeat. The legal theory behind this assertion could give near-limitless authority to the executive branch to use federal resources to ensure Trump and other MAGA Republicans never lose another election. This effort may fail, but even if it does, it has laid the groundwork for more aggressive action later.</p>

            <p>American negotiators are heading to Oman for talks with Iran over its nuclear program, a move that could lead to either a deal or military action. President Trump has given Iran a deadline to reach an agreement, and Iran's president appears more open to talks. However, disagreements remain over the format of the talks and the scope of any potential deal. The situation is further complicated by Iran's growing stockpile of near-weapons grade uranium and Israel's willingness to strike Iranian targets.</p>

            <p>A new cancer pill, capivasertib, has been recommended for NHS use in England and Wales, offering potential benefits for women with advanced breast cancer. The drug has shown promise in slowing the progression of the disease and improving quality of life. While not everyone is likely to have positive results from the drug, in trials, in 708 women, when combined with hormone therapy, the drug doubled the time the cancer took to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months, and shrank tumours in 23% of patients. The treatment is suitable for those with certain gene mutations.</p>
