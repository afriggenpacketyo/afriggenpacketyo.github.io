          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record by rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia was fraught with challenges, including violent storms that swept one brother overboard temporarily. The trio undertook the grueling expedition to raise over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar, honoring the memory of their late sister. They successfully beat the previous record of 162 days, arriving in Cairns to a warm reception from family and friends.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal decision. The court overturned an injunction obtained by Epping Forest District Council, which was seen as a key test case for similar challenges nationwide. Despite this setback, councils and political figures insist they will press on with legal action, citing planning law breaches and unsustainable strain on local services. The ruling highlights the ongoing political and legal tensions surrounding the government's asylum accommodation policies.</p>

          <p>Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a sharp and sustained drop in fatal drug overdoses in the United States since mid-2023. Despite this positive trend, the Trump administration continues to emphasize the growing threat of fentanyl to justify policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and potential military action against cartels. Critics argue these tactics are misguided and that progress could be undermined by potential cuts to addiction and health programs. Experts are still studying the reasons for the decline, attributing it to a combination of disrupted supply chains and improved healthcare for addiction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several European countries are reconsidering or reinstating military conscription in response to growing security concerns, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany is introducing a "new military service" model that is initially voluntary but has the potential for mandatory conscription, while nations like Sweden, Latvia, and Lithuania have already brought back some form of compulsory service. Countries such as Finland never abolished it, maintaining a large reserve force. This trend reflects a broader strategic shift across the continent, with many governments focusing on expanding both active military personnel and reserve forces to bolster national defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>At least three people have died after protestors set fire to a regional parliament building in Makassar, Indonesia, during widespread demonstrations. The protests, which have turned violent in several cities, were initially sparked by public anger over a new, generous housing allowance for lawmakers amid rising living costs. Tensions escalated following the death of a ride-hailing driver who was struck by a police vehicle during a rally in Jakarta. The incident has led to clashes between demonstrators and riot police, numerous arrests, and criticism from human rights groups over the authorities' response.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso is signaling a willingness to unilaterally change Senate rules to confirm President Trump's pending nominees, bypassing Democratic opposition. Negotiations to approve dozens of non-controversial appointments collapsed after President Trump rejected funding demands from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. With 145 nominations stalled, Barrasso argues that Republicans may have to "roll over" the Democrats or see the president make recess appointments. This potential use of the "nuclear option" escalates the partisan conflict over appointments and could impact future legislative cooperation on critical issues like government funding.</p>

          <p>Despite another quarter of blockbuster earnings from chipmaker Nvidia, its stock dipped, reflecting growing investor uncertainty about the sustainability of the AI-driven market boom. While Big Tech's massive investments in artificial intelligence have propped up the stock market, a recent MIT survey revealed that 95% of companies experimenting with AI are not yet seeing any revenue from it. This disconnect between investment and return is raising questions about a potential bubble. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's unprecedented interventions, including a deal with Nvidia and taking a stake in Intel, adding a layer of political risk to the tech sector.

These laws compel tech companies to prevent children from accessing harmful or age-inappropriate content, leading to the adoption of age-verification systems by platforms like Pornhub, Spotify, and X. Companies like Yoti are using AI-based facial analysis to estimate age, while phone manufacturers are developing devices with built-in features to block explicit content.

          <p>A tactical analysis of Manchester United under manager Rúben Amorim suggests the team's poor performances, including a recent cup loss to Grimsby Town, stem from his rigid 5-2-3 positional system. The article details how Amorim's strategy, which relies on creating numerical overloads and executing specific passing patterns, is often neutralized by opponents using man-to-man marking. The system discourages individual dribbling and creative roaming, making United's attacks predictable. Defensively, the team's two-man midfield is frequently outnumbered, allowing opponents to control games once they bypass the initial press, raising questions about the manager's methods.</p>

The ruling is a setback for the administration's effort to use "expedited removal," a process that deports some migrants without a court hearing before a judge. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb argued that applying this statute to a large group of people living in the country's interior requires affording them due process under the Fifth Amendment. This decision follows a previous ruling by the same judge that blocked the fast-track deportation of immigrants who had entered legally under humanitarian parole.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks suffered a heartbreaking 76-75 loss to the Indiana Fever after a critical turnover in the final seconds of the game. After leading for much of the contest, the Sparks unraveled in the final moments when a bad pass was stolen by Indiana's Aliyah Boston with under four seconds remaining, preventing a potential game-winning shot. The defeat is a significant blow to the Sparks' playoff aspirations, as they remain in ninth place and two games out of the final postseason spot. Former Spark, Sims, scored the game-winning basket for the Fever, who played without the injured Caitlin Clark.</p>

          <p>A human microbiome scientist, Wang Leyao, has left her position at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to join the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation in China. Wang was also a member of the NIH climate and health scholars cohort. Her departure comes as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) faces significant turmoil, including funding cuts and policy shifts under the Trump administration. This move is indicative of a broader trend where instability and funding challenges within U.S. government research agencies may be prompting talented scientists to seek opportunities elsewhere.</p>
