          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, accompanied by several European leaders to present a united front. The meeting follows a Trump-Putin summit and comes after Trump publicly suggested Ukraine should concede on retaking Crimea and abandon its ambitions to join NATO. The talks are critical for the future of Western support for Ukraine, as allies aim to shore up Zelenskyy's position and discuss a path to ending the three-and-a-half-year war with Russia.</p>

          <p>A series of articles explores the complex landscape of China's efforts to expand its global soft power and cultural influence. Topics range from the waning interest in learning Mandarin in the West to the surprising success of Chinese-made "ugly-cute" dolls like Labubu in the American market. The analysis also covers how popular streaming shows and state-backed think tanks are being utilized to shape China's narrative abroad, even as observers urge for a more relaxed approach to cultural exchange to counteract decoupling with the West.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its allies to offer Ukraine security guarantees similar to NATO's Article 5. This development is described as "game-changing" as it could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. The potential agreement would see the U.S. and a coalition of willing nations commit to defending Ukraine from future aggression, a key demand from Kyiv in any peace settlement.</p>

          <p>Zimbabwe is experiencing a sharp spike in malaria cases and deaths this year, a crisis that experts link to U.S. aid cuts made early in the Trump presidency. The funding withdrawal debilitated the Zimbabwe Entomological Support Programme in Malaria, hindering preventative measures like the distribution of mosquito nets. Between January and May, malaria-related deaths in the country more than tripled compared to the previous year, highlighting the severe public health consequences of disruptions in international medical support.</p>

          <p>Bolivia appears set to elect a non-left-wing president for the first time in nearly two decades, with preliminary results showing a run-off between two right-leaning candidates, Senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and former president Jorge Quiroga. The election marks a significant political shift for the nation, driven by voter frustration over a severe economic crisis under the incumbent socialist party, MAS. The outcome could lead to major changes in foreign policy, potentially fostering closer ties with the U.S. and increasing foreign investment in Bolivia's lithium reserves.</p>

          <p>The UK's Green Party is at a strategic crossroads as its leadership contest pits a radical, "eco-populist" approach against the party's more traditional, broad-appeal strategy. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bolder, anti-elite message to connect with voter anger, while current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns argue for continuing the successful formula that saw the party expand from one to four parliamentary seats. The outcome will determine the party's direction as it seeks to build on its recent electoral gains.</p>

          <p>The U.S. total fertility rate remains historically low at just over 1.6 children per woman, well below the 2.1 rate needed for natural population replacement, according to recent CDC data. The trend is driven by a significant decline in births among women under 30, including a continued drop in teenage pregnancies. Demographers are concerned about the long-term economic consequences, such as a shrinking workforce to support an aging population and potential strains on social security and higher education enrollment.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist Croatian singer Thompson has highlighted deep divisions within the country over its history, particularly its World War Two-era fascist past. The event featured the widespread use of the chant "Za dom, spremni," a slogan associated with the Nazi-allied Ustasha regime, which has been condemned by human rights groups but downplayed by the government. The controversy exposes a polarized society, with some viewing the slogan as a patriotic symbol, while others see it as a dangerous glorification of fascism.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population having declined for 15 consecutive years and on track to halve by the end of the century. The nation now sells more adult diapers than baby diapers, and the shrinking population is creating labor shortages and straining social systems. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a city-run dating app and shortened workweeks to encourage marriage and family formation, while some politicians advocate for revitalizing rural areas to make them more attractive to young families.</p>
