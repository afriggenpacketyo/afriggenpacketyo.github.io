          <p>A Palestinian-American man has died from smoke inhalation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank following a confrontation where settlers reportedly set fire to homes and vehicles. U.S. officials confirmed the death of Khamis Ayyad and offered condolences, condemning the criminal violence. This incident marks the second death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank in three weeks, occurring amid a significant increase in settler attacks and broader regional conflict. The Palestinian Authority reported that Israeli forces also fired upon residents who were responding to the attacks.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore information about Donald Trump's two impeachments to its American presidency exhibit in the coming weeks. The museum faced public criticism after the references were removed, sparking concerns of historical whitewashing. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any pressure from the Trump administration, explaining that the original temporary placard did not meet museum standards for presentation. The updated exhibit will be integrated into the section on the limits of presidential power, alongside materials related to other presidents.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has indicated that Vice President Kamala Harris may receive a subpoena as part of his investigation into an alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. Comer's comments place Harris, who is currently on a national listening tour, back in the political spotlight. Legal experts like Jonathan Turley note that while Harris is a logical witness, compelling her testimony would likely face significant legal challenges based on executive privilege. The situation presents a political dilemma for Harris as she considers a potential 2028 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun its August recess without confirming dozens of Donald Trump's nominees, following a breakdown in negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. President Trump publicly criticized Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as the talks failed. Democrats have been systematically blocking quick confirmations, forcing lengthy procedural votes for each nominee. In response, Republicans are now considering changing Senate rules in September to expedite the process, a move that Democrats warn would be a significant mistake and further erode bipartisanship.</p>

The project, part of a larger $19 billion airport overhaul, will create JFK's largest terminal, dedicated solely to international travel and designed to be flooded with natural light. When fully completed in 2030, the terminal will feature 23 gates, extensive retail and dining space, and its own resilient microgrid. The development is a key part of nationwide efforts to modernize aging airport infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the Trump administration's broad new tariff plan, stating that the rates are largely set and unlikely to be negotiated down soon. Greer explained that the President's strategy aims to reduce the trade deficit and reshore manufacturing, sometimes favoring a tariff over a negotiated deal. He also addressed the use of tariffs as a tool for geopolitical leverage, citing actions against Canada and Brazil as examples of responding to non-trade issues like foreign policy or perceived misuse of democracy.

          <p>Germany's fertility rate has fallen to 1.35 children per woman, one of the lowest levels on record, sparking a debate about societal pressures and economic anxieties. Experts suggest that multiple crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and inflation, are contributing to the decline, as young people face increasing uncertainty. While some on the far-right call for more births to combat labor shortages, sociologists point to a significant "fertility gap," where the desired number of children is higher than the actual birth rate. Improving work-life balance and reliable childcare are seen as crucial to reversing the trend.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's southern Guangdong province are taking decisive action after thousands of new cases of chikungunya fever were reported last week. The mosquito-borne viral disease, which causes fever and severe joint pain, saw 2,892 new cases, with the majority concentrated in the city of Foshan. The provincial governor has called for resolute measures to contain the outbreak as quickly as possible. National health officials are also involved, urging swift efforts to stamp out the spread and ensure public health and social stability in the region.</p>

          <p>British Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant has publicly stated that he was sexually abused as a teenager in 1978 by Michael Croft, the late founder and head of the National Youth Theatre. Bryant detailed the abuse in an interview, explaining he felt he had no choice but to comply with the demands of Croft, who was 40 years his senior. The National Youth Theatre issued a statement expressing sorrow and solidarity with Bryant and other victims of the same perpetrator. Bryant also revealed he had been sexually assaulted by five male MPs during his time in Parliament but never reported them.</p>

          <p>The use of AI to automatically scan for and bill damages, as recently implemented by rental car companies, is a trend experts expect to see across the service industry. This practice, termed 'algorithmic auditing,' could soon be applied in hotels to detect issues like smoking in rooms or property damage, with charges automatically applied to a guest's bill. While businesses see this as a way to improve efficiency and prevent loss, critics warn it could erode customer trust. The key challenge for companies will be balancing automation with the human judgment and empathy that characterize good customer service.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and county prosecutor, to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Her confirmation, on a 50-45 vote, fills the post after President Trump's first nominee withdrew due to a lack of Republican support. Pirro, who frequently interviewed Trump on her show, has significantly more courtroom experience than the previous nominee. Her confirmation comes despite her being named in a major libel lawsuit filed by Smartmatic against Fox News over false 2020 election claims.</p>

          <p>An American woman has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her role in a sophisticated scheme that helped thousands of North Korean IT workers secure remote employment with U.S. companies. The woman acted as a domestic facilitator, managing "laptop farms" and finances, which allowed the workers to pose as U.S. citizens and funnel millions of dollars back to the North Korean government. U.S. authorities stated that the revenue from this widespread fraud was used to fund North Korea's illicit weapons programs, highlighting a significant national security and cybersecurity threat.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has stalled on releasing documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, several ongoing legal cases could force crucial information into the public domain. A public records lawsuit filed by a news website is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein file. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to reconsider unsealing more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser. These legal battles may succeed in bringing transparency where political pressure has so far failed.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a new type of cryogenic steel, CHSN01, designed to withstand the extreme conditions inside a nuclear fusion reactor. The material must endure both the near-absolute zero temperatures and immense magnetic forces required to contain the fusion reaction. This breakthrough solves a critical materials challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, where previous materials proved too brittle. The development, which took a decade, places China in a leading position in a key area of materials science for future energy.</p>

Field, a former Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University to start the company, saw Figma's valuation soar to over $71 billion after its stock tripled on the first day of trading. The journey included turning down a $20 billion acquisition offer from Adobe after it faced regulatory hurdles. Now, as an independent company, Figma is focused on integrating AI into its collaborative design tools to maintain its market dominance.</p>
