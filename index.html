The article highlights three cases: Nicole, who overcomes anxiety through self-compassion; James, who redefines his self-worth after a stroke; and Anjalee, who processes childhood trauma after her mother's death. Therapists employ cognitive behavioral therapy and other techniques to help patients understand and manage their minds, leading to significant life changes. The series underscores the potential of talking therapies to improve mental well-being, although research indicates that they are not universally effective.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that it would have to raise prices due to tariffs, urging the company to absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers.

Trump's response reflects his ongoing focus on trade and his insistence that companies should bear the burden of tariffs rather than increase prices for customers.
