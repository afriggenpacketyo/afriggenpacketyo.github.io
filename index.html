          <p>A Republican bill to end the government shutdown has failed in the Senate for the tenth time, leaving lawmakers deadlocked over federal funding. The core disagreement centers on Democrats' insistence that any funding bill must extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which Republicans want to address separately after reopening the government. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly has urged President Trump to engage directly in negotiations to break the impasse, while a bipartisan group of senators is reportedly exploring potential solutions to the stalemate.</p>

          <p>Over 3,000 individuals in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim against Johnson & Johnson, alleging that the company's talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with asbestos, leading to cancer and other diseases.

Johnson & Johnson has directed inquiries to Kenvue, its former consumer health business, which maintains that its products are safe and compliant with regulatory standards.</p>

The article highlights silver's role as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability, providing portfolio diversification similar to other precious metals but at a lower cost. It points to recent price increases as a potential opportunity for profit, though it also advises that precious metals should constitute a limited portion of a diversified portfolio.

          <p>Walmart has partnered with OpenAI to allow customers to browse products and complete purchases directly within the ChatGPT interface. This integration utilizes ChatGPT's new "Instant Checkout" feature, aiming to transform e-commerce from a reactive search-based model to a proactive, conversational experience that anticipates customer needs. The move represents a significant step into "agentic commerce" for the retail giant, where AI assistants handle tasks like meal planning and restocking essentials on behalf of the consumer.</p>

          <p>Two Federal Reserve Governors, Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller, have offered conflicting opinions on the appropriate pace for lowering interest rates. Miran advocated for a more aggressive half-percentage-point cut at the upcoming meeting, citing geopolitical tensions and a weakening labor market. In contrast, Waller supported a more cautious quarter-point reduction, aligning with the apparent consensus, while emphasizing the need to monitor how economic data reconciles before committing to further cuts. Both officials were appointed by President Trump.</p>

          <p>A project to build a major rare earths refinery in East Yorkshire has been abandoned after the company, Pensana, decided to pursue investment in the United States instead. The facility would have processed raw materials from a mine in Angola, giving the UK a strategic position in an industry dominated by China. However, the company's chairman stated that the UK government's financial support was insufficient to make the project economically viable, contrasting it with the substantial investment and price guarantees offered in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers against the Trump administration over delays in student loan forgiveness processing has been put on hold due to the government shutdown. The lawsuit accuses the Department of Education of unlawfully managing repayment plans and creating a massive backlog of over one million applications, preventing borrowers from accessing relief. This delay raises concerns that borrowers who are due for forgiveness may not receive it before a tax exemption on canceled student debt expires at the end of 2025.</p>

Published witness statements from a national security adviser assert that China conducts "large scale espionage" against the UK, intensifying questions about why the prosecution was halted.</p>
