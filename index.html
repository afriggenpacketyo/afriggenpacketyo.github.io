          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Cory Booker conducted a 12-hour sit-in protest on the Capitol steps, opposing the Republican budget plan integral to President Trump's agenda. Livestreamed across multiple platforms, the protest garnered approximately 6 million views, highlighting the Democrats' resistance to potential Medicaid cuts and other aspects of the budget. Joined by other lawmakers and advocates, Jeffries and Booker emphasized the need to prioritize the American people over what they deemed a 'cruel budget.' The protest aimed to creatively challenge business as usual and spark a national conversation on moral values and the budget's impact on families.</p>

          <p>As President Trump approaches his 100th day in office, his approval ratings are showing a decline, with the majority of Americans expressing disapproval of his handling of the presidency. Three separate polls indicate approval ratings hovering between 39% and 45%, marking the lowest figures for a newly elected president at this milestone in over seven decades. This represents a notable shift from the increase in favorability ratings Trump experienced upon returning to the White House in January. This dip reflects growing public skepticism regarding Trump's transformative actions in government.</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz defended Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth amidst controversy surrounding the Pentagon's leadership and reports of internal chaos. Waltz dismissed concerns about dysfunction, attributing them to a 'media narrative' and praising Hegseth's efforts to reform the Pentagon and enforce accountability. He contrasted Hegseth's leadership with that of his predecessor, emphasizing Hegseth's active role and intolerance for leaks. This support comes as Hegseth faces scrutiny for his involvement in Signal group chats discussing military strikes and the recent departures of senior aides, prompting some Democrats to call for an investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared his intention to reinstate Columbus Day, reversing the recent practice of recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day alongside it. Trump accused Democrats of attempting to diminish Christopher Columbus's legacy and undermine Italian Americans' appreciation for him. He stated that Columbus Day would return to its traditional rules, dates, and locations, disregarding the previous administration's efforts to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples Day. This decision marks a continuation of Trump's objections to interpreting American history through a lens of diversity and oppression, despite the holiday's origins as a nod to the country's growing diversity.</p>

          <p>Following a court decision partially lifting a freeze on employee firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Trump administration officials, in collaboration with associates of Elon Musk, moved swiftly to terminate nearly all of the agency's employees. Termination notices were sent to approximately 1,500 employees, leaving only about 200 retained. A judge has temporarily halted the cuts, raising questions about the legality of the firings and whether they exceeded the court's allowance. The details of these actions are being examined in court to determine if the firings can proceed, potentially impacting the agency's ability to oversee banks and enforce consumer protection laws.</p>

Carney, the former head of both the Banks of Canada and England, became prime minister after Justin Trudeau's resignation. Poilievre, a long-time politician, advocates for a low-tax, small government approach. The Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, focuses on Quebec's interests, while Jagmeet Singh leads the New Democratic Party. This election marks a significant shift with Trudeau's absence and the emergence of new leaders navigating a changing political landscape.</p>

          <p>Despite a ceasefire agreement following a devastating earthquake, the Myanmar army was witnessed repeatedly violating it in rebel-held territory. A BBC reporter observed daily violations, including rocket and mortar attacks, resulting in civilian and fighter casualties. One such instance was the death of a father killed in a military strike, despite the ceasefire. The UN has noted the military's continued operations, with the junta claiming they were attacked by resistance groups. The situation underscores the ongoing conflict and the challenges of achieving peace in Myanmar.</p>

This injury raises concerns given Glasnow's history, which includes a previous elbow sprain and Tommy John surgery in 2021. The team has been dealing with pitching injuries, as Blake Snell has been on the injured list since April 6 with left-shoulder inflammation. Glasnow, who has a 1-0 record with a 3.78 ERA, had given up two solo home runs before exiting the game.</p>

The show, from the creators of "The Band's Visit," explores McCurdy's life and the bizarre afterlife of his body, which was displayed in traveling carnivals and a Long Beach fun house. Critics have praised the musical's unique staging and macabre elegance, but note that it is less emotionally accessible than "The Band's Visit". The musical is a quirky and eccentric exploration of the American moneymaking ethos.</p>
