            <p>Global stock markets experienced a significant rally following President Trump's decision to temporarily halt the implementation of new tariffs on most American trading partners for a 90-day period, excluding China. Asian markets led the rebound, recovering from earlier turbulence caused by escalating trade war fears. While most markets saw gains, Trump also increased tariffs on Chinese goods to a cumulative 125%, citing a "lack of respect" from Beijing after China announced 84% reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods.

            <p>Eathan Cooper, a 24-year-old from Cambridgeshire, has been a victim of car cloning, receiving numerous fines for traffic violations in areas he had not visited. The fines, related to a black BMW with his vehicle registration, poured in from London and Essex, causing him considerable distress. Despite providing evidence of his innocence, Transport for London initially rejected his appeals. After the BBC contacted TfL, they apologized and acknowledged that his vehicle had been cloned.</p>

While tariffs on China have been raised to 125%, the overall objectives remain unchanged. The trade war is expected to continue impacting global supply chains, with one report suggesting that China could simply stop exporting, rendering the tariffs ineffective. (not investment advice)</p>
