          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker has commented on the conclusion of the "Sex and the City" revival, "And Just Like That," describing the decision to end the series as a respectful choice to conclude on a high note. While suggesting a hiatus is possible, she shifted focus to her literary work with her book imprint, SJP Lit. Parker highlighted her latest book club selection, "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 1600s Amsterdam. She praised the book for its skillful blend of historical fact and dramatic storytelling, exploring themes of ambition, identity, and power.</p>

          <p>A terrorist attack in Manchester resulted in the deaths of two Jewish individuals and serious injuries to four others outside a synagogue during the holy day of Yom Kippur. The assailant used a vehicle to ram into people before launching a stabbing attack, and was subsequently shot and killed by police at the scene. Authorities reported that the suspect, who wore a vest resembling an explosive device, was prevented from entering the synagogue by security staff and worshippers. The incident has been declared a terrorist act, leading to two additional arrests and heightened security at synagogues across the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean Combs, who has been in custody for a year, is scheduled for sentencing after a federal trial ended in a split verdict. He was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution but acquitted of more severe charges like sex trafficking and racketeering. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of over a decade, citing a history of violence, while the defense has requested a sentence that could lead to his release by year's end. The trial featured graphic testimony from multiple women, including singer Cassie Ventura, who detailed years of abuse, manipulation, and coercion.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, reporting 497,099 units delivered, though production saw a slight decline. The figures were released as a key federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired, which may have spurred a rush in purchases. The company's performance was impacted by a sales slump in Europe, attributed to consumer backlash and increased competition, but was partially offset by strong demand in the United States. Tesla also reported significant growth in its energy storage business, deploying 12.5 GWh of its battery products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Baltimore immigration judge has denied asylum to Kilmar Ábrego García, a 30-year-old Salvadoran national who was wrongfully deported and later returned to the U.S. by the Trump administration. Ábrego García, who has an American wife and children, now faces new plans for deportation despite having no criminal convictions. His case has drawn national attention as administration officials have publicly labeled him a gang member, which his lawyers argue has prejudiced his ability to receive a fair trial.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has framed the ongoing government shutdown as a strategic chance to eliminate federal agencies and programs favored by Democrats. This follows the administration's move to freeze billions in funding for infrastructure and climate projects, primarily in states with Democratic leadership. Trump stated he would meet with OMB Director Russell Vought, a key figure in the conservative Project 2025 plan, to decide on potentially permanent cuts. The White House has also confirmed that mass firings of federal employees are being considered, escalating the political conflict as the funding impasse continues with no resolution in sight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has indicated that a decision is approaching on whether to replace the league's current profit and sustainability rules (PSR). The existing regulations, which limit clubs to losses of £105 million over three years, have faced criticism for stifling investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's model, which would allow clubs to spend a percentage of their revenue on squad-related costs. A final decision on adopting the new financial control system is expected to be made at a meeting in November.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that continues to puzzle even some Finns. The World Happiness Report measures contentment based on how citizens rate their lives against the best possible life, rather than daily joy. Experts suggest Finland's success stems from a societal structure that provides strong public services, such as extensive free libraries, and fosters a sense of collective well-being through taxation. This contentment is further supported by a deep cultural connection to nature and traditions like sauna use, which promote relaxation and mental health.</p>

          <p>Actress Michelle Pfeiffer, 67, shared that becoming a grandmother last year has profoundly changed her perspective on acting, allowing her to enjoy her work more than ever. Speaking on a podcast, she explained that this life change has helped her feel more relaxed and present, freeing her from previous anxieties about her process. Pfeiffer, who is currently involved in multiple projects including a "Yellowstone" spinoff, says she has given up the deep, prolonged immersion into roles to better balance her personal and professional life. This newfound approach, she believes, has paradoxically made her a better actor.</p>

While all forms of exercise are beneficial, aerobic activities such as running or cycling appear to have the strongest impact on mood. The article emphasizes that the greatest well-being gains are seen in sedentary individuals who transition from no activity to some, with just 21 minutes of moderate exercise daily meeting federal guidelines. For optimal results, it recommends establishing a consistent routine, tailoring workouts to specific emotional goals like stress reduction or confidence-building, and avoiding exercise addiction.</p>

Longfield described a chaotic lack of planning for children's welfare and education, highlighting an "impasse" between the Department for Education and Public Health England over school reopenings.

Disney's decision to temporarily pull Kimmel's show after his comments about a conservative activist, and then reinstate him, alienated consumers from both major political parties. According to analysis from Jefferies using Morning Consult data, sentiment from Democrats soured more sharply than Republicans, though both groups showed significant declines. A recent price hike for Disney+ also contributed to the negative perception, although analysts believe the impact on streaming subscriptions may be limited.</p>

This would allow legally present noncitizens, such as refugees, asylees, and parolees, to access coverage, reversing restrictions from a recent bill. Federal law already prohibits Medicaid for immigrants without legal status, and the Democratic plan does not seek to change this, focusing instead on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits for American citizens.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has offered a $20 billion currency swap line to Argentina to help stabilize its economy, but with a significant condition: Argentina must cancel its existing $18 billion swap arrangement with China. This move is seen as a direct challenge to China's growing financial influence in Latin America. The currency pact with China has been a crucial financial tool for Argentina, helping it manage foreign reserves and pay international debts. Analysts express concern that accepting the U.S. offer could leave Argentina vulnerable, trading one form of dependency for another in a high-stakes geopolitical maneuver. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that the death of 23-year-old Paloma Shemirani from non-Hodgkin lymphoma was influenced by her mother, a high-profile conspiracy theorist. The court found that Kate Shemirani, a former nurse who was struck off for her anti-vaccination views, persuaded her daughter to reject chemotherapy in favor of unproven alternative treatments like coffee enemas. The coroner stated that conventional treatment would have offered an 80% chance of a cure and that the influence exerted by her mother contributed more than minimally to her death. The ruling described the family's dynamics as dysfunctional and the mother's care as "incomprehensible."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has offered a deal to nine leading universities, promising substantial federal grants in exchange for their agreement to a 10-point "compact" aimed at advancing conservative ideas on campus. The proposal requires signatory universities to enhance the profile of conservatives, eliminate departments perceived as hostile to conservative thought, and ban race or sex as factors in admissions. This transactional approach has drawn sharp criticism for potentially using government power to suppress free speech and academic freedom. Critics argue it is a thinly veiled attempt to exert political control over higher education under the threat of withholding federal funds.</p>

The article refutes popular narratives of espionage or capture, asserting that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan most likely ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. It details how Earhart's husband and publisher, George Palmer Putnam, helped create a polished but sometimes exaggerated public image of her skills. After her death, he and others profited from sensationalized stories, including a fictional film that portrayed her as a patriotic spy, cementing myths that persist to this day.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold reaching new highs in 2025, investors are questioning whether it remains a smart investment. The surge is attributed to global uncertainty and strong buying from central banks, with some analysts predicting further price increases. Gold is often considered a hedge against inflation, as its value tends to hold steady when paper currencies decline. In the current economic landscape, marked by persistent inflation and market volatility, physical gold can also serve as a key tool for portfolio diversification, acting as a safe-haven asset during financial instability.

          <p>This article challenges the common misconception, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with a lower share price have greater upside potential than more expensive ones. It argues that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value or growth prospects, which are instead determined by underlying company fundamentals like revenue and earnings growth. Using the example of choosing between a lower-priced stock like International Paper and a higher-priced one like Nvidia in late 2023, the article demonstrates how focusing on fundamentals would have yielded significantly higher returns. It stresses the importance of overcoming cognitive biases for successful investing. (not investment advice)</p>
