          <h2>Trump Claims Unfamiliarity with Minnesota Speaker's Assassination While Honoring Conservative Activist</h2>

          <p>President Trump initially claimed unfamiliarity with the assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, when questioned about his decision not to lower flags to half-staff. This response starkly contrasted with his recent order to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prompting significant criticism regarding perceived political bias in recognizing victims of violence. The exchange occurred during an Oval Office briefing, where Trump was pressed on why he and Republicans consistently blame the left for political violence. He suggested he would have lowered flags if the Minnesota governor, whom he previously called "whacked out," had requested it, highlighting deep political divisions in the recognition of tragedies.</p>

          <p>A UCLA official, Johnathan Perkins, director of race and equity, has been placed on investigative leave following social media posts expressing satisfaction and indifference regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Perkins, who is Black, defended his comments by stating it is acceptable to be happy when a "racist who called for your eradication dies," citing his own experiences with systemic racism. UCLA condemned the celebration of violence as "completely unacceptable," initiating an investigation into the remarks. Perkins, in turn, criticized the university's action as "Project 2025" and "fascism at work," highlighting the intense polarization and free expression debates on campus.</p>

          <p>The US Senate has narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, President Trump's pick and current chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors. This confirmation, by a 48-47 vote, makes him the first sitting White House official to join the Fed board since the 1930s, sparking concerns about the central bank's longstanding independence. Miran, a supporter of Trump's global tariffs, is expected to participate in a key interest rate vote this week, potentially advocating for larger cuts as desired by the President. His fast-tracked confirmation highlights Trump's efforts to reshape the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rising influence of Reform UK is causing significant jitters within both the Labour and Conservative parties, as evidenced by their comfortable and sustained lead in opinion polls and recent high-profile defections.

The Liberal Democrats also express frustration over a perceived lack of attention.

          <p>Taiwan is set to receive its highest annual volume of US arms in years, with nearly $4.5 billion worth of systems in delivery, significantly boosting its defense capabilities amid mounting threats from Beijing. While most of the $21.54 billion in outstanding orders are on schedule, some key systems like the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon and F-16V Block 70 fighter jets face production and testing delays, pushing deliveries back by years. Despite the impending arrivals, questions remain about whether Taiwan's forces are fully prepared to integrate and effectively utilize these advanced weapons. The shipments aim to strengthen deterrence and war-fighting capacity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ensuring her participation in an upcoming interest rate vote. The court upheld a lower ruling, finding that firing Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to insulate the central bank from political pressure. Trump had cited unproven mortgage fraud allegations against Cook, who denied wrongdoing, in his unprecedented attempt to appoint a fourth nominee and gain a majority on the seven-member board. The decision underscores the importance of the Fed's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump asserted that "soft" policies on "Illegal Immigrant Criminals" are over under his administration, vowing to "MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN."

          <p>A 19-year-old suspect, Clinton Mayers, has been arrested in connection with the shooting and robbery of an armored truck driver outside a Kroger in Atlanta. The suspect ambushed the driver, who sustained a graze wound to the head, and escaped with $50,000 in cash. The driver is expected to recover, and the FBI has taken over the investigation, with charges anticipated soon. A witness described the robbery as smoothly executed, suggesting it was not a random act but a planned operation. The incident highlights concerns about violent crime in the city.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second state visit to the UK is anticipated to be fraught with controversy, echoing his first visit in 2019, despite extensive planning. Potential pitfalls include ongoing protests, the recent dismissal of the UK ambassador to the US, and profound policy differences on issues like NATO and the Middle East. While royal officials focus on ceremonial pomp and showcasing a warm reception, the UK government aims to secure strategic "wins" like trade deals and technology partnerships. However, fears persist that Trump could be drawn into domestic controversies, potentially souring the diplomatic mood and raising questions about the visit's efficacy.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly claimed that "left-wing radicals" were responsible for the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, vowing accountability and emphasizing the re-introduction of the death penalty. While she offered no motive for the alleged suspect, Tyler Robinson, Bondi stated federal charges are expected and affirmed her confidence in FBI Director Kash Patel's handling of the investigation. This assertion aligns with the administration's pledge to target "festering violence" on the "far left," further intensifying the highly politicized narrative surrounding Kirk's death and calling for national unity amidst deep division.</p>

Cramer acknowledges setbacks, such as past government scrutiny, but believes these companies are uniquely positioned for future growth, making them compelling investments.

          <p>A new survey reveals that almost one in four UK healthcare staff in NHS dementia services feel unable to provide optimal care, with fewer than a third believing current diagnostic processes are fit for purpose. Alzheimer’s Research UK warns that the system is failing to keep pace with the nearly one million people living with dementia, over a third of whom lack a formal diagnosis. Carers report long waits for help and diagnosis, with one in five waiting over two years. This prompts calls for faster GP referrals and treatment plans within 18 weeks, highlighting the urgent need for systemic improvement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed that U.S. companies switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a move the SEC is actively investigating. Trump argues this change would save money, allow managers to focus on long-term strategy, and align with other countries like China's longer-term views. While some financial experts support reducing short-term focus, critics warn that less frequent reporting could diminish transparency and timely information for investors. The proposal could be enacted by the SEC without Congressional support, but raises concerns about market integrity and investor access to critical data. (not investment advice)</p>

This research is part of broader efforts to identify and combat pollution sources, with city officials hopeful it will lead to improvements for the popular beach.

The expert warned that such language, increasingly popular online, normalizes abuse, injustice, and discrimination, potentially leading to violence.
