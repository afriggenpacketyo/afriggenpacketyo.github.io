          <p>Hims & Hers Health saw a 5% stock increase after announcing the addition of Eli Lilly's weight-loss medications, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to its platform.

The company projects at least $725 million in annual revenue from weight-loss offerings, excluding compounded semaglutide.

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to cut the IRS workforce by half is projected to result in substantial revenue losses, potentially reaching trillions of dollars over the next decade.  Reduced staffing limits the agency's ability to collect taxes and enforce regulations, while potentially encouraging tax evasion.  This follows a history of IRS budget cuts leading to significant revenue losses.  The move raises concerns about the long-term fiscal health of the nation and the fairness of the tax system. <br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>
