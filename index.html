          <p>A catastrophic landslide in Sudan's Darfur region has reportedly killed over 1,000 people and completely leveled a village, according to a rebel group controlling the area. This tragic event occurred on Sunday in Tarasin, within the Marra Mountains, following days of incessant rain, with only one survivor identified. The disaster severely exacerbates the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Sudan, which is in its third year of a deadly civil war and facing famine in parts of Darfur. The rebel group has urgently appealed to the United Nations and international aid agencies for assistance in the critical recovery of victims' bodies and to address the dire scarcity of food and medication in the affected area.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.2 billion for Monday night's drawing, marking the fifth-largest prize ever in the game's history, with an estimated cash value of $498.4 million. This surge follows no winner in Saturday's $1 billion drawing, though nine tickets matched five white balls to win $1 million, and three Power Play tickets won $2 million. No one has claimed the jackpot since May 31, contributing to its massive growth. The next opportunity to win this life-changing sum will be in Wednesday's drawing, with tickets available across 45 states and other U.S. territories.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre have developed a compact, detergent-free washing machine designed to address the challenges of laundry in space, where water is a scarce resource. This cube-shaped device, slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase and weighing 12kg, utilizes only 400ml of water per cycle, delivered as an ultra-fine mist through ultrasonic atomization. Instead of traditional detergent, the machine employs ultraviolet light to produce ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes clothes for up to five wears. This innovation represents a significant step towards more sustainable and comfortable long-duration space travel.</p>

The incident occurred shortly after he had stopped to assist an alleged victim of domestic violence. Police are investigating the crash, and Giuliani was released from the hospital on Monday, highlighting a dramatic weekend for the former mayor known for his leadership during 9/11 and his later role as an advisor to Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded with mixed results as investors closely monitored the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting of leaders in Tianjin and weighed the impact of new tariff concerns. This uncertainty was heightened by a recent U.S. federal appeals court ruling that declared most of former President Donald Trump's global tariffs illegal. India's markets were particularly scrutinized after Trump stated India offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. imports to zero, criticizing the existing "one sided" trade relationship. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 experienced a decline, reflecting diverse regional responses to these geopolitical and economic developments.</p>

          <p>Historic cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits have commenced, profoundly altering how over 40 million low-income Americans will purchase groceries.

          <p>The UK Justice Department has announced new plans that will grant the Justice Secretary the authority to veto any future changes to sentencing guidelines proposed by the independent Sentencing Council. This measure, to be introduced as part of the Sentencing Bill, ensures that new guidelines cannot be issued without explicit approval from both the Justice Secretary and the Lady Chief Justice. The reform follows a public dispute earlier this year over proposed guidance concerning pre-sentence reports for minority offenders. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasized that policy must be democratically set by parliamentarians, ensuring greater oversight of the Council's work.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an "extraordinary" temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's plan to deport unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without formal deportation orders, just as flights were prepared for takeoff. Lawyers argued these deportations would bypass legal protections under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, potentially exposing minors to abuse or persecution. This article highlights the judicial intervention that forced the deplaning of 76 children slated for return, underscoring the ongoing legal battle over the treatment and rights of migrant minors in U.S. custody, and the government's claim of seeking reunification with families abroad.</p>

          <p>The Met Office predicts a "decent chance" that the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, will be visible across much of the UK in the coming days, potentially extending as far south as the Midlands.

This article advises those with clear, dark skies to look out, suggesting Monday night offers the best viewing opportunity, though visibility depends on factors like cloud cover and light pollution.
