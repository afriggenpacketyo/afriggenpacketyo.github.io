          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has issued a strong call for universities to actively combat the rising tide of antisemitism and ensure the safety of Jewish students on campuses. Phillipson highlighted an "unacceptable increase in antisemitism," noting that many Jewish students currently do not feel secure in their academic environments. In response, the government is providing funding for training programs aimed at helping university staff and students identify and address harassment and hate. Additionally, a £4 million fund will support projects promoting interfaith understanding and combating online misinformation, alongside £2 million for Holocaust education in secondary schools. This article underscores the urgent need for action to protect vulnerable students and foster a more inclusive campus climate.</p>

          <p>Amidst the ongoing US government shutdown, hundreds of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees who were mistakenly issued layoff notices have been reinstated. The Trump administration had initiated staff reductions across various agencies, but a spokesman confirmed that approximately 700 of the 1,300 CDC workers initially affected were notified of their re-employment. However, Vice-President JD Vance cautioned that more significant cuts could still be ahead if the shutdown persists, as Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked over budget disputes, particularly regarding federal healthcare subsidies.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study from UC Irvine has revealed the intricate mechanism by which dietary fiber protects the body from the detrimental effects of sugar. Researchers discovered that inulin, a naturally occurring fiber found in vegetables like onions, garlic, and artichokes, actively reshapes gut bacteria in the small intestine. These modified microbes then efficiently metabolize fructose before it can reach the liver, effectively preventing fat buildup and related damage. Published in Nature Metabolism, these findings offer a new level of protection against metabolic harm and suggest potential strategies for reversing fatty liver disease. This article highlights a significant scientific breakthrough with promising implications for public health.</p>

          <p>China's government has vehemently accused the US of "double standards" in response to President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, warning that Beijing could introduce its own unspecified "countermeasures." A commerce ministry spokesperson declared China is "not afraid" of a potential trade war, criticizing US export restrictions on chips while defending its own rare earths controls as legitimate national security measures. Although Trump later adopted a more conciliatory tone, stating, "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!", this article highlights the escalating rhetoric and persistent underlying tensions in the US-China trade relationship, which has already rattled global financial markets.
