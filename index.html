          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following reports suggesting the journal selects articles based on authors' race rather than merit. This action escalates an ongoing dispute between the administration and Harvard, which includes a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants due to antisemitism concerns. The civil rights offices of the Education and Health and Human Services departments will conduct the investigations into potential violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically regarding journal membership and article selection policies.</p>

          <p>The FDA's decision to potentially require a new clinical trial for Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine has raised concerns about the approval process for updated vaccines. This action follows disagreements within the FDA and the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a key health position, leading to questions about political influence on vaccine policies. Experts worry that stricter requirements could delay the availability of updated COVID-19 vaccines, similar to concerns surrounding the flu shot, and potentially open the agency up to lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserted that border agents are experiencing a "night and day difference" at the U.S.-Mexico border compared to a year ago. She attributes this improvement to the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, leading to a significant drop in illegal crossings. Customs and Border Protection reported the lowest level of illegal border crossings ever recorded in March, marking a 95% decrease from the previous year.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism towards a Minnesota school district's argument requiring students with disabilities to prove "bad faith" on the part of the school in order to claim discrimination. A family argued that federal law requires only "deliberate indifference," a lower standard, to prove inadequate accommodations. Disability rights groups are concerned that accepting the school district's argument would make it more difficult for Americans with disabilities to successfully challenge discrimination in court.</p>
