          <p>David Huerta, the California president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), was arrested for allegedly obstructing federal officers during a protest against an immigration raid in Los Angeles. The criminal complaint alleges that Huerta shouted expletives, banged on a gate to intimidate federal agents, and refused to move when asked by officers. Some union leaders and Democratic U.S. House members have criticized the arrest, viewing it as an attempt to intimidate protesters and criminalize peaceful demonstrations. Huerta, who has been an advocate for workers and immigrants in Southern California for decades, was released on bond and is scheduled for arraignment in July. The focus remains on the immigrants detained by federal officers, highlighting the ongoing tension between immigration enforcement and community activism. The situation underscores the complexities of balancing law enforcement with the rights to protest, while advocating for immigrant rights within a politically charged environment. </p>

          <p>An undocumented Mexican immigrant, Ramon Morales-Reyes, who was detained after being falsely accused of threatening President Donald Trump, has been granted a $7,500 bond by a Chicago Immigration Court judge. Judge Carla Espinoza cited that she does not believe Morales-Reyes poses a danger to the community while awaiting removal proceedings. While Morales-Reyes has prior arrests, he only has one conviction for disorderly conduct. The Department of Homeland Security stated that while the immigrant is no longer under investigation for threats, he is in the country illegally with previous arrests for felony hit and run, criminal damage to property, and disorderly conduct with domestic abuse. This case highlights the complexities of immigration law and the potential for individuals to be caught in legal battles due to false accusations. </p>

          <p>Sadie Novotny is suing Costco for millions of dollars, claiming she sustained severe injuries after a heavy liquor cabinet fell on her at a Santa Rosa Costco store. The lawsuit alleges that Novotny suffered a closed head injury, leading to ongoing difficulties with word recall, vision problems, and headaches. Novotny claims Costco acted negligently by failing to address dangerous conditions and adequately train employees to maintain merchandise. Costco has not yet responded to requests for comment, and the case has been moved to the U.S. District Court for Northern California. The case underscores the responsibility of retailers to ensure customer safety within their stores, and highlights the potential consequences of negligence in maintaining safe environments for shoppers. </p>

While rates are down two percentage points from a record 23.37%, they are still at 21.37%. Experts suggest that rates could continue to decline gradually throughout the year as the Federal Reserve considers rate cuts. However, waiting for significant rate relief may not be the best strategy, and cardholders should explore debt relief options such as credit card debt forgiveness, debt management programs, or balance transfer credit cards.

          <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that taking full control of Hulu will unlock new growth opportunities for the company, especially with enhanced bundling capabilities. Disney is set to finalize its acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu by July 24, paying an additional $438.7 million. With complete control, Disney plans to integrate Hulu content fully into the Disney+ app, creating a seamless experience for consumers and saving operational costs. Iger emphasizes that bundling will increase engagement, provide greater advertising opportunities, lower churn, and reduce customer acquisition costs, ultimately boosting overall margins.

Time spent on gaming consoles showed particularly strong links to emotional problems.

          <h2>California Seeks Restraining Order to Block National Guard and Marine Deployments in Los Angeles</h2>

          <p>California has requested a restraining order from a federal court to block the deployment of National Guard forces and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, amid widespread protests over federal immigration enforcement efforts. Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta argue that President Trump has exceeded his authority by deploying military forces without the state's consent. They contend that the deployment is unnecessary, adds to tensions, and violates the U.S. Constitution. The state is seeking an immediate halt to the deployments, arguing that they create imminent harm to state sovereignty and escalate civil unrest. </p>
