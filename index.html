          <p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha lauded the new Champions League format, emphasizing the exciting and unpredictable nature of the group stage. He highlighted that teams played each other only once, reducing the pressure of individual results and allowing lesser teams to compete with more energy. Journalist Nicky Bandini noted that the format benefitted PSG, allowing them to develop throughout the season, ultimately leading to their victory. The new format allowed for real-time observation of team development and the importance of finding form at the right time, as PSG demonstrated. The article suggests the format's success lies in its ability to foster competitive balance and provide opportunities for teams to evolve throughout the tournament.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, may be vulnerable to hacking due to minor time delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers, compromising the satellite's quantum key distribution (QKD) system. The researcher, Alexander Miller, analyzed communication data between a ground station and Micius, revealing that the distribution of quantum keys from the satellite was insecure. This raises concerns about the security of China's quantum communication network, which relies on the satellite's performance.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated fellow British player Jacob Fearnley in the French Open third round, in a match disrupted by fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium. Norrie won 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, securing a spot in the last 16 where he will face Novak Djokovic. The constant noise from the fireworks proved challenging for both players, but Norrie's experience allowed him to maintain control. With Jack Draper also advancing, this marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the French Open last 16.</p>
