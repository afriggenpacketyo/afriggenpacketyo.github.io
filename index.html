          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied the Justice Department's petition to release grand jury records from the 2000s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The judge cited binding precedent from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, stating her court lacks the authority to unseal the records for the reasons provided, such as public interest. This ruling does not impact separate requests in New York concerning later investigations into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, where a different legal standard for disclosure may apply.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has finalized the signing of French striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt for an initial fee of £69 million. The 23-year-old successfully passed a medical exam and has agreed to personal terms, pushing Liverpool's total summer spending beyond £250 million. Ekitike had a successful season in the Bundesliga, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists, which attracted interest from multiple top clubs. His arrival at Liverpool follows a career resurgence at Frankfurt after a challenging period at Paris St-Germain, where he struggled for consistent playing time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The opening day of the fourth Test between England and India was significantly impacted by an injury to Indian wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant, who retired hurt after being struck on the foot. Before his departure, Pant was building a crucial partnership and playing in his characteristically aggressive style. His absence, combined with key wickets taken by England's Ben Stokes, left the match finely balanced, with India finishing the day on 264-4. The outcome of Pant's scan could be pivotal for the remainder of the match and the series.</p>

It also aims to reduce regulatory hurdles, including removing DEI requirements from the CHIPS Act, and create AI export packages for U.S. allies to compete with nations like China.</p>

          <p>Researchers at UC Berkeley have developed a groundbreaking at-home diagnostic test that utilizes the "coffee ring effect," the scientific phenomenon explaining why spilled coffee dries in a ring. This innovative method is reportedly up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests, capable of detecting biomarkers for diseases like COVID-19, sepsis, and prostate cancer. The test provides results in about twelve minutes by concentrating disease proteins into a visible, light-reactive ring, potentially revolutionizing personal health monitoring and making early detection more accessible.</p>

With average home equity loan rates around 8.3%, compared to over 12.6% for personal loans, the monthly savings are substantial. For example, on a 15-year term, a borrower could save approximately $265 per month, which amounts to over $47,000 in interest over the life of the loan.

          <p>A new political conflict is brewing over congressional redistricting, as Texas Republicans are proposing to redraw their state's maps mid-decade to gain an electoral advantage for the 2026 midterms. This unusual move, prompted by President Trump's desire for a larger House majority, is forcing Democrats to consider retaliatory measures in states they control. However, Democrats face significant hurdles, including independent redistricting commissions and state laws in places like California and New York, as well as internal reluctance to bend established norms for political gain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent congressional watchdog, has determined that the Trump administration violated federal law by withholding funds appropriated for the Head Start program. The report states that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) illegally impounded the funds by significantly slowing down their disbursement between January and April 2025. According to the GAO, this action violates the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which is designed to prevent the executive branch from unilaterally refusing to spend money allocated by Congress.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division. Revenue from games like Magic: The Gathering and the mobile hit Monopoly Go! grew 16%, offsetting a 16% decline in the company's traditional consumer products segment. The toy business continues to face headwinds from retailer order timing and the impact of tariffs. Despite a net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment, the company raised its full-year guidance based on its gaming success.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. This move, aimed at boosting the housing market, would remove the tax currently levied on profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for married couples. While the idea has been introduced in Congress and is supported by groups like the National Association of Realtors, experts suggest it could be costly and that a more likely outcome might be an increase in the exemption thresholds rather than a full elimination.

          <p>This article analyzes the political maneuvering of Senator Josh Hawley, who, after vocally opposing Medicaid cuts as "morally wrong," ultimately voted for a GOP bill that included them. Hawley justified his vote by citing other wins in the bill, such as tax cut extensions. He then immediately introduced new legislation to repeal some of the very cuts he had just helped enact, a move Democrats have called a cynical attempt to mislead voters. This "political pretzel gymnastics" highlights the pressure on Republicans to support President Trump's agenda, even when it conflicts with their stated populist principles.</p>

          <p>A massive high-pressure system, known as a heat dome, is currently causing dangerous and prolonged high temperatures for over 160 million Americans. This weather phenomenon works by trapping sinking air, which compresses and heats up, while also preventing cloud formation and thus increasing solar radiation. The effect is amplified by high humidity, making it harder for the human body to cool down. Climate change is making these events more frequent and intense, with warmer nights offering little respite and increasing the health risks associated with extreme heat.</p>
