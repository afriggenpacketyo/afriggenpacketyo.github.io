          <p>Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy outlined the Democratic position on the ongoing government shutdown, attributing the stalemate to Republicans' refusal to negotiate. He argued that Republicans are prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy over preventing a 75% increase in healthcare premiums for many Americans. Murphy also commented on the recent Gaza ceasefire, expressing relief for the hostage release but criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for delaying a peace deal for political reasons. He stressed that continued US pressure on Israel is necessary to ensure a lasting resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

He shared that he was initially hesitant to continue the character after the original show's cancellation but felt a responsibility to the loyal fanbase.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" by refusing to fund the government without concessions on healthcare policy. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Vance asserted that the administration is open to negotiating on health insurance tax credits but will not do so while the government remains shut down. He placed the blame for the impasse squarely on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and what he termed "far-left Democrats." The shutdown has led to layoff notices for over 4,000 federal workers, a situation Vance described as chaotic but a direct consequence of Democratic actions.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders appeared perplexed upon learning the school could face a $50,000 fine from the Big 12 Conference after fans rushed the field. The celebration followed the Buffaloes' 24-17 victory over No. 22 Iowa State, ending a losing streak against ranked opponents. Sanders expressed his support for the fans' enthusiastic display, stating he loves to see the students celebrate on the field. The potential fine comes after the university was recently penalized for a separate incident involving inappropriate conduct toward a visiting team, highlighting the conference's stricter enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>A powerful nor'easter moving up the East Coast has led New Jersey to declare a state of emergency, with forecasts predicting significant coastal flooding, flash floods, and winds up to 60 mph. The storm is expected to impact areas from North Carolina to New England, with New York City also under a coastal flood warning. Authorities are particularly concerned about the potential for major flooding and beach erosion along the Jersey Shore. The severe weather has already caused flight delays and cancellations at major airports, and utility companies have mobilized additional workers to address anticipated power outages.</p>

          <p>The office of Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced that an illegal attempt to seize power is underway, following escalating anti-government protests. A specific army unit, CAPSAT, which was instrumental in Rajoelina's 2009 rise to power, has claimed control over the military command. The unrest began with demonstrations against utility cuts but has grown into a broader movement against corruption, unemployment, and the high cost of living. Protesters have successfully gathered in the capital's main square, a symbolic victory for the movement, as the political situation in the island nation remains highly volatile.</p>

The group has reportedly apprehended individuals accused of collaborating with Israel and has been involved in clashes with rival clans challenging its authority. This reassertion of power occurs alongside unresolved questions about the future of security and governance in the territory. The US-brokered peace plan calls for the demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of an International Stabilization Force, but the implementation of such a plan remains a major logistical and political challenge.</p>

These deployments, part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan, have led to incidents of aggressive tactics, including a recent shooting in Chicago and confrontational sweeps in Los Angeles. Critics argue that Border Patrol agents, trained for border interdiction, are ill-suited for civil immigration enforcement in urban communities and may be violating constitutional protections against arbitrary stops and searches. This expansion utilizes a statute allowing warrantless searches within 100 miles of any US border.</p>

The article argues that the responsibility for this issue lies not with the AI tools themselves, but with employers who fail to provide proper training, establish clear policies, and develop a strategic plan for AI implementation.

The film aims for stark realism, exploring the human and procedural elements of a nightmare scenario where the President must make an impossible decision. To ensure authenticity, Bigelow worked with military consultants, including a retired general who once commanded a missile defense base. The film highlights a concerning reality: a real-world president would likely have little to no practical training for such a crisis, a point reinforced by the film's advisors.</p>

These include rescuing children from every struggle, modeling perfection, silencing their emotions, and prizing achievement over effort. To raise resilient children, parents should instead allow them to face age-appropriate challenges, apologize for their own mistakes, and validate their child's feelings. The article emphasizes that building mental fortitude involves teaching kids to regulate emotions, trust themselves, and rebound from setbacks within a secure and loving home environment.</p>

Muttaqi claimed that female education is not forbidden by Islam but has been "postponed" by order of the supreme leader. This event followed an earlier press conference from which women journalists were excluded, an act Muttaqi dismissed as a "technical issue." Afghanistan remains the only country where the government has systematically barred women and girls from most aspects of public life, including secondary and university education.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the recent appointment of conservative provocateur Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is the culmination of a 50-year strategy to shift media coverage to be more favorable to corporate power. The plan originated with the 1971 Powell Memo, which called on corporations to monitor and influence news networks to counter criticism of the free enterprise system. Documents reportedly show that top executives at CBS and other media giants were part of a task force to implement these ideas. The authors contend that decades of media deregulation and consolidation have realized this vision, eroding accountability journalism.</p>

The charges were dropped after prosecutors claimed the government failed to provide necessary evidence designating China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. Conservatives have suggested Powell, who has advocated for closer ties with Beijing, was behind the decision not to disclose the information, a claim the government denies.</p>

The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting discrimination is valuable, despite their flaws and the author's views. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests engaging with the works critically and in community with other fans. This approach allows for continued appreciation while actively interrogating the problematic aspects of the canon, similar to how religious communities reinterpret sacred texts.</p>

At the SNP conference, delegates backed this strategy, which frames the next election as a de-facto poll on independence. However, the UK Labour government, which would need to approve a new vote, has reiterated its opposition.

The initiative also drew controversy after armed police were sent to the home of a retired veteran who sent Ingoglia a non-threatening postcard.
