          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris announced an exceptional closure, with French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati confirming that a robbery had occurred at the museum's opening. While authorities have launched an investigation, it remains unclear what, if anything, was stolen from the world-renowned institution. The minister reported that no injuries occurred during the incident and that she was on-site with museum staff and police. The museum's website simply cited "exceptional reasons" for the closure, asking for public understanding.</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians in Gaza, which would constitute a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department has informed other guarantors of the peace deal, including Egypt and Qatar, and stated that protective measures will be taken if the attack proceeds. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed groups in the region, highlighting the fragile and tense security situation following Israel's partial withdrawal.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has successfully struck and caused a fire at a major gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region, approximately 1,700 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. This attack is part of Ukraine's escalating strategy since August to target Russian energy infrastructure, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies and reduce Moscow's war funding. The strike follows a series of overnight drone exchanges between the two nations and comes as diplomatic reports suggest Russian President Putin may have moderated territorial demands in a call with President Trump.</p>

The claims, published in the Mail on Sunday and The Sunday Telegraph, suggest he provided an officer with her date of birth and social security number. This development follows Andrew's decision to relinquish his titles, including Duke of York, as he continues to face scrutiny over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the allegations made by Giuffre.</p>

          <p>The Chinese division of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has openly defied its parent company, instructing employees to ignore directives from the head office in the Netherlands. In a letter, Nexperia China declared itself an "independent" entity and asserted that local management is now in control of all China-based operations, including its Dongguan plant and various branches. This act of rebellion marks a significant escalation in the struggle for control between Dutch authorities and Nexperia's Chinese owner, Wingtech Technology, which acquired the firm in 2019.</p>

          <p>An Ohio man, Connor Weston, was arrested after he stormed the stage at a Wikipedia conference in New York City, brandished a gun, and threatened to take his own life. Weston, who wore a sign identifying himself as an "anti-contact non-offending pedophile," was tackled by two conference safety team members before he could harm himself or others. The incident, which led to the cancellation of the day's events, ended without any injuries. Weston now faces charges of criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, have recently announced significant job cuts, publicly citing the integration of artificial intelligence as a primary driver for increased efficiency. However, some industry experts and critics argue that AI is being used as a convenient excuse to justify layoffs that may stem from other business challenges, such as overhiring during the pandemic. Research from institutions like Yale University and the New York Fed suggests that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption, indicating that the technology may be a scapegoat rather than the root cause of the current downsizing trend.

The investigation was significantly aided by a 2016 BBC Scotland programme that used secret filming to expose the fraudulent practices of the company Sell My Timeshare (SMT). The firm used high-pressure tactics to trick elderly victims into buying useless "credits" instead of helping them exit their contracts, funding a lavish lifestyle for its owners.

His absence has forced tactical compromises, such as new signing Florian Wirtz playing deeper, which limits his attacking effectiveness and exposes vulnerabilities that opponents could exploit.</p>

          <h2>Psychologists Explain Why Sexual Desire Often Wanes in Long-Term Relationships</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists and sexologists are exploring why sexual frequency often decreases in long-term relationships, attributing it to hormonal shifts where bonding hormones like oxytocin suppress sex drive hormones over time. Communication about sexual needs is crucial, as unmet needs can lead to sexual distress and lower libido, particularly for women. Research highlights a "gender orgasm gap" and suggests that factors like prioritizing female pleasure and maintaining physical affection, such as cuddling post-intercourse, can significantly improve both sexual and overall relationship satisfaction for couples.</p>

          <p>Protests in downtown Los Angeles, part of the nationwide 'No Kings Day' demonstrations, escalated when police declared an unlawful assembly near the Metropolitan Detention Center. Tense standoffs occurred as demonstrators converged on the federal facility to protest immigration policies. The LAPD deployed tear gas, nonlethal rounds, and mounted police to disperse the crowds after issuing a dispersal order. The evening's events marked a sharp contrast to the peaceful daytime rallies that had taken place earlier across the city.</p>

          <p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather events are placing significant stress on the United Kingdom's native trees, with species like oak experiencing decline due to heat and drought. In response, Forestry England has released a list of thirty tree species, including both native and non-native varieties like coast redwood and Corsican pine, that are better suited to thrive in a warmer future climate. This strategy, known as assisted migration, aims to create more diverse and resilient forests capable of adapting to the rapid pace of climate change.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has announced plans for a new "T-Dome" missile shield, described as a multilayered air defense network to protect the island's critical infrastructure and population centers from potential attacks by Beijing. The proposal, which appears to draw inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome, aims to be accelerated through increased defense spending and advanced technologies like AI. However, the announcement surprised Taiwan's own defense establishment, as the project was not mentioned in the latest defense report and has no allocated funding in the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi is expected to become Japan's first female prime minister after her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) reportedly agreed to form a coalition with the opposition Japan Innovation Party. This new alliance provides the necessary support for Takaichi's premiership following the recent collapse of the LDP's long-standing coalition with the Komeito party, which had thrown the country into political uncertainty. The formal agreement is anticipated to be signed on Monday, securing Takaichi enough votes in parliament to be elected to the nation's top office.</p>
