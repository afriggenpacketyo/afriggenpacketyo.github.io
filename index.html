          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei could end the conflict between the two nations, dismissing concerns it would escalate the situation. Netanyahu accused Iran of spreading terrorism and pursuing nuclear weapons, asserting Israel's actions are preventing a nuclear war. He emphasized the importance of U.S. support in eliminating Iran's nuclear program, framing it as a battle of good against evil. Netanyahu also dismissed reports of Iran seeking to end hostilities and resume negotiations, claiming they are insincere attempts to advance their nuclear ambitions. The State Department has classified all of Israel and the West Bank as "Level 4: Do Not Travel"—its highest advisory level.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing conflict, Israel has warned hundreds of thousands of residents in Tehran to evacuate as it continues strikes against Iranian targets. The Israeli military claims Iran is deliberately targeting civilians, while Israel is focusing on military infrastructure. Iran has vowed further retaliation for Israeli attacks, which it says have killed hundreds in Iran. The fighting has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran, with the U.S. denying involvement in Israel's actions. The situation remains tense as both sides exchange fire, resulting in casualties and damage on both sides, and the State Department has issued a directive to all American embassies and consular posts to relay or reiterate to their host governments that the U.S. "is not involved in Israel's unilateral action against targets in Iran and did not provide tanker support."</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. Trump has described the deal as a "partnership" rather than a merger, while U.S. Steel has confirmed it will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. The transaction is expected to be completed promptly, pending customary closing conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York state proposal to reduce plastic waste is facing opposition from the oil and petrochemical lobby, which argues it will disproportionately harm people of color. Advocates and assembly sources are calling this claim misleading, citing evidence that the plastic supply chain poses health risks to Black and brown communities. The bill aims to reduce plastic packaging by 30% in 12 years and boost recycling rates, funded by fees on large businesses. Opponents claim the legislation will raise food prices, but advocates argue this is a manipulative tactic to protect corporate profits, as garbage incinerators and plastic production facilities are often located in communities of color, causing toxic pollution.</p>

          <p>Despite Iran's larger population and military size, Israel's sophisticated military has allowed it to overpower its enemy. Israel claims to have gained control over the skies over Tehran, with modern, U.S.-made fighters able to drop guided bombs from short range. While Iran has launched missiles into Israel, the Israeli military says it has destroyed a third of Iran's surface to surface launchers. Iran's allies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, have had their ability to threaten Israel greatly diminished by Israeli action over the last two years, but Iran still has the ability to disrupt shipping lanes and strike western interests in the region.</p>

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey found that authorities have avoided addressing the ethnicity of perpetrators in grooming gangs. The report indicated that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang perpetrators, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions at a national level. However, local data from three police forces suggest a disproportionate number of suspects have Asian ethnic backgrounds. The report criticized the authorities' failure to understand the nature and scale of the problem, prompting Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to announce a new national inquiry and other measures to address the issue, such as ensuring adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 "face the most serious charge of sexual assault" instead of lesser charges.</p>

Conflicting reports have surfaced over the years regarding Tice's status, and his family has expressed doubt about the accuracy of Hassan's account.

          <p>JJ Spaun won the U.S. Open at Oakmont, holing out from 65ft on the final green, providing an upbeat end to a tournament defined by chaos and carnage. The course setup was extremely difficult, with dense rough and slick greens, leading to a situation where luck became too influential. Adam Scott labeled the course “borderline unplayable,” and many other players privately questioned the fairness of the conditions. While Spaun's victory was celebrated, the overall event raised concerns about the balance between challenge and fairness in major championships.</p>

          <p>A majority of Canadians do not want the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to prioritize investing in Canada over maximizing returns, according to a new survey. Seventy-two percent of respondents believe the CPPIB should invest wherever it earns the most returns for Canadians. Support for the fund investing more in Canada is highest among people aged 18 to 24, with 39 percent in favor. The CPPIB's primary goal is to maximize long-term investment returns without undue risk, and it had assets of $714.4 billion as of the end of March.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic published an opinion piece examining President Trump's use of military force against political opposition, arguing that it aligns with historical definitions of tyranny. The author contends that Trump's actions, such as deploying the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to suppress protests against immigration policies, represent a departure from democratic norms. The article also highlights the use of Cold War rhetoric and the term "Third World" to describe multicultural communities, suggesting a dehumanization of those targeted by the administration's policies. The piece concludes by questioning whether those serving in the military are aware of becoming instruments of tyranny.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports has released its latest recommendations for the best sunscreens to protect against sun damage. The report highlights that sunscreen should be worn year-round, not just in the summer months, to shield skin from harmful rays. Lotion sunscreens are preferred because it is easier to see how much is being applied, with a teaspoon advised for each body part. The report also advises choosing sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher, and applying 15-30 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying every two hours after swimming or sweating.</p>

          <p>Taking out a $1,000 payday loan can result in significant costs due to high fees and interest rates, potentially trapping borrowers in a cycle of debt. Payday loans typically charge a flat fee per $100 borrowed, which can quickly add up to a nearly 400% APR when annualized. Borrowers who roll over their loans due to inability to repay face additional fees, further increasing the total cost. It is advisable to explore safer alternatives to avoid the long-term financial consequences of payday loans. (not investment advice)</p>
