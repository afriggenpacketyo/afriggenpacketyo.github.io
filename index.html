          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 1,000 points, fueled by optimism surrounding potential de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war and reassurance regarding Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's position. President Trump signaled potential tariff reductions on Chinese goods, while China has imposed high levies on American goods, with tariffs totaling 125%. The market's positive reaction underscores the sensitivity to trade relations and monetary policy, however some analysts warn the rally's durability is questionable given Trump's volatile rhetoric. Tesla stock also saw a notable increase after Elon Musk announced scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has levied fines totaling €700 million on Apple and Meta for alleged violations of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aimed at curbing the power of big tech companies. Apple faces a €500 million fine over its App Store policies, while Meta is fined €200 million regarding user consent for data collection. The EU asserts Apple was in breach of this by not freely offering alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers. Meta's fine is over the choices it offered on data collection. Meta introduced a "consent or pay" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.</p>

The incident occurred in October 2021 when a group of paddleboarders, led by Lloyd and a co-instructor, encountered hazardous conditions on the Western Cleddau river. Lloyd pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour, and the court heard there had been heavy rain in the days before and "the river was in flood conditions" with a "visibly strong current". The judge criticized the "abysmal" approach to health and safety during her sentencing remarks.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price is on the rise, heading toward $95,000, marking its third consecutive day of gains. This increase is attributed to a broad relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and reduced criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency has recovered about half of its losses since Inauguration Day and is hovering just under the flat line for the year. Market analysts suggest this surge reflects investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset that serves as a portfolio diversifier and hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Unite union has agreed to mediation talks with Acas next week to try to settle the ongoing bin strike in Birmingham. A deal could now be "in touching distance", the union said, but it accused the city council of "saying one thing in public and another in the negotiations". The all-out strike by Unite members over plans to downgrade some refuse workers, who could lose thousands of pounds a year each, started on 11 March. The strike, now in its seventh week, has led to a major incident being declared amid concerns for public health and the environment.</p>

As the US President lambasts America’s allies and foes alike with steep additional tariffs , the Western alliance is fractured, affording China a chance to kick its way out of the geopolitical box Biden had built around it. This shift presents an opportunity for China to strengthen its position amid weakened transatlantic relations. Leaders in Europe are beginning to view the alliance with America as dead.</p>

          <p>A report from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) warns that nuclear power stations worldwide are increasingly vulnerable to attack following Russia's capture of the Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine. The report highlights the growing risk of targeting nuclear sites in conflicts, raising concerns about the potential for nuclear threats without the use of nuclear weapons. The “dual-use” status of nuclear power stations – meaning they qualify as both civilian facilities and military targets – has caused deep concern. The report undermines proposals being considered by the Trump administration to take control of the Zaporizhzhia power plant (ZPP) as part of a plan to end the war.</p>
