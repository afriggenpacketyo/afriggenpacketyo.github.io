        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has officially ended the "de minimis" tariff exemption for low-value imports, effective Friday, a significant move by the Trump administration to close what it termed a "catastrophic loophole." This exemption previously allowed parcels valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. tax-free, but officials contended it was exploited to evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products into the country. The change, now applying to all nations after initially targeting China and Hong Kong, is projected to generate up to $10 billion annually in tariff revenues and substantially restrict the flow of dangerous prohibited items. A six-month transition period is in place, allowing postal service shippers to pay a flat duty before full ad valorem rates are universally applied.</p>

          <p>Famed Australian crocodile wrangler Matt Wright has been found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice, including lying to police and pressuring a hospitalized witness, following a fatal helicopter crash in 2022. The former Netflix star's friend and co-star, Chris "Willow" Wilson, died when the aircraft, used for crocodile egg harvesting, ran out of fuel and crashed. Prosecutors successfully argued that Wright attempted to tamper with evidence, specifically by lying about fuel levels and asking the injured pilot to falsify flight records, out of fear of being blamed. Wright has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers intend to appeal the verdict, which was delivered on his 46th birthday.</p>

          <p>UK firms are voicing significant concern and warning of potential chaos following the termination of the U.S. "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed low-value parcels under $800 to enter tax-free. This new policy, effective Friday, means parcels will now be subject to tariffs, pushing up costs and creating substantial barriers for small British businesses trying to compete internationally. Many companies, such as hand-dyed wool seller Nellie and Eve, have already halted U.S. shipments due to the uncertainty of upfront costs for customers. Industry bodies like the Federation of Small Businesses are calling for government support, as a typical $100 order could incur an additional $30 to $50 in costs, severely impacting smaller enterprises.</p>

          <p>European leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have expressed profound outrage after Russian missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 23 people, including four children, and significantly damaged the EU's delegation office. Ukrainian forces reported a massive bombardment involving nearly 600 drones and over 30 ballistic and cruise missiles, marking the deadliest attack on the capital in months. The strikes, which also hit a residential building and the British Council, came after U.S.-led diplomatic efforts for peace, prompting strong condemnations from UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Von der Leyen announced a forthcoming 19th package of sanctions on Russia, signaling a firm European response.</p>

Despite a largely negative week influenced by French political drama and chip giant Nvidia's earnings, the regional Stoxx 600 index is still poised to record its first back-to-back positive month since the year began. Corporate news includes Remy Cointreau reducing its projected operating profit impact from U.S. tariffs after a new trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully unveiled and tested a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone that bears a striking resemblance to the enigmatic "Gimbal" unidentified flying object (UFO) spotted by U.S. Navy pilots in 2015. This new experimental aircraft features a radical aerodynamic design centered around an elliptical, ring-like wing that seamlessly integrates a straight central section, forming an almost toroidal closed-loop structure. Unlike most conventional drones, its four rotors are mounted at the junctions of the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers, serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements. This development, nearly a decade after the "Gimbal" footage was declassified, represents a significant shift in uncrewed flight technology, aiming to improve endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility.</p>

Despite this impressive growth, Cambricon explicitly stated that its stock price might be deviating from its current fundamentals, posing substantial risks for investors participating in trading.

The incident occurred after Townsend defeated Ostapenko in the US Open second round, with Ostapenko arguing Townsend hadn't apologized for a net cord. While Townsend, an African-American player, did not personally interpret the remarks as racially motivated, she acknowledged the historical stigma of being perceived as uneducated within her community. Ostapenko, who later denied any element of racism on Instagram, faced widespread criticism for her remarks in the predominantly white sport.</p>

This initiative aims to protect youngsters from the severe, though rare, complications of the varicella virus, and significantly reduce the estimated £24 million annual loss in income and productivity due to parents taking time off work. Previously, parents typically had to pay up to £200 privately for the vaccine. Health experts and pediatricians have widely welcomed the move, emphasizing that widespread vaccination will dramatically decrease the number of chickenpox cases overall, potentially making the illness "a thing of the past."</p>

Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 posted gains, while India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming meeting with China's President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit added to the regional focus.

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, has lodged a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook. The new referral alleges misrepresentations regarding Cook's mortgage for a Cambridge, Massachusetts, condominium and two other homes in government ethics filings during her tenure as a Fed governor. This action comes as President Donald Trump is actively attempting to remove Cook from the central bank, and her lawyers have already initiated a lawsuit to block this unprecedented move. Pulte's previous referral, concerning purported false claims on mortgage applications for two properties, had already led to a DOJ criminal investigation, intensifying the political and legal pressure on Cook.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The attacker in the Minneapolis church school shooting, identified as Robin Westman, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children" and appeared to "hate all of us," according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. Westman killed eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel and ten-year-old Harper Moyski, and injured 18 other people during the tragic event. Officials revealed Westman had previously attended the church's school and left multiple anti-Catholic, anti-religious, and anti-Trump messages on weapons and in notes, leading the FBI Director Kash Patel to describe it as an act of domestic terrorism. The legally purchased firearms and the absence of any known mental health diagnoses or treatments for Westman raise profound concerns about gun violence prevention and the motivations behind such heinous crimes.</p>

His legal team argues these public pronouncements severely threaten his right to a fair trial and could irrevocably taint any conceivable jury pool. Abrego Garcia vehemently denies the gang affiliation and is currently seeking asylum in the United States.</p>

          <p>Four senior U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have announced their resignations, citing deep concerns over growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines. Their departures followed the White House's firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, who was deemed "not aligned with the President's agenda." Resigning officials, including Chief Science and Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry, detailed instances where evidence reviews were allegedly altered or withdrawn, and critical decisions were made without sufficient scientific data. They warned against the "weaponization" of public health and expressed fears that such actions would undermine public trust in vaccine recommendations and compromise the nation's ability to respond to future health threats.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is poised to deliver a judgment on the political future of suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a ruling that could trigger significant political paralysis in the nation. Paetongtarn, who has been in power for just a year, faces accusations of poor ethical standards, dishonesty, and undermining the military, stemming from a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen. If the court decides to sack her, Thailand will lack an obvious leader, just weeks after a ceasefire with Cambodia following deadly border clashes. This situation underscores a two-decade-long political struggle between the pro-royalist elites, the Thai military, and the Shinawatra political dynasty, with many previous prime ministers removed by court rulings.</p>

Kennedy Jr. This comprehensive timeline details key events, including President Trump's initial CDC director nominations, the contentious firing of Director Susan Monarez, and the departures of several senior officials citing concerns over scientific independence and the "weaponizing of public health." Kennedy's agenda has involved substantial cuts to medical research, the replacement of all members on the vaccine advisory panel, and major changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, all against a backdrop of increasing public health scrutiny and internal dissent.</p>

These positions, some offering annual salaries nearing £39,000, drew sharp criticism from Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp, who argued against providing such "perks" when the primary focus should be on deportations. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra deemed not all these roles necessary, leading to the directive. Mitie, which manages the largest immigration removal center in Europe, states its aim is to treat detainees with dignity, despite a previous report citing "worst" conditions and widespread drug use and violence at the facility.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers—Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith Jr.—who were convicted on charges related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. Judge Sheryl Lipman cited significant concerns of bias after the judge presiding over the original federal trial allegedly suggested one of the defendants was a gang member. While the officers were acquitted of the most serious charge—violating Nichols' civil rights by causing his death—their witness tampering convictions carried lengthy prison sentences. This decision follows nationwide outrage and protests over Nichols' death, and the officers' earlier acquittal on separate state charges, further complicating the pursuit of justice in this high-profile case.</p>
