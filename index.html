            <p>Seattle Mariners outfielder Victor Robles sustained a fractured shoulder after colliding with the outfield wall while making a spectacular catch during a game against the San Francisco Giants. The injury, confirmed by an MRI, is expected to sideline Robles for at least 12 weeks, with potential surgery jeopardizing his entire season. Despite concerns, Mariners executive Justin Hollander expressed optimism about Robles' recovery, but the team will closely monitor his progress. Robles was placed on the 10-day injured list following the incident, which occurred just one day after his impressive defensive play.</p>

            <p>Chinese residents in Malaysia's Forest City development are expressing growing resentment due to the lack of amenities and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the area. Louis Li, who moved from Guangzhou for his children's education, laments the absence of a supermarket and the limited number of operating shops. The 26,000-unit Forest City, located on an artificial spit of land near Johor Bahru, once thrived with shops and restaurants, but now struggles with accumulating trash and inconvenient access to basic necessities. The developer's debt situation adds to the residents' concerns about the long-term viability of the project.</p>

            <p>The offshore yuan experienced a significant drop, reaching a record low as the United States announced additional tariffs on imports from China. The Chinese currency weakened against the US dollar following the announcement of a 50% tariff increase, reflecting market turmoil and investor concerns. China's central bank allowed the yuan to depreciate, setting its daily fixing rate below a key threshold for the first time since September 2023. This move underscores the escalating trade tensions between the two economic powerhouses and their potential impact on global markets.</p>

            <p>The acting commissioner of the IRS is resigning due to a disagreement over the Treasury Department's decision to share immigrant tax data with ICE. The IRS disclosed a memorandum of understanding with DHS, allowing ICE to cross-verify immigrants' names and addresses with their IRS tax records. Treasury argues this will help secure U.S. borders and pursue criminals, while advocates claim it violates privacy laws. Tax law experts warn that IRS officials risk breaking the law by signing off on such data sharing, potentially facing criminal and civil sanctions.</p>

However, a new study indicates that access to care after the initial calls has not improved, prompting calls for increased awareness and funding.

            <p>A growing number of people in Canada, Denmark, and other countries are boycotting American products in response to President Trump's tariffs and treatment of US allies. Canadians are using apps to identify and purchase local alternatives, while Danes are canceling subscriptions to US streaming services and swapping out American products for local options. Groups dedicated to boycotting US goods have emerged in European countries, with momentum particularly strong in Denmark. While the economic impact of the boycott may be limited, it is boosting sales for many local brands in Canada.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's access to presidential events after the White House restricted the news agency in a dispute over the term "Gulf of America". Judge McFadden said the administration's restriction on AP journalists was "contrary to the First Amendment", which guarantees freedom of speech. The AP had argued that the administration violated the news agency's constitutional right to free speech by restricting access due to disagreements over its language.</p>

            <p>The State Department's decision to cut over $1.3 billion in foreign aid, including food, water, and medicine to countries like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia, has drawn sharp criticism. The World Food Programme warned that these cuts could amount to a "death sentence for millions" facing extreme hunger and starvation. The State Department claims that the cuts are due to concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups or providing cash-based assistance, which the administration is moving away from. However, critics argue that the cuts will have devastating consequences for vulnerable populations.</p>

Whistleblowers allege that large amounts of virgin palm oil, linked to deforestation, are being fraudulently relabeled as waste materials. Data suggests that Europe used more palm sludge waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than the world is thought to be able to produce. The Department for Transport is working with stakeholders to gather further information in response to these findings.</p>

            <p>As Tesla shares continue to decline, CEO Elon Musk has intensified his attacks on President Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, labeling him a "moron" and "dumber than a sack of bricks." Musk's criticism stems from Navarro's remarks about Tesla being more of a car assembler than a manufacturer. The feud reflects differing views on trade within the Trump administration, with Musk advocating for a zero-tariff situation between Europe and North America. Tesla's stock has experienced a significant drop, contributing to Musk's frustration. (not investment advice)</p>
