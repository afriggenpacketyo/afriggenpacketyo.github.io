          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, met with a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation, the first such visit in six years. Wang described the trip as an "ice-breaking journey" and emphasized that the two nations should be partners, not rivals. He urged Washington to view China objectively and maintain its political commitments regarding Taiwan, hoping the visit would help stabilize the bilateral relationship. This meeting represents a potential, albeit tentative, thaw in recent diplomatic tensions between the two global powers.</p>

This move is positioned as a gesture of support for multilateralism and free trade amidst global economic challenges. Li also spoke against decoupling, advocating for an open world economy and upholding the international system with the UN at its core.

          <p>This opinion article contends that President Trump is openly dictating to the Justice Department, creating a departure from the traditional separation between the White House and law enforcement. The author points to the firing of a federal prosecutor for not charging political opponents and the pursuit of investigations into rivals as evidence of this trend. The piece argues this sets a dangerous precedent, eroding ethical boundaries established after Watergate and potentially leading to endless cycles of political retribution. It contrasts this approach with past administrations' efforts to maintain a wall between politics and prosecution.</p>

This marks the second time in less than two months that United has experienced a significant technological glitch causing widespread disruptions.

          <p>Travelers at London's Stansted Airport encountered significant disruptions on Wednesday morning due to multiple issues. A fault in the signaling system caused the cancellation of all train services to the airport, affecting major routes and creating travel difficulties for passengers. Compounding the problem, a small fire broke out in the airport's Escape Lounge, which, while quickly extinguished, produced considerable smoke and led to temporary delays at the security checkpoint. No injuries were reported, but passengers were advised to check their flight status due to potential backlogs.</p>

          <p>European stock markets were projected to open lower following comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who stated that equity prices are "fairly highly valued." This assessment raised concerns among investors about inflated asset prices, leading to a cautious market sentiment globally.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent trade talks between the U.S. and China have been largely overshadowed by the contentious issue of TikTok's ownership, making a broader trade deal appear increasingly unlikely. While the Trump administration expresses confidence in a deal forcing parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations, Beijing has remained vague and noncommittal. China's silence on future meetings and its strategic media messaging on technological self-sufficiency suggest a calculated coolness to U.S. pressure. Analysts believe that despite positive rhetoric, the significant gap between the two sides on the TikTok issue makes a mutually agreeable resolution difficult to achieve.</p>

          <p>An electric vehicle owner has highlighted a growing trend of vandalism where thieves are cutting charging cables from homes and public stations to steal the copper inside. The owner shared footage of their own cable being cut in just 30 seconds, noting that while the value of the stolen copper is low, the cost of replacement and inconvenience is significant. The incident is part of a wider pattern of attacks on EV infrastructure, sometimes fueled by misinformation about electric vehicles. The trend is becoming more common as copper prices rise, creating a frustrating obstacle for the transition to cleaner transportation.</p>

          <p>A minor incident involving a malfunctioning escalator carrying President Trump and the first lady at the United Nations has escalated into a point of contention. The White House suggested the stoppage might have been deliberate, with the press secretary stating that if UN staff were responsible, they should be investigated. The UN, however, released a statement explaining that a safety mechanism was likely triggered inadvertently by a videographer from the U.S. delegation. President Trump later referenced the incident, along with a faulty teleprompter, as a metaphor for his view of the UN's general incompetence.</p>

          <p>Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin, is planning a significant capital raise that could value the firm at approximately $500 billion. CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed the company is "evaluating a raise from a selected group of high-profile key investors" to scale its business lines, which include AI, energy, and communications. According to reports, Tether is seeking to raise $15 to $20 billion for a small stake in the company. Such a valuation would place the crypto firm in the same league as private tech giants like SpaceX and OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The availability of two key players for the USC football team, wide receiver Ja’Kobi Lane and offensive tackle Elijah Paige, is unclear as they prepare for a conference game against Illinois. Lane, who missed the last game with an upper body injury, returned to practice, but Paige was not seen on the field. Coach Lincoln Riley declined to provide a specific update, referring to the Big Ten's official pre-game availability report. The potential absence of a star receiver and the starting left tackle could pose a significant challenge for the USC offense during a critical part of their season.</p>

          <p>A new bronze statue has been temporarily installed on the National Mall in Washington D.C., satirically celebrating the "long-lasting bond" between President Donald Trump and the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Plaques on the installation include quotes from an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, highlighting their past relationship.

          <p>This article fact-checks several inaccurate claims made by President Donald Trump during a press conference about a supposed link between Tylenol and autism. The report refutes his assertions that Amish children do not get autism or vaccines, that children receive an excessive number of "horse-sized" shots, and that Tylenol use during pregnancy or in young children is a direct cause of autism. Medical experts and scientific studies are cited to correct these claims, emphasizing that no causal link has been established and that the recommended vaccine schedule is safe and crucial for preventing serious diseases like hepatitis B in newborns.</p>

          <h2>Canadian Investigation Finds TikTok's Child Data Protection Measures Inadequate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation by Canada's privacy commissioner has concluded that TikTok's measures to prevent underage use and protect children's data are insufficient. The report found that hundreds of thousands of Canadian children under 13 use the app annually, and that the platform collected their sensitive personal information for marketing and content targeting. In response, TikTok has agreed to enhance its age-gating measures and provide clearer information about data use, though it disputes some of the investigation's findings. This probe is the latest in a series of global scrutinies of the Chinese-owned app over its impact on young users and data privacy.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's recent decennial military parade should be viewed as more than just a display of military strength. The author suggests that from a non-Western perspective, the event is a powerful declaration of national cohesion and institutional resilience, particularly relevant in a fragmented world. For observers in Hong Kong and Macau, the parade serves as a tangible symbol of the nation's destiny and collective spirit. The article posits that such displays help individuals transcend personal anxieties by creating an emotional resonance with the broader national identity and purpose.</p>

          <p>Chicago Cubs infielder Matt Shaw has defended his choice to miss a crucial game against the Cincinnati Reds to attend the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Shaw, who bonded with Kirk over their shared Christian faith, stated that attending was his duty and he has no regrets, despite the team's ongoing playoff race. The decision meant the Cubs had to play with a smaller roster, as he was ineligible for the bereavement list. While his manager and some teammates expressed understanding on a human level, the move also drew criticism for prioritizing a personal event during a critical point in the season.</p>
