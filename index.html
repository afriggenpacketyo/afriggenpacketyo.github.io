          <h2>Trump Visits Texas Flood Zone Amid Scrutiny of Disaster Response</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 13:28:19 EDT</div>

          <p>Former President Trump toured flood-ravaged central Texas, where a deluge killed over 120 people, including children at a summer camp. The visit comes as local and federal authorities face questions over the timeliness and adequacy of their warnings and response. Unlike his criticism of Democratic governors during past disasters, Trump has praised Texas's Republican Governor Greg Abbott and avoided blaming local officials for the catastrophe. This has highlighted a pattern of politicized responses to natural disasters, while questions about the future of FEMA and cuts to the National Weather Service remain.</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Weigh In on Hydration Multipliers Versus Water for Summer Heat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 13:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer temperatures rise, many are turning to "hydration multipliers" or electrolyte supplements to stay hydrated. Medical experts suggest that while plain water is sufficient for most people, these boosters can be beneficial under specific circumstances. For those engaged in intense exercise or who sweat profusely, drinks containing sodium, potassium, and magnesium can help replenish electrolytes and rehydrate the body more quickly. However, individuals with conditions like high blood pressure or kidney disease should be mindful of the high salt content in some of these products.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent works of nonfiction are re-examining the idea of American exceptionalism by drawing parallels between U.S. policies and historical events in other nations. One book highlights how Argentina's "Dirty War" offers cautionary lessons about state-sanctioned violence, finding echoes in certain U.S. government actions. Another historical analysis suggests that democratic principles like birthright citizenship were pioneered in Latin America, challenging the narrative of the U.S. as a unique beacon of democracy. These perspectives argue that the U.S. can learn from both the triumphs and tragedies of other countries.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis highlights the U.S. states where the cost of living remains highest, with California topping the list. The report considers factors like housing affordability, consumer prices, and the rapidly increasing cost of homeowner's insurance. States such as Hawaii, Florida, and New York also rank high due to soaring home prices and insurance premiums, which are exacerbated by climate-related risks like hurricanes and wildfires. This economic pressure creates significant burdens for residents, particularly for low and moderate-income families who spend a large portion of their income on housing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in former President Trump's new tax legislation could create a significant tax surprise for some high-income individuals. The bill temporarily raises the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 but includes a phaseout for those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000. Tax professionals warn this creates a "SALT torpedo," where the effective federal tax rate on income within that range could jump to as high as 45.5%. This is due to the simultaneous increase in taxable income and the loss of the deduction benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that COVID-19 cases are currently on the rise in 25 states, signaling the potential start of a summer wave. While nationwide activity is still considered "low," wastewater data shows an uptick, with the highest emergency room visit rates seen in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. This increase aligns with a pattern identified by the CDC of biannual surges, typically occurring in the summer and winter, driven by the virus's genetic evolution.

Credit counseling and debt management plans can help by negotiating lower interest rates with creditors, making payments more manageable. For those already behind on payments, debt forgiveness or settlement can reduce the total amount owed, though it may impact credit scores. Additionally, many lenders offer temporary hardship programs, and for overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can provide a legal path to financial stability.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, most notably the 7/7 London bombings in 2005. His leadership also faced intense scrutiny following the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by police two weeks after the bombings, an incident for which the force was later found to have breached health and safety laws. Lord Blair, who joined the police in 1974, resigned in 2008 after losing the confidence of then-London Mayor Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a bill repealing a voter-approved law that guaranteed paid sick leave and inflation-based adjustments to the minimum wage. The original measure, passed by voters just eight months ago, is being rolled back after lobbying from the state's largest business group, which argued it was a burdensome mandate. The repeal is a significant setback for workers' rights advocates, who called the governor's action a "betrayal" to families needing to care for sick children without losing pay. Proponents of the paid leave law are now considering a new ballot initiative to reinstate the benefits.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) continue to be an attractive option for savers. The primary benefit is their high interest rates, which are still competitive despite a slight dip from their recent peaks. However, a potential drawback is that these rates are variable and may fall preemptively if banks anticipate future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. While HYSAs offer crucial flexibility for accessing funds, savers should be aware that the best rates are typically found at online-only banks, which may be a change for those accustomed to traditional branch banking.</p>

          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will significantly change the federal student loan system, reducing the number of repayment plans and setting new borrowing caps. The law phases out existing plans like SAVE and introduces two new options: a standard 10-to-25-year plan and a new income-driven plan with a repayment term of up to 30 years. It also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants and eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new students starting in 2026.

          <p>Emil Bove, a Justice Department official and former Trump defense attorney nominated for a federal judgeship, declined to answer key questions in a Senate questionnaire. Bove avoided stating whether the Constitution permits a third presidential term and refused to denounce the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, calling its characterization a matter of "significant political debate." His responses have drawn criticism from Democrats, who have already accused him of politicizing his role at the DOJ. The questionnaire also addressed his controversial involvement in the decision to drop a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of capital into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, these ETFs recorded their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional interest. The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and macroeconomic factors, including expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve. This price action suggests investors are increasingly confident in the cryptocurrency as both corporate adoption and the potential for clearer crypto legislation grow. (not investment advice)</p>

Under UEFA regulations, two clubs with the same influential owner cannot compete in the same tournament.

The piece calls for a return to focus on real-world concerns and less time spent on social media-fueled conspiracy theories.

The policy marks a historic shift in U.S. trade, pushing effective tariff rates to levels not seen since the 1940s. This uncertainty makes it difficult for firms to make long-term investment decisions and is unlikely to achieve the stated goal of a U.S. manufacturing renaissance. (not investment advice)</p>
