          <p>Tariffs are causing price increases on a range of consumer goods, with some distributors reporting price hikes of 8-15% on millions of items. This "re-ticketing" reflects a direct inflationary impact not seen since the pandemic, though at a lower scale. Concurrently, businesses are reducing their inventory levels and SKU counts due to trade uncertainty and concerns about consumer demand, leading to predictions of a milder holiday shopping season. Supply chain data indicates a slowdown in imports and a buildup of empty shipping containers, suggesting a cautious approach from retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network defamed him by falsely claiming he lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, centers on comments made by anchor Jesse Watters, who accused Newsom of dishonesty regarding the timing of a conversation with the president. Newsom's legal team asserts that Fox News willfully distorted facts to support the president and has offered to drop the suit in exchange for a retraction and on-air apology. The damages sought are notably similar to the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit.</p>

Critics, including the Free Speech Coalition, argued the law unconstitutionally burdens adult access to protected material and creates privacy risks.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent leak of a "low confidence" report minimizing damage to an Iranian nuclear facility, which was later contradicted by official assessments, highlights a major problem in journalism. The author contends that media outlets like CNN grant instant credulity to any leak that is damaging to President Trump, leading to misinformation. The proposed solution is for the administration to aggressively find and prosecute the government officials who leak classified or sensitive information. The author believes that re-establishing the risk of jail time for leakers would curb politically motivated leaks and force journalists to be more critical of their sources.</p>

Other humanitarian agencies, including Doctors Without Borders and UNRWA, have labeled the GHF a "death trap" and refused to collaborate, citing a pattern of violence and dehumanizing aid practices.

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has significantly limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies. The ruling stemmed from challenges to a Trump executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, which had been halted by multiple lower courts. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such broad orders often exceed the authority granted to courts, though she left open the possibility for them when necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs. The decision reins in a tool used to stymie policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations, but did not rule on the constitutionality of the citizenship order itself.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court sided with a group of Maryland parents, affirming their right to opt their elementary school children out of instruction that uses storybooks with LGBTQ+ themes. Justice Samuel Alito, in the majority opinion, stated that forcing children into instruction that violates their families' sincere religious beliefs places an unconstitutional burden on religious freedom. The court ordered the school district to provide advance notice and allow children to be excused from these lessons while the lawsuit proceeds. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned the decision could lead to "chaos" for public schools by creating burdensome administrative challenges.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has publicly stated that his team is in discussions with reigning world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but break clauses are rumored to exist in his deal. The talks are significant given Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' potential with the upcoming 2026 engine regulation changes. Team principal Toto Wolff acknowledged the transparency within the team regarding discussions but affirmed his confidence in Russell, whose own contract negotiations appear to be ongoing amid the high-profile talks with Verstappen.</p>

Monzo attacked and killed the schoolboy with a samurai sword and injured five other people, including police officers, during a 20-minute rampage on April 30, 2024. During the trial, it was revealed that Monzo had been screaming "in delight" after the attack and had a history of paranoia induced by cannabis use. The judge noted that Monzo's self-induced intoxication was the dominant cause of his actions, rejecting his claim of diminished responsibility.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that his government's welfare reforms have achieved "the right balance" after making significant concessions to prevent a rebellion from his own Labour Party MPs. The initial plan would have tightened eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for all claimants, but will now only apply to new applicants. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients following pressure from about 120 MPs. Despite the changes, some MPs on the left of the party still plan to vote against the bill, arguing the reforms do not go far enough.</p>

Tanenhaus positions Buckley as a pivotal figure who inherited and then catalyzed the modern conservative movement, paving the way for political figures from Barry Goldwater to Donald Trump. The excerpt provides a glimpse into the family's life at their Connecticut estate, "Great Elm," and the origins of Buckley's drive.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New Orleans has awarded nearly $2.4 million in damages to a 68-year-old man who was sexually abused by a member of the Holy Cross religious order in the late 1960s. The survivor, John Lousteau, reported being abused at a summer camp run by the order, leading to a lifetime of addiction and mental health struggles. This is the first major verdict of its kind since a 2024 Louisiana law allowed survivors to sue for damages regardless of when the abuse occurred. The case sets a significant precedent for other abuse claims, particularly as the New Orleans archdiocese navigates bankruptcy related to its own clergy abuse scandal.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has announced it will hear further arguments in the case concerning Louisiana's new congressional map, which includes a second majority-Black district. The decision to postpone a final ruling means the map, approved by the GOP-led legislature to comply with the Voting Rights Act, will remain in place for now. The case pits a group of "non-African-American" voters, who claim the map is an illegal racial gerrymander, against state officials and voting rights advocates. This legal battle highlights the complex challenge lawmakers face in balancing racial representation required by federal law without unconstitutionally making race the predominant factor in drawing district lines.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has rejected a challenge to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a key component of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ruling preserves the mandate requiring insurers to cover a wide range of preventive health services, such as cancer screenings and certain medications, at no cost to patients. The challenge was brought by a group of Christian-owned businesses arguing the task force was unconstitutionally structured and wielded unchecked power. Public health advocates had warned that dismantling the task force's recommendations would have devastating consequences for the health of roughly 150 million Americans who benefit from the provision.</p>

This political pressure comes as the Fed navigates key decisions on interest rates and banking regulations.

Based on current data, a 65-year-old man could expect around $1,942 per month, while a woman might receive about $1,861, with the difference due to longer female life expectancy. A joint-life annuity for a couple would pay less, around $1,684, as it covers two lives.

          <p>This analysis argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is not the straightforward win for Donald Trump that it may appear to be. While the ruling restricts the ability of a single judge to block a policy nationwide, it leaves the door open for such injunctions when necessary to provide "complete relief," potentially including the birthright citizenship case itself. The article points out that the practice of "judge-shopping" for nationwide injunctions has been used against both parties, and reining it in could benefit future Democratic administrations as well. Ultimately, the decision resolves little, suggesting these broad court orders are still permissible in some circumstances.</p>

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's effusive praise and bizarre reference to Trump as "daddy" drew particular derision, though Trump's team celebrated it. Analysts are divided on the strategy, with some viewing it as a pragmatic way to achieve policy goals, like increased defense spending, by managing Trump's ego. Others argue that such sycophancy signals weakness, undermines the principle of an alliance of equals, and ultimately earns Trump's disdain rather than his respect.</p>
