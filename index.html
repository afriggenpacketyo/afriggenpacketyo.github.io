          <p>Tufts University doctoral candidate Rumeysa Ozturk, detained by ICE in March, returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk, speaking at a news conference with Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, expressed gratitude and faith in American justice. The federal judge said that the Trump administration had not provided any evidence for her detainment besides an op-ed she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper last year, the op-ed centered Israel's war with Hamas. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE officers in March, and Judge Sessions said that there was no evidence that she engaged or encouraged violence.</p>

Dyer, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, reflected on how fame led to "bad decisions" and drug use, but the letter prompted him to commit to treatment and reflect on the pain he'd caused his family. He credits his role in EastEnders in 2013 as a turning point when he "had no money" and was in a "weird spiral" of club appearances, drugs, and alcohol. This made him realize how addiction "affects so many people around you, not just yourself.</p>

Negotiations were expected to continue on Sunday after the first face-to-face meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and China‚Äôs Vice-Premier He Lifeng.

          <p>Four people, including three teenagers, were shot on a SEPTA bus in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park neighborhood. The victims, two 16-year-old boys, a 14-year-old boy, and a 39-year-old woman, are all in stable condition. Police believe a man confronted a group of juveniles, pulled a gun, and shot the four people; the motive is unclear. The shooter fled, but the incident was captured on bus cameras, which detectives are reviewing. Violence in any form is unacceptable, and the police department is doing everything they can to ensure the public safety of those that are walking our streets and riding our public transportation.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise as a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option when treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking the activity of the protein‚Äôs tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signalling cell growth. Wang Xin, professor at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Hospital, said zongertinib had the ‚Äúpotential to establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC‚Äù.

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are finding renewed success in China by expanding into lower-tier cities, as coffee chains grapple with sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks' China operations saw flat same-store sales, but a 4 per cent increase in transactions helped to offset a 4 per cent decline in the average tab, and the company has added 665 stores in China over the past year. A total of 66,920 coffee shops opened across China over the past year, with much of that growth was concentrated in second and ‚Äúnew first-tier cities‚Äù. Chengdu, capital of southwestern Sichuan province, added 1,995 coffee shops over the past year, ranking third nationwide, while tech hub Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province, ranked sixth with 1,725 new openings.</p>

          <p>Despite government approval and a slow trend towards a cashless society, app-based digital salary payments are yet to gain traction in Japan two years after being introduced. While over 100 companies offer PayPay as a salary payment method, only 2.8 percent of surveyed individuals use it, citing a lack of perceived benefits. Companies also cite a lack of demand, increased costs, and administrative work as reasons for not adopting the option. The percentage of cashless payments in 2024 topped 40 percent of all settlements in value, achieving the government's target a year ahead of schedule.</p>

While atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., this event is due to a "cutoff low," diverting the jet stream back East.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested restarting direct negotiations with Ukraine, aiming for a durable peace by addressing the conflict's root causes, proposing Istanbul as the venue for talks on May 15. Putin's preconditions typically include NATO non-expansion, Ukraine's neutrality, and leadership change, which are long-standing grievances used to justify the 2022 invasion. This proposal comes amidst pressure from European leaders who are urging an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and threatens to increase sanctions if Russia does not comply. The offer from Putin does not directly address the request for a 30-day ceasefire, however Putin is expected to speak with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>

Border crossings between the US and Canada are down some 17% since Trump started bringing in tariffs, according to CBP data. Canadians car trips to the US are down almost 32% compared to March 2024, according to Statistics Canada. Many Canadians are choosing to "Buy Canadian" and reducing travel to the US in response to the fraying relationship between the two neighboring countries.
