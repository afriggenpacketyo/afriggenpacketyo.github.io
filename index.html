          <p>Nvidia is set to resume sales of its H20 chips to China after a U.S. export ban was eased, but analysts predict its market dominance will decline significantly. Chinese competitors like Huawei have gained substantial ground, with forecasts suggesting Nvidia's AI chip market share in China could fall from 66% to 54% by 2025. The situation is further complicated by Beijing's national security scrutiny of the chips and its broader push for homegrown AI infrastructure. This dynamic highlights the ongoing tech tensions and intense competition between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The appearance of senior Chinese official Cai Qi at a seaside meeting with technology and social science experts is a strong indicator that the country's political elite has begun its annual summer retreat. This unofficial gathering takes place in Beidaihe, a coastal town east of Beijing, where top leaders discuss major state matters away from public view. During this period, which typically lasts around two weeks, leaders reduce their public appearances. The city has already implemented heightened security measures, including a ban on drones for July and August, confirming the presence of high-level officials.</p>

          <p>Chicago police are alerting residents about a series of violent armed robberies in the River North neighborhood, primarily targeting individuals who appear intoxicated as they leave bars. According to reports, attackers have been befriending victims before beating them and stealing their property, with a particular focus on accessing financial apps on their phones. One victim recounted being held at gunpoint by four assailants in ski masks who demanded her phone's passcode. Authorities have identified a suspect vehicle but have not yet made any arrests in connection with the incidents.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages have sharply criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported strategy to secure their release through a "decisive military victory" rather than negotiation. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum described this approach as an illusion that leads both Israel and the hostages toward devastation. This condemnation follows the release of harrowing videos by Hamas and Islamic Jihad showing hostages in visibly poor health. In response to the footage, Hamas has offered the Red Cross access to the hostages, conditioned on the opening of humanitarian corridors throughout Gaza.</p>

          <h2>UK Car Finance Industry Calls Proposed Mis-Selling Redress Scheme 'Impractical'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's car finance trade body has labeled the financial regulator's proposed compensation scheme for mis-selling as "completely impractical." The Finance and Leasing Association raised concerns about the plan to cover loans dating back to 2007, arguing that neither firms nor customers are likely to have the necessary paperwork from that era. This criticism follows a Supreme Court ruling that left the door open for compensation claims over large, hidden commissions. The Financial Conduct Authority estimates the redress could cost the industry up to £18 billion, a cost the trade body warns may lead to more expensive consumer borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

The union members voted down a four-year contract proposal that included a significant wage increase, citing unresolved issues with work schedules and other benefits. This strike adds another challenge for the aerospace giant, which has faced numerous safety and production crises in recent years.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece in The Guardian argues that the Democratic party and liberal media insiders made a critical error by not encouraging President Joe Biden to step aside before the election. The author contends it was obvious to most Americans that Biden was too old for another term, but the political establishment suppressed dissent out of fear of losing access and underestimating the risk of a Donald Trump victory. The article suggests this failure to listen to public sentiment and confront reality ultimately led to a disastrous outcome. It calls for the party to learn from its mistakes and empower a new generation of leaders.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season tour has revealed early signs of a significant transformation under new manager Ruben Amorim, marked by both tactical adjustments and a more relaxed team culture. The article details a shift towards a flexible three-man defense and a coaching style that emphasizes player autonomy and accountability over rigid rules. While the atmosphere appears more positive, with players reportedly responding well to new training methods, the analysis cautions that these green shoots mean little without results. The true test of whether this represents real progress or another false dawn will come when the Premier League season begins.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic legislators have fled Texas in a dramatic move to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a new congressional map. The Democrats argue the proposed districts are a partisan gerrymander designed to unfairly increase the GOP's U.S. House majority at the expense of minority voters. By leaving the state, they have effectively halted the special legislative session called by Governor Greg Abbott, who has threatened to have the lawmakers removed from office.

This move, combined with recent player signings like Omar Marmoush and Rayan Cherki who excel at carrying the ball, points toward a new philosophy.

          <p>A commentary in The Guardian argues that the current political landscape is defined by a dangerous stagnation where failing mainstream parties maintain power despite widespread public disaffection. The author suggests that while new movements and parties emerge on the left and right, the established system is resilient enough to prevent significant change, creating a permanent state of disconnect. This results in a volatile cycle of angry protests and impotent government, where the center holds power not through belief but through inertia. The real risk is not a political collapse, but a miserable status quo where nothing fundamentally improves.</p>

The article notes that while some women who choose to be child-free face criticism, the larger issue is the state's failure to fully support families. Sociologists warn that without improved family-friendly policies, Germany faces long-term risks to its social insurance and economic stability.</p>

          <h2>German Police Expand Use of Controversial Palantir Surveillance Software Amid Protests</h2>

          <p>Several German states are expanding their use of Gotham, a powerful AI-driven surveillance software from U.S. firm Palantir, despite significant opposition from privacy advocates. Civil rights groups have filed constitutional complaints, arguing the software's ability to perform mass data analysis on citizens violates fundamental rights by ensnaring innocent people in a digital dragnet. Critics also raise concerns about Germany's growing dependence on the controversial U.S. tech company. The federal government has not ruled out purchasing the software for national police forces, breaking with the previous administration's stance.</p>

          <p>A new report from the UK-China Transparency think tank suggests that some Chinese students at UK universities are being pressured by Chinese officials to spy on their peers. The goal is allegedly to suppress campus discussions on topics sensitive to the Chinese government, such as human rights in Xinjiang or the origins of Covid-19. The survey of academics also revealed instances of intimidation and harassment directed at lecturers and their families in China. This comes as a new UK law places greater responsibility on universities to protect academic freedom and free speech from foreign influence.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for China's maturing biotech industry. This turning point signals that leading firms are becoming self-sustaining and no longer reliant on investor funding. Innovent's financial outlook is significantly boosted by the anticipated success of mazdutide, a new GLP-1 weight-loss drug launched in July. The success of these companies demonstrates the growing value and innovation within China's domestic pharmaceutical sector. (not investment advice)</p>
