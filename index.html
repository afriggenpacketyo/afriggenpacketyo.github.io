          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance as investors evaluated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, influenced by tariff uncertainties after a U.S. court ruling deemed most of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. India's Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indices saw gains following Trump's claim that India offered to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports. Meanwhile, Japan's Nikkei 225 traded flat, South Korea's Kospi rose, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced declines. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission fined Societe Generale's local unit for failing to prevent suspicious orders in electricity and wheat futures markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland is expected to remain the drug death capital of Europe for the seventh consecutive year, despite a potential slight decrease in 2024 deaths compared to the 1,172 deaths in 2023. Experts warn that the arrival of deadly synthetic opioids, known as nitazenes, is exacerbating the crisis, with suspected deaths already higher this year than last year. The crisis is rooted in social and economic changes, including the decline of manufacturing industries and subsequent joblessness, leading to alienation and addiction. Efforts to tackle the issue include harm reduction strategies, but challenges remain in addressing the underlying causes and providing adequate rehabilitation services.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing, with a cash value of approximately $589 million, after no tickets matched Monday's winning numbers. This jackpot ranks as the fifth-largest in Powerball history and the ninth-largest among all U.S. lottery jackpots. A single winner would have the option of a lump-sum payment or an annuity paid over 29 years. The next drawing will be the 41st since the last jackpot win in California on May 31, 2025, highlighting the rarity of winning such a large prize.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces increasing pressure to demonstrate tangible results and differentiate his government from the Reform UK party. Acknowledging public frustration over the pace of change, Starmer is reorganizing his Downing Street team and emphasizing the government's actions as superior to Reform UK's proposals. Reform UK has gained visibility, particularly on the issue of asylum, prompting Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to defend their approach as thoughtful and workable. The government's recent decision to suspend family reunion applications from refugees highlights the ongoing political tussle between Labour and Reform UK.</p>

          <p>European stocks are expected to open near the flatline on Tuesday, influenced by tariff uncertainty affecting global markets. Regional bourses experienced gains on Monday, driven by corporate news in the defense and healthcare sectors. However, overnight sentiment shifted due to mixed trading in Asia-Pacific markets and unease in U.S. stock futures, compounded by a U.S. court ruling against President Trump's global tariffs. Investors are closely monitoring Euro zone inflation data and Spanish unemployment figures, as these economic indicators could further impact market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>SNAP Benefit Cuts Begin, Prompting Changes in Grocery Shopping Patterns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 22:30:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are going into effect, potentially impacting low-income Americans' grocery purchasing power. Experts predict that discount grocers like Walmart may benefit as consumers seek ways to save money on groceries. Independent grocery stores are expected to feel the most significant impact, with potential ripple effects on jobs in the sector. The changes are also expected to influence nutritional choices, with SNAP customers potentially trading down to less costly but less healthy options.</p>

          <p>The government is changing the law to grant the Justice Secretary veto power over new sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in England and Wales. The Justice Secretary and the Lady Chief Justice must both approve future guidelines before they can be issued. This change follows a dispute over pre-sentence reports for offenders from certain minority groups. The government asserts the reforms will not interfere with judicial independence in individual sentencing decisions.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized trade ties with India as a "totally one sided disaster" following Prime Minister Modi's visit to China. Trump claimed India offered to cut tariffs to zero but it was "getting late." He reiterated concerns about India buying oil and arms from Russia while imposing high tariffs on U.S. exports. Data indicates that India's average tariff on U.S. imports was higher than the U.S.'s tariff on Indian goods. The U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on the country, including secondary duties of 25% last month for purchasing Russian oil.</p>
