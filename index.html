          <p>Shares for the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged 12% following a strong fiscal fourth-quarter report that surpassed Wall Street's predictions. The company's CEO, Max Levchin, attributed the success to robust consumer spending and significant growth in merchant partnerships, including with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon. Affirm also provided optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year, signaling confidence in its business model despite increasing competition in the e-commerce lending sector. The positive results have been driven by increased transaction frequency and the growing adoption of its Affirm Card. (not investment advice)</p>

DeVito gained fan-favorite status last season but was cut from a crowded Giants quarterback room. His agent confirmed that he is heading to New England well-stocked with his mother's signature frozen cutlets and homemade sauces. DeVito is expected to serve as a backup to Drake Maye and Joshua Dobbs, joining the Patriots as they build their team under new head coach Mike Vrabel.</p>

          <p>Police in Schertz, Texas, have arrested two male students from Clemens High School for making terroristic threats. According to the investigation, one student expressed a desire to "shoot up the school," while the second student allegedly offered to supply the weapons for the attack. The plot was thwarted after a third student reported the threats to school administrators, who then worked with law enforcement. Both suspects were charged with a third-degree felony and transported to a juvenile detention center.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court injunction that had banned the housing of asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial ban was sought by the local council following a series of violent anti-migrant protests at the site. However, the appellate judges ruled that closing the hotel would hinder the government's legal duty to house asylum seekers and could incentivize other councils to take similar action. Police are now preparing for potential further unrest as the decision allows 138 asylum seekers to remain at the location.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially revoked the Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris. Typically, this security detail is provided for six months after a vice president leaves office, but Harris had received an extension which has now been rescinded. The decision comes as Harris prepares for a nationwide tour to promote her new book, which recounts her short-lived presidential campaign. A spokesperson for Harris confirmed the change and expressed gratitude to the Secret Service for their past service and dedication.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was eliminated from the US Open after a decisive 6-1, 6-2 loss to 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the third round. Despite entering the match with confidence after two strong wins, Raducanu was overwhelmed by Rybakina's powerful serves and dominant groundstrokes from the start. The Kazakhstani player consistently controlled the baseline, forcing Raducanu into defensive positions and preventing her from establishing any rhythm. This defeat marks another instance where Raducanu has struggled against a top-tier opponent, highlighting the challenges she faces in consistently competing at the highest level.</p>

The move has drawn international criticism and sparked domestic protests from families of the remaining hostages, who fear for their safety.

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her seventh album, "Man's Best Friend," and addressed the viral debate surrounding its original cover art. In an interview, Carpenter explained that the controversial cover, which depicted her kneeling with her hair being pulled, was intended to be open to interpretation about control and the lack of it. She also discussed her songwriting process, noting that she often writes about her relationships and personal experiences with a mix of bitterness and sweetness. Carpenter worked with collaborators like Jack Antonoff on the new album, which follows her Grammy-winning record "Short n' Sweet."</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed confidantes that she will not run for a third term in 2026. According to sources familiar with the matter, Ernst is expected to make a formal announcement next week.

          <p>A record $30 billion is expected to be legally wagered by Americans on the upcoming NFL season, representing an 8.5% increase from the previous year, according to the American Gaming Association. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for their busiest period, but they face a significant threat from unlicensed offshore betting sites. In response, law enforcement is increasing its efforts to crack down on these illegal operations. A recent letter from 50 attorneys general urged the Department of Justice to enhance enforcement, citing an estimated $4 billion in lost state tax revenue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's push for a "pro-American" version of history in schools and national museums is part of a larger culture war over the nation's past. This article argues that the conflict exposes a critical weakness in the U.S. education system: the devaluation of liberal arts in favor of STEM fields. This shift, it contends, has left citizens without essential skills for democratic life, such as critical thinking, historical literacy, and empathy. The author suggests that restoring a focus on the humanities is crucial to combating propaganda and preparing citizens for self-government.</p>

          <p>The UK government secured a technical legal victory as the Court of Appeal permitted asylum seekers to remain at a hotel in Epping, but the decision creates a significant political challenge. The ruling forces the Labour government to defend the use of hotels for housing migrants, a policy it has pledged to end. This has opened the door for criticism from political opponents like Reform UK and the Conservatives, who accuse the government of prioritizing migrants over local communities. The outcome places ministers in a difficult position, caught between their legal duties and political pressures to adopt a tougher stance on immigration.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is anticipating a record-setting Labor Day travel period, with an estimated 17.5 million people expected to pass through airport checkpoints. This travel surge began amid disruptions, including a communications outage at a key air traffic control facility that caused hundreds of delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Despite such issues, millions of Americans are proceeding with their travel plans to mark the end of summer. Most travelers are expected to drive, benefiting from slightly lower gas prices compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. tariff exemption for imported packages valued under $800, known as the de minimis rule, has been ended by the Trump administration. This change will primarily affect direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands like Shein and Temu, as well as small overseas businesses that ship directly to U.S. customers. Experts predict the move could lead to billions in extra costs and shipping delays as tariffs are now applied to millions of small shipments. The policy shift is expected to result in higher prices for consumers, particularly impacting lower-income households who disproportionately purchase from these retailers.</p>

          <p>The Spanish government has canceled a €10 million contract that would have used equipment from Chinese tech giant Huawei to upgrade its national fiber-optic network. The Ministry of Digital Transformation intervened at the last minute, citing the need to protect Spain's "strategic autonomy." This decision reverses a plan to install next-generation Huawei technology across a public network spanning over 16,000 kilometers. The move aligns Spain more closely with EU and U.S. positions, which have urged member states to remove Huawei from their networks due to security concerns.</p>

          <p>The government of Guinea-Bissau has blocked several major Portuguese public broadcasters and a news agency just three months before scheduled parliamentary and presidential elections. Journalists have reported being denied access to cover government matters, creating what the local journalists' union describes as an atmosphere of growing fear. International press freedom organizations, including Reporters Without Borders, have condemned the move as a severe blow to press freedom and an attempt to control media coverage. Opposition figures have voiced alarm, suggesting the crackdown could be a prelude to election manipulation.</p>
