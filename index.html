          <p>Amidst the deadly Central Texas floods, a story of heroism has emerged, focusing on Matthew Crowder, who rescued a sleeping family from their home as floodwaters surged. Acting against the advice of emergency dispatchers, Crowder evacuated the family moments before their house was destroyed, telling officials, "Send help or not, I have work to do." This individual act of bravery highlights the community's response to the disaster, which claimed over 100 lives and left many homeless. The article underscores the devastating personal losses while also showcasing the powerful spirit of neighbors helping neighbors during the crisis.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in at least 120 deaths, with search and rescue teams still looking for over 170 missing individuals. The disaster, centered in Kerr County, was particularly tragic at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp where dozens of campers and staff perished after the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed. A federal disaster has been declared, but rescue efforts are hampered by ongoing storms and challenging terrain. The article also highlights scrutiny over the adequacy of weather forecasts and the lack of local warning systems, which may have contributed to the scale of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration held a summit with leaders from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal, framing the event as a significant commercial opportunity. The meetings focused on President Trump's "trade, not aid" approach to the continent, with discussions centered on U.S. investment, access to natural resources like rare earth minerals, and potential tariff negotiations. The African leaders praised Trump, with some encouraging U.S. investment to counter growing influence from China and Russia. The article suggests this reflects a strategic shift in U.S. policy toward Africa, prioritizing economic and security interests, such as maritime security and migration control.</p>

          <p>Shares of cereal manufacturer WK Kellogg experienced a dramatic surge following reports that Italian confectioner Ferrero is nearing a deal to acquire the company for approximately $3 billion. The potential acquisition would bring iconic brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes under the ownership of the company famous for Nutella and Ferrero Rocher. This move is part of a larger trend of consolidation in the packaged foods industry, as traditional cereal companies face declining sales due to consumer shifts toward healthier breakfast options and private-label brands. The deal could be finalized as soon as this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, a significant increase from the previous 10% rate. President Trump cited an "unfair trade relationship" and what he claimed were "unsustainable Trade Deficits" as primary reasons, although official data shows a U.S. goods trade surplus with Brazil. The move is also described as retaliation for the ongoing prosecution of Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Additionally, the U.S. is launching an investigation into Brazil's alleged unfair trade practices related to the digital activities of American companies.</p>

          <h2>Meeting for New Kerr County Flood Warning System Was Scheduled Just After Deadly Disaster Struck</h2>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, had contracted a firm to develop a new flood warning system, with the initial kickoff meeting scheduled for mid-July, ironically just after the area was devastated by catastrophic floods. The proposed system was intended as a decision-support tool for emergency managers, providing real-time data, but it would not have issued public alerts directly. This revelation comes as records show that local leaders have been discussing the need for improved flood warning systems for decades. The timing underscores the tragic delay in implementing technology that could have potentially aided the response to the disaster.</p>

          <p>Veteran actor Embeth Davidtz is making her directorial debut with "Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight," a film based on Alexandra Fuller's memoir about growing up in colonial Rhodesia. Davidtz, who herself grew up in South Africa during apartheid, uses the film to grapple with the institutionalized racism she witnessed. The movie is told from the perspective of an 8-year-old white child, exposing the normalized bigotry of the era. In the article, Davidtz discusses how her personal experiences with her family and the political system shaped her desire to tell this difficult story, using her new role as a director to confront her past.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose new tariffs on 20 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, with the duties set to take effect on August 1. The tariff rates vary by country, with some nations like Myanmar facing levies as high as 40%, while Japan and South Korea face 25% rates. The White House has stated that these countries can avoid the tariffs by negotiating new trade deals with the U.S. before the deadline. This broad protectionist move is expected to significantly raise the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports, sparking concerns about potential inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as President Joe Biden's White House physician, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and asserted doctor-patient privilege in refusing to answer questions before the House Oversight Committee. The Republican-led committee had subpoenaed Dr. O'Connor as part of its investigation into Biden's mental fitness during his time in office. GOP Chairman James Comer called the move unprecedented and suggested it fuels speculation of a cover-up. The refusal to testify is a significant development in the ongoing partisan investigation into the former president's health and cognitive state.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has recommended relaxing the cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move that could provide greater access to homeownership for first-time buyers in the UK. The proposal would allow individual banks to issue a higher percentage of their new mortgages to borrowers with large loan-to-income ratios. Major lenders have welcomed the potential change, stating it could help people struggling with high rents and strict affordability tests. While this could stimulate the housing market, the Bank also noted that millions of existing mortgage holders face significant increases in their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Physicians are expressing concern that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals and clinics is deterring undocumented immigrants from seeking necessary medical care. While agents are often present to provide medical clearance for detainees, their appearance is reportedly creating an atmosphere of fear throughout the wider community. Doctors report that patients are delaying critical care for conditions like heart attacks and strokes, which can have severe consequences.

          <p>Linda Yaccarino is stepping down as the CEO of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, after a tumultuous two-year period. Her departure comes as the platform, now owned by Elon Musk's xAI venture, faces scrutiny over controversial content generated by its AI chatbot, Grok. Yaccarino was brought in from NBCUniversal to repair relationships with advertisers, but many observers felt her authority was limited, with Musk remaining the ultimate decision-maker. Analysts suggest her resignation is not surprising, given Musk's continued controversial use of the platform and the immense challenges of running the business.</p>

The defendants, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, admitted to their roles in providing the firearm to Ryan Routh, who was a convicted felon and thus prohibited from owning a gun. Court documents allege Cooper acted as a middleman for the $350 cash sale, which took place just six weeks before Routh was arrested outside Trump's Florida golf club.

The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, imposes mandatory prison sentences and was challenged by the ACLU and other advocacy groups.

The bans were justified with accusations of "incitement of the people," a move observers see as an attempt to silence dissent and reporting on opposition politicians. With over 95% of Turkish media already considered pro-government, these actions against the few remaining independent outlets are seen as a severe escalation.
