        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that authorities have avoided addressing the ethnicity of perpetrators in grooming gangs, hindering accurate assessments. The report indicates that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of offenders, but local data from three police forces show a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects. The audit criticizes the authorities' failure to understand the nature and scale of the problem, attributing it to ignorance and fear of being seen as racist. The government has pledged to implement the report's recommendations, including mandatory ethnicity data collection and a national inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>

When asked about the possibility of working with Cruise again, Pitt playfully states he would consider it if he doesn't have to perform dangerous stunts like hanging from biplanes. Pitt also discussed his upcoming film, "F1: The Movie," where he enjoyed driving at high speeds, and reflected on the importance of surrounding himself with loved ones as he gets older.</p>

Personal lines of credit may also be suitable for larger expenses due to potentially lower interest rates.

The illicit rentals increase liability and maintenance costs for real estate companies while depriving them of sales income.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering expanding its travel ban to include up to 36 additional countries, according to a State Department memo. The memo demands that diplomats from these nations, primarily in Africa, Central Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands, detail how they will address U.S. concerns regarding vetting and screening information. Concerns include terrorism risks, unreliable criminal records, widespread government fraud, high visa overstay rates, and anti-American activity. Countries failing to address these issues could face travel bans as early as August.</p>
