          <p>Three U.S. officials revealed to CBS News that President Trump opposed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The officials stated that the proposed assassination was discussed between Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu following Israel's recent attack on Iran. Trump's rejection of the plan was initially reported by Reuters, and Netanyahu declined to confirm or deny the report during a Fox News interview.  Trump subsequently issued warnings to Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets.</p>
