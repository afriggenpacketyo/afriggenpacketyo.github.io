          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel's military actions against Iran are aimed at dismantling its nuclear program, not pursuing regime change. Speaking to CNBC, Herzog accused Iran of deceptive practices and rapidly advancing towards nuclear weapon capabilities. He noted that while regime change could potentially bring peace, the immediate objective is to eliminate the nuclear threat. Herzog also mentioned ongoing back-channel talks and diplomatic dialogues with world leaders to de-escalate the situation, following recent airstrikes by Israel targeting Iran's nuclear facilities. The international community remains divided on the issue, with some supporting Israel's actions and others condemning them.</p>

One Los Angeles resident, Franchescoli Andrade, faces a 90-minute commute each way using public transportation after his car became too expensive to repair. A study indicates that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living costs, including transportation, with the average cost of owning a new car exceeding $12,000 per year. While moving to more affordable areas is an option for some, it's not a practical solution for many families due to community ties and other considerations.</p>

          <p>3D-printed guns, untraceable firearms assembled using 3D printers and downloadable blueprints, are increasingly spreading online, raising concerns about their potential use by criminals and violent extremists. These guns evade gun-control laws, with advanced models capable of firing multiple rounds. BBC Trending's investigation found advertisements for guns, including 3D-printed ones, on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram, often directing customers to channels offering illegal weapons. Experts warn that the materials have improved, costs have decreased, and access to blueprints is easier, making 3D-printed guns a potential "weapon of choice" for those planning violence.</p>

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that the drugs were not cost-effective, considering their limited benefits and the significant resources required for treatment. While the drugs can delay the transition from mild to moderate dementia, the high cost and potential side effects led to the decision not to fund them, a move supported by some dementia experts despite disappointment from campaigners.</p>
