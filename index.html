        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine reports its largest long-range attack, targeting 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases using smuggled drones in what they call "Operation Spider's Web". President Zelenskyy lauded the operation, claiming the destruction of 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers, causing an estimated $7 billion in damages. The drones were reportedly hidden in mobile wooden cabins on trucks near the airbases. This attack coincides with reports of a massive Russian drone and missile attack on Ukrainian territory and the resumption of peace talks in Istanbul. The claims have not been independently verified, and Russian officials have confirmed attacks on military bases but have not confirmed the extent of the damage. The ongoing conflict continues to escalate with both sides engaging in intense aerial attacks. Optimism is tempered by the continued violence and uncertainty of the peace talks.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who participated in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon she received from Trump, stating that it contributes to a false narrative. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes accepting the pardon would be an admission of innocence, which she denies. She is working with her Republican Senator to formally refuse the pardon. Her actions contrast with other Jan. 6 defendants who have actively sought and utilized their pardons. Hemphill's stance highlights a divide among those involved in the riot regarding the appropriateness of pardons and their impact on perceptions of the federal government.</p>

Piper also recounts instances of discrimination she faced due to her appearance following an attack, but stresses that most people are good and that society and consumerism often contribute to feelings of inadequacy.

          <p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. This directive followed the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by two VA pulmonologists warning about the impact of staff reductions on veterans' healthcare. VA officials claim the policy is standard and aims to ensure proper coordination with public affairs staff. Critics argue this move represents censorship and a "war on science" by the Trump administration, potentially harming veterans by limiting the dissemination of important medical findings.</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of over 50 people and injuries to many more, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses claim the people were fired upon from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while on their way to receive food. The Israeli military denies its forces fired at civilians, citing an initial inquiry. The incident occurred as ceasefire talks falter, with Israel and Hamas trading blame for the lack of progress.</p>
