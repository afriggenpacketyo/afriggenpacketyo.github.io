          <h2>Survey Reveals Top Contenders for Federal Reserve Chair Position</h2>

          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey indicates a tight race for the next Federal Reserve chair, with Scott Bessent and Kevin Warsh tied as the leading candidates, closely followed by Kevin Hassett. The survey of economists and fund managers reflects ongoing tension between President Trump and current Chair Jerome Powell, whom the president has repeatedly criticized. Despite the pressure, 84% of respondents believe Powell will not be fired before his term ends in May 2026. The political jockeying has raised concerns about the Fed's independence, potentially influencing long-term interest rates and the dollar's strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams revealed that the gunman in a deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting was targeting the NFL's offices. The shooter, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, left a note indicating he believed he suffered from CTE, a brain injury associated with contact sports. After taking the wrong elevator, Tamura killed four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life. The investigation shows Tamura, who had a documented mental health history, drove from Las Vegas to New York before the attack.</p>

          <p>PayPal's second-quarter financial results surpassed Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, with sales increasing by 5% year-over-year. However, the company's stock declined as growth in transaction margin dollars, a critical profitability indicator, slowed to 7% from 8% in the previous quarter. Despite this, total payment volume exceeded projections, and the company raised its full-year earnings per share forecast. CEO Alex Chriss's strategy continues to focus on monetizing key assets like Venmo, which saw its payment volume grow at the highest rate in three years. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, which values Norfolk Southern at approximately $320 per share, aims to streamline shipping logistics across the country by combining Union Pacific's western network with Norfolk Southern's eastern routes. The proposed merger will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for such deals due to concerns about reduced competition.

While President Trump frequently invokes religious themes, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and other leaders maintain a more secular public persona, reflecting a broader societal difference. Church attendance is much lower in Canada, and evangelical Christians hold less political influence compared to the U.S. This contrast is partly rooted in history, with the U.S. fostering a competitive religious marketplace while Canada experienced a dramatic decline in the Catholic Church's power, particularly in Quebec, leading to a more secularized society.</p>

The steepest tariffs have been repeatedly delayed, giving companies time to adjust their strategies. Many businesses, anticipating the import taxes, stockpiled goods in advance, creating a buffer that has so far shielded shoppers from immediate cost increases. Additionally, some importers are holding shipments abroad until the tariff situation clarifies, while others are absorbing the initial cost increases to avoid alienating inflation-weary customers, though gradual price increases are still expected.</p>

          <p>Recent diplomatic engagements suggest the European Union's global leverage is diminishing, particularly in its relationships with China and the United States. During tense talks in Beijing, EU officials found their counterparts unwilling to concede on long-standing issues and were met with a newfound confidence from Chinese leaders. European attempts to persuade President Xi Jinping to restrain Russia's actions in Ukraine were reportedly rebuffed, with Xi highlighting the complexity of the conflict. This perceived lack of influence comes after a bruising trade dispute with Washington, raising questions within the bloc about its ability to effectively assert its interests on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Meta is undertaking a costly overhaul of its artificial intelligence strategy following a disappointing reception to its latest Llama 4 AI model. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has initiated a multi-billion dollar spending and hiring spree, bringing in top talent from competitors like OpenAI and Google to form a new Meta Superintelligence Labs. This shift was reportedly prompted by the underperformance of Llama 4, which struggled to compete with rival open-source models. Investors are now closely watching whether this massive investment will pay off and help Meta regain its footing in the fiercely competitive AI landscape.</p>

          <p>The United States is intensifying efforts to establish a domestic supply chain for rare earths, critical elements for everything from electric vehicles to defense technology, to reduce its dependence on China. China currently dominates the market, mining around 70% and processing 90% of these materials, giving it a powerful bargaining chip in the ongoing trade war. Recent U.S. initiatives include a $400 million Department of Defense investment in American producer MP Materials and a $1 billion loan from major banks. These moves aim to counter China's monopoly and its use of export controls as a strategic weapon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to widespread pessimism, this article argues that the institution of marriage in the U.S. is showing signs of a comeback after decades of decline. Data indicates that the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 40% since its peak in the 1980s, and the share of children living in two-parent married families has started to increase. The author suggests marriage is adapting, with husbands taking on more domestic responsibilities. Despite critiques from both the left and right, the article posits that stable marriage is becoming a norm again, conferring benefits of happiness, financial security, and stability to couples and children.</p>

          <p>Fans of heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne will have an opportunity to pay their final respects as his funeral cortege travels through his hometown of Birmingham. The procession is scheduled to move along Broad Street, passing the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, where thousands of tributes have already been left. The event, which precedes a private funeral, allows the public to honor the singer, who died at age 76. The Lord Mayor of Birmingham described Osbourne as a "son of Birmingham" who put the city on the map, and the city council has coordinated the event with Osbourne's family.</p>

          <p>During his visit to Scotland, President Donald Trump met with First Minister John Swinney for a brief but "convivial" discussion at his Aberdeenshire golf resort. Swinney used the opportunity to advocate for an exemption for Scotch whisky from U.S. tariffs, highlighting its unique production and importance to the Scottish economy. The First Minister also raised concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, urging the president to use his influence to secure a ceasefire. Trump later opened a new golf course on his estate, calling Swinney a "terrific guy" and expressing his affection for Scotland.</p>

          <p>The de Havilland Aircraft Museum near London has painstakingly restored the fuselage of a de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial passenger jet. The Comet, which began service in 1952, ushered in the jet age with unprecedented speed and comfort but was plagued by a series of catastrophic structural failures that led to its grounding. The restoration showcases the luxurious but flawed design, including its signature rectangular windows and opulent cabin. The exhibit serves as both a tribute to a pioneering aircraft and a stark reminder of the tragic lessons that helped make modern air travel safer.</p>

Kyle defended the law, stating that anyone wanting to overturn it is siding with predators.

Analysts suggest both sides had political motivations for the conflict but may now find it beneficial to de-escalate.

          <p>Workers and union leaders in the U.S. are reporting labor shortages at factories as a direct result of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. At industrial plants in Michigan and Kentucky, employees describe how the forced departure of veteran immigrant workers has led to production slowdowns and mandated overtime for remaining staff. The administration's policies, including the termination of parole programs for several nationalities, have stripped legal work status from over a million immigrants. Economists warn that these large-scale deportations could have severe consequences for the U.S. economy, impacting industries from construction to hospitality.</p>
