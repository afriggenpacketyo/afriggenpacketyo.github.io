          <p>Yum Brands announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst predictions, primarily due to declining same-store sales at its Pizza Hut and KFC chains in the United States. While Taco Bell showed a 4% growth in same-store sales, it also missed Wall Street's higher expectations. The company cited an "insufficient value message" for the struggles at Pizza Hut and KFC, which saw U.S. same-store sales drop by 5% each. Despite the setbacks in a challenging consumer market, Yum's overall system sales grew by 2%, supported by international performance and a 57% share of digital transactions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023 was a preventable tragedy caused by OceanGate's deliberate evasion of safety regulations. The extensive report reveals the company used "intimidation tactics" to avoid regulatory oversight and operated with a "toxic" safety culture. Key failures identified include a flawed design and testing process that ignored fundamental engineering principles for deep-sea environments. The investigation also found that OceanGate continued to use the vessel despite prior incidents that likely compromised the hull's integrity, ultimately leading to the deaths of all five people aboard.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a Texas law requiring voters to include a state ID or partial Social Security number on their mail-in ballots, reversing a lower court's decision. The ruling stated the law does not violate the Civil Rights Act, as the identification requirement is a material factor in confirming voter eligibility. The court's opinion, authored by Judge James Ho, emphasized that states have a legitimate interest in combating potential voter fraud and possess considerable discretion in implementing measures to ensure election integrity. This decision marks a significant victory for Texas in a legal battle initiated by the Biden administration over the state's 2021 election integrity law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on disclosing the immigration status and ethnicity of crime suspects needs to change to promote greater transparency. The debate was reignited following a case involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where the two suspects are reportedly Afghan. Current national guidelines do not typically include sharing such details once a person is charged, a practice some critics label a "cover-up." Proponents of the change, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, argue that withholding this information erodes public trust, while others caution against jeopardizing the right to a fair trial.</p>

Air quality alerts are active in states including New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin, with cities like Detroit and New York City ranking among the worst globally for air pollution. The National Weather Service maps show widespread areas with air quality rated as "unhealthy for sensitive groups," which includes children, older adults, and individuals with heart or lung conditions.

          <p>Photographs circulating online appear to show a new Chinese sixth-generation stealth aircraft, sparking analysis and speculation among military experts. The images reveal a sleek, tailless design with a lambda-wing layout, suggesting it could be a high-speed drone or a collaborative combat aircraft rather than a piloted fighter. Analysts note its slim fuselage and smaller size compared to other known prototypes, like the J-36, which may indicate an optimization for stealth over maneuverability. This development suggests China may be advancing multiple next-generation combat aircraft programs simultaneously, continuing its rapid military modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. The Democrats' departure broke the legislative quorum, stalling a bill that could create five new Republican-leaning districts. In response, the Republican-controlled House voted to compel their return under warrant of arrest, escalating a tense political standoff. Former President Trump has voiced support for the redistricting, claiming Republicans are "entitled" to more seats, while Democrats accuse the governor of authoritarian tactics for threatening to arrest political opponents exercising a constitutionally recognized procedural tool.</p>

While he recently downplayed the idea, stating he would be a "two-term president," he has previously suggested that "there are methods" to run again and that he might be "entitled" to another four years. These remarks have been interpreted by some as a way to project strength and avoid lame-duck status, while allies have even introduced resolutions to amend the Constitution.

          <h2>Perinatal Psychiatrist Criticizes Misinformation on SSRIs and Pregnancy</h2>

          <p>A perinatal psychiatrist expresses deep concern over misinformation about the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy, following a recent FDA advisory panel discussion. The author of this article argues that the panel overstated risks and platformed falsehoods, which could deter pregnant individuals from seeking necessary treatment for mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Citing robust data, the psychiatrist emphasizes that untreated maternal mental illness poses significant risks to both mother and baby, and that the benefits of SSRIs often outweigh the manageable neonatal risks. The piece calls for evidence-based guidance to ensure patients can make informed decisions about their health.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, global health leaders are being called upon to support Bangladesh's public health system to preserve decades of remarkable progress. The country has seen significant improvements in life expectancy and reductions in mortality rates, achieved through innovative community-based care and international cooperation. As an interim government takes over, there are concerns that this political transition could jeopardize hard-won gains. Experts are urging organizations like the WHO and World Bank to provide strategic assistance, ensuring that essential health services and crucial initiatives, such as improving primary care, continue without interruption during this critical period.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including eleven awards of £100,000, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom, according to National Savings and Investments (NS&I). Critics argue that the government-owned bank is not doing enough to locate the winners, particularly those who were gifted bonds or only possess old paper records. While NS&I states it has paid over 99% of prize winners since 1957, solicitors and consumer groups are calling for reforms to make the tracing process less bureaucratic. They suggest that NS&I should join government-wide notification services to simplify locating account holders or their heirs, especially during a cost of living crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed significantly in June to its lowest level since September 2023, falling 16% to $60.2 billion. The decrease was driven by a sharp drop in consumer goods imports, reflecting the impact of President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs on global commerce. While exports also saw a slight decline, the overall reduction in the trade gap provided a substantial boost to the U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter. This economic data comes as the Trump administration prepares to implement another round of tariff hikes, which are expected to raise the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest point since 1934.

          <p>A year after a student-led uprising led to the ousting of Bangladesh's long-serving prime minister, the families of those killed in the protests are still demanding justice. The 2024 unrest, which left up to 1,400 people dead, was a pivotal moment in the nation's history, leading to the formation of an interim government. However, there is a growing sense of disillusionment as the new administration struggles to address key issues and the tribunal established to prosecute those responsible for the violence moves slowly. For families like that of Abu Sayed, a 24-year-old student shot by police, the wait for accountability prolongs their pain and grief.</p>

          <p>Clean-up efforts are ongoing across Scotland after Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, left thousands of homes without electricity. As of Tuesday morning, 22,000 properties, primarily in the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire, were still without power, down from an initial 72,000. Utility company SSEN has deployed hundreds of engineers to repair damage, which is mostly related to fallen trees, but warns that some localized restorations may extend into Thursday. The storm also caused widespread travel disruption, with numerous train cancellations and road closures due to gusts reaching up to 90mph.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Jeremy Corbyn has criticized his former Labour colleague, Communities Secretary Angela Rayner, for authorizing the sale of land at eight community allotment sites since the general election. Allotments are protected by law, and their sale requires ministerial approval. Corbyn, a well-known allotment enthusiast, argued that these sales make the future of precious green spaces more perilous, especially when many people lack access to gardens. While the government stated that sales are only approved when necessary, the decision has drawn fire for sacrificing vital community assets, some of which are planned for housing development.</p>
