          <p>American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) reported first-quarter earnings that missed expectations, leading to an 8% drop in shares during extended trading. The company attributed the disappointing results to a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise due to miscalculated merchandising strategies and a cool spring. CEO Jay Schottenstein expressed disappointment but highlighted actions being taken to improve performance in upcoming quarters, including reducing sourcing exposure to China. AEO issued downbeat guidance for the second quarter, expecting revenue and comparable sales to decline, but remains focused on the back-to-school season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gap Inc. shares plummeted after the company announced that new tariffs could cost between $100 million and $150 million annually. Despite beating fiscal first-quarter earnings expectations, the potential impact of tariffs overshadowed the positive results. CEO Richard Dickson stated that the company plans to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain and buying more cotton from the U.S. While Gap beat expectations on both earnings per share and revenue, its gross margin forecast came in weaker than expected, though this was unrelated to tariff effects.

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily halted a lower court's decision blocking President Trump's tariffs, reinstating the levies imposed under an emergency powers law. The appeals court granted the administration's request for a stay while it considers the appeal, warning of irreparable national security and economic harms without interim relief. The lower court had ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not authorize the president to set unlimited tariffs. The White House hailed the appeals court's ruling as a positive development for American industries and workers.</p>

While West Point maintains that "duty, honor, country" remains its motto, critics argue the change undermines traditional values.

          <p>The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a federal lawsuit against the White House for failing to provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters at press briefings. The NAD argues that the absence of ASL interpreters violates the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment, depriving deaf individuals of meaningful access to government information. The lawsuit highlights that English closed captioning is insufficient for many deaf individuals who primarily communicate in ASL. This action follows a previous lawsuit in 2020 that mandated ASL interpreters for COVID-19 briefings.</p>
