          <p>Amanda and Nick Thomas are seeking assistance and information from other parents of children with the rare genetic condition affecting their 11-month-old son, Jack. Jack has a mutation of the PPFIBP1 gene, causing blindness and seizures, and is not expected to live past childhood. The family is trying to connect with other parents who have experienced similar situations to gain insight into the condition and offer mutual support, as there are only 16 known cases worldwide. The family's home renovations have stalled, and Nick is recovering from a stroke and heart surgery, adding to the challenges they face in providing for Jack's needs.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. His lawyer calls the charges "fantastical," alleging they are based on statements from individuals facing prosecution or already imprisoned. The US Supreme Court ordered Trump to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return after the deportation was deemed an "administrative error." Abrego Garcia's case has become a symbol of tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary, with some alleging the prosecution is politically motivated.</p>

Lee previously faced criticism for describing US Forces Korea as "occupation forces," indicating a potential shift in Seoul's foreign policy.

          <p>Japan and the United States are working to reach a mutually beneficial tariff agreement by mid-June, though significant differences remain on key issues. Despite ongoing negotiations, Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, indicated that a consensus has not yet been reached, particularly regarding the Trump administration's additional tariffs. Japan insists that these tariffs, which have negatively impacted the Japanese economy, should be removed as soon as possible. The leaders of both countries plan to meet during the upcoming Group of Seven summit in Canada to discuss the progress of these trade talks.</p>

          <p>A major furniture fraud case has rocked the French antiques world, involving the sale of fake 18th-century royal furniture to institutions like the Palace of Versailles. Antiques expert Georges "Bill" Pallot and cabinetmaker Bruno Desnoues admitted to forging chairs, deceiving experts and collectors. The scheme, which began as a "joke," allegedly generated millions in profits, highlighting the need for stricter regulation in the art market.

          <p>Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life requires more than just diet and exercise; it necessitates a collective responsibility fostered by public policy and community support. While individual optimization efforts are helpful, societal factors such as access to nutritious food, clean air, and preventive healthcare play a crucial role in determining health outcomes. Countries like Japan and South Korea, where healthy living is normalized by government and culture, demonstrate the importance of creating environments that support overall well-being. Therefore, focusing on public health initiatives and policies is essential for improving health and longevity for everyone.</p>
