          <p>An Israeli strike hit the Catholic Church of the Holy Family in Gaza City, killing three people and wounding several others, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the targeting of a sacred place sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians, both Christian and Muslim. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement expressing deep regret, calling the incident a mistake caused by stray ammunition and committing to an investigation. The event drew international condemnation and renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta board members have settled a class-action lawsuit brought by shareholders in connection with the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The lawsuit alleged that company leaders failed to disclose the risks of user data being misused and had violated a 2012 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. The settlement was reached just one day after the trial began, averting further court proceedings. Meta declined to comment on the terms of the settlement, noting the suit was against the directors personally, not the company itself.</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as “princess treatment,” where women expect partners to perform numerous acts of service, is explored as a cultural phenomenon. The article suggests these expectations, which range from basic courtesies to high-maintenance demands, may be an extreme reaction to the poor treatment many women have experienced or witnessed. Some psychologists and relationship experts argue that while it appears to empower women, the trend may actually promote passivity and traditional gender roles. It reflects a broader tension in modern heterosexual relationships where men and women often struggle to relate to one another's expectations.</p>

          <p>Connie Francis, a dominant female vocalist of the late 1950s and early 1960s with hits like "Who's Sorry Now" and "Stupid Cupid," has died at the age of 87. Her career saw a recent, unexpected resurgence when her 1962 song "Pretty Little Baby" went viral on TikTok. Francis's life was marked by immense success as well as profound tragedy, including surviving a violent sexual assault in 1974 that led to a period of reclusion and mental health struggles. She later became a prominent advocate for crime victims and mental health awareness before returning to performing.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is re-evaluating its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on luggage. This comes shortly after the agency immediately lifted the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during standard security screenings. The current rule, limiting liquids to 3.4-ounce containers, was implemented in 2006 after a foiled terrorist plot involving liquid explosives. The potential change is part of a broader effort to question and modernize TSA procedures, with new CT scanners that provide 3D imaging making such a policy shift more feasible.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is leading a controversial effort to potentially redraw the state's congressional district maps to gain more Democratic seats. This move is a direct response to a Republican plan in Texas, encouraged by Donald Trump, to redraw its maps to favor the GOP. Newsom's proposal faces significant legal and political hurdles, as California voters previously gave redistricting power to an independent commission to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The threat has sparked a debate within the Democratic party about whether to fight Republican hardball tactics with similar measures, even if it undermines democratic norms.</p>

          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued new guidance advising that children under the age of seven should not consume shop-bought slushy drinks. The warning is due to the presence of glycerol, a sugar substitute used to create the slushy texture, which can cause side effects like headaches, sickness, and in rare cases, shock in young children. The FSA also recommends that children aged seven to ten have no more than one 350ml slushy per day.

          <p>A major UK government data breach has compromised the identities of more than 100 British officials, including members of the elite SAS and MI6 intelligence agency. The data was inadvertently leaked when an employee emailed a database of nearly 19,000 Afghan resettlement applications to an individual outside of government. This error not only put UK personnel at risk but also the thousands of Afghans who had worked with the British and were seeking relocation, as they now face potential retribution from the Taliban. The discovery forced the government to covertly create a new resettlement route for those affected.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition described as benign and common, particularly in older individuals. The diagnosis came after the president noticed mild swelling in his legs, which had fueled public speculation about his health after recent photos showed swollen ankles. According to the president's physician, a comprehensive examination including vascular studies revealed no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure, and the president remains in excellent overall health.</p>

          <p>In a new interview, former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson described the moment he tried to shut down a passenger jet's engines mid-flight as occurring within a dissociative state. He claims he was convinced he was in a dream and needed to "wake up," an experience he attributes to taking "magic mushrooms" for the first time two days prior while grieving a friend's death. The frightening incident, which ended with the plane landing safely, has intensified the conversation around pilot mental health. It has prompted reviews by the FAA and a new bipartisan bill in Congress aimed at reducing barriers for pilots seeking mental health care.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to approve a Trump administration proposal to claw back $1.1 billion in previously allocated federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). This funding is critical for NPR and PBS affiliates across the country. Public media leaders have warned that the cuts will have a devastating impact, particularly on smaller, rural stations that rely on federal money for their operating budgets and to provide essential services like emergency alerts.

          <p>A new survey reveals that 23% of Americans over the age of 50 are now planning to delay their retirement, a significant increase from 14% in 2024. The primary drivers for this decision are economic concerns, including worries about inflation, a potential recession, and general financial readiness for their post-work years. This trend highlights the particular financial pressure on Generation X, many of whom are approaching the traditional retirement age with insufficient savings. The findings point to widespread anxiety about financial security in later life across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

A key dispute has erupted over whether booster-funded NIL collectives qualify as legitimate businesses for endorsement deals under the new rules. The group enforcing the settlement has taken a restrictive stance, which the plaintiffs' attorneys argue violates the agreement. This conflict threatens to undermine the entire system of "guardrails" and revenue caps that schools sought, raising questions about whether the settlement can survive its first legal tests.</p>

With a range of over 200 nautical miles, these missiles are intended to be a cost-effective option for deterring potential adversaries like China in the Pacific, a market currently dominated by larger contractors like Lockheed Martin and RTX.</p>

Zelenskyy stated the changes were necessary to effectively implement agreements with international partners. The reshuffle, which occurred while the country is under martial law, has drawn some procedural criticism from opposition figures but is seen by analysts as a move to inject new energy into the executive branch.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Empire of the Elite," examines the fall of media giant Condé Nast, the parent company of iconic magazines like Vogue, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair. The book chronicles how the company, once the ultimate arbiter of American taste and style, became a husk of its former self. The author argues that Condé Nast's decline was driven by its failure to adapt to the digital age and the rise of social media, which decentralized influence and made the company's top-down, authoritative model obsolete. The analysis provides a look into the shifting dynamics of the modern media landscape.</p>
