          <p>During a Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, a fan fell from the right-field bleachers, landing on the warning track and prompting immediate medical response. The incident occurred shortly after an RBI double by the Pirates' Andrew McCutchen, leading to a temporary delay in the game as players offered prayers. The fan was subsequently taken to a local hospital, and the Pirates organization expressed their support for the individual and their family. Police officers investigated the area from where the fan fell to discern the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed business leaders at the White House after the U.S. economy experienced a contraction of 0.3%, the first in three years, and he attributed the downturn to his predecessor, Joe Biden. Trump highlighted planned investments in technology, healthcare, and infrastructure, urging Congress to pass his tax bill. He downplayed fears of shortages due to the trade war with China, suggesting Americans might need to adjust their consumption habits. The economic contraction follows the implementation of Trump's import taxes, which have disrupted global trade and markets.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has accused Apple of willfully violating a 2021 injunction related to the Epic Games case and found that an Apple executive lied under oath about the company's App Store commission policies.

Despite the setback, analysts anticipate that Comac, the plane's manufacturer, will continue its efforts to expand into overseas markets, particularly in Southeast Asia.

Despite evidence that the tattoo was digitally added to a photograph, President Trump continued to assert its existence, raising questions about the administration's motives. Critics suggest that the administration is attempting to sway public opinion and justify its actions, even in the face of court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators have concluded a controlled fire in Pacific Palisades as part of their ongoing investigation into the cause of a January blaze that destroyed several homes and killed a dozen people. The controlled burn was conducted along the Temescal Ridge Trail to help determine the exact point of origin and how the fire spread rapidly during a windstorm. Investigators are exploring the possibility that the fire was reignited from an earlier blaze sparked by fireworks, although they have not ruled out other potential causes. Some homeowners have filed lawsuits against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, alleging negligence in wildfire preparedness and response.</p>

          <p>An effort to block President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs in the Senate fell short, highlighting divisions over the potential economic impact of the sweeping levies. The resolution, aimed at terminating the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, failed to garner enough Republican support, despite anxieties about disrupting the U.S. economy. While the vote was largely symbolic, it underscores ongoing concerns about the economic consequences of the tariffs, even as the administration maintains progress on trade deals. Economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, adding to the unease surrounding the tariff policy.</p>
