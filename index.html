        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's state Assembly has passed a controversial new congressional map backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, which aims to make five Republican-held seats more favorable to Democrats. This move is a direct response to a similar Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas, creating a contentious political battle between the nation's two most populous states. The plan, which critics call a partisan power grab, must now pass the state Senate and be approved by voters in a special election to circumvent the state's independent redistricting commission. Proponents argue it's a necessary countermeasure to protect democracy from Republican gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>Washington state's Department of Licensing is investigating how an undocumented immigrant obtained a commercial driver's license before being involved in a Florida crash that killed three people. The suspect, Harjinder Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2018, also held a commercial license from California and reportedly failed English proficiency and road sign tests after the accident. The incident has intensified the political debate over state licensing laws and immigration enforcement, particularly between the administrations of California's Governor Newsom and the federal government. The case highlights potential loopholes that allow noncitizens to receive commercial driving credentials.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the annual economic forum in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he will navigate a complex economic landscape. Powell faces the delicate task of addressing both political pressure from the Trump administration to cut interest rates and mixed economic data showing slowing job growth alongside rising inflation. Investors and economists will be closely watching for any signals regarding the Fed's next interest-rate decision in September, though Powell is expected to maintain a data-dependent stance. The speech is seen as a critical moment for the central bank's policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly two years into the war with Israel, Hamas is facing immense pressure from multiple fronts, including the Israeli military, Arab governments, and the civilian population in Gaza. According to analysts, the group's core strategy has shifted to ensuring its own survival by leveraging its remaining bargaining chip: the Israeli hostages. Hamas leadership appears to be banking on time, hoping that mounting international pressure on Israel, internal Israeli political turmoil, or military exhaustion will change the circumstances in their favor. This approach prioritizes existence over immediate victory, as the group withstands a severe crisis.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he has instructed his team to begin negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. However, this move was coupled with his cabinet's approval of military plans for a major assault on Gaza City, which he described as a necessary step to defeat Hamas. Netanyahu stated that the goals of defeating Hamas and freeing the hostages are interconnected, signaling a dual-track approach of diplomacy and military force. The announcement comes after Hamas agreed to a ceasefire proposal from mediators, which Israel has not yet accepted.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated his intention to personally go out with police and National Guard troops to patrol Washington, D.C., as part of a federal surge to address what he calls a crime emergency. The deployment, which Trump described as a potential model for other U.S. cities, has drawn sharp criticism from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called it politically motivated and disconnected from the city's actual crime statistics. While the administration claims hundreds of arrests have been made, local officials argue that crime rates are at a 30-year low and the federal presence is unnecessary.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a potential solution. To qualify for such programs, which involve negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount, borrowers typically need to meet specific criteria. These often include having a substantial amount of unsecured debt, usually over $7,500, and experiencing a significant financial hardship such as job loss or a medical emergency. Borrowers who are already delinquent on their payments are also more likely to be considered, as creditors become more willing to negotiate to avoid a total loss. (not investment advice)</p>

This approach, termed "America Everywhere," marks a shift from traditional diplomacy to a partisan strategy that undermines established alliances.

          <p>Chipotle has announced a partnership with drone delivery company Zipline to test an autonomous food delivery service for select customers in the Dallas, Texas area. In this pilot program, orders will be prepared at a local Chipotle, loaded into a Zipline aircraft, and delivered directly to customers' homes. The drone hovers at an altitude of 300 feet while a small robot lowers the food package to the ground. This initiative represents Chipotle's latest effort to innovate its delivery methods and appeal to a younger, tech-savvy consumer base, as the restaurant industry seeks new ways to drive sales.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by a hairstylist against sports commentator Skip Bayless and Fox Sports appears to be heading toward a settlement after the plaintiff requested its dismissal. The lawsuit alleged that Bayless made unwanted sexual advances and that she was forced to endure a misogynistic workplace culture. While the court initially rejected the dismissal request due to an attached class-action complaint, legal experts believe the filing is a strong indicator that the individual parties have reached a confidential agreement. The allegations in the suit had previously led to the termination of Bayless and two other high-profile employees.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has confirmed it will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, made by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, accuses Cook of potential mortgage fraud related to claims about her primary residence. This development occurs amid heightened political pressure on the Federal Reserve and its members from the Trump administration. In a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a DOJ attorney urged him to fire Cook, although Powell lacks the legal authority to do so.</p>

Menendez is arguing that he is rehabilitated and no longer a threat to public safety, maintaining that the murders were an act of self-defense after years of abuse. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office strongly opposes his release, asserting that he has never taken full responsibility for his actions.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly rose by 2% in July compared to the previous month, according to the National Association of Realtors. This increase is attributed to a significant rise in housing inventory, which climbed to its highest level since May 2020, giving buyers more options and helping to moderate price growth. The median home price saw only a slight 0.2% year-over-year increase, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point after a long period of rapid appreciation. The improved affordability and choice are beginning to draw some buyers back into the market. (not investment advice)</p>
