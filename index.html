          <p>The last group of seven Israeli hostages held by Hamas for over two years has been released, prompting an emotional response from their families. The family of Omri Miran described his return as a victory for the entire nation and thanked security forces for their efforts. The release coincided with the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump in Israel, where he is scheduled to address the Knesset before attending a peace summit in Egypt.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international summit to formalize the Gaza peace plan, where he is expected to credit U.S. President Donald Trump's role. The UK's involvement has been a point of contention, with a UK minister's claim of a "key role" being dismissed as "delusional" by the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Despite the friction, a U.S. envoy acknowledged the UK's assistance in coordinating efforts leading to the historic agreement.</p>

          <p>Second-year quarterback Drake Maye is showing signs of becoming the franchise player the New England Patriots have sought since Tom Brady's departure. After a strong road win against Buffalo, Maye delivered another impressive performance against the New Orleans Saints, finishing with 261 yards and three touchdowns. His improved composure, decision-making, and ability to make crucial throws under pressure have accelerated the team's timeline, turning the Patriots back into division contenders much sooner than anticipated.</p>

          <p>The European Union is implementing new strategies to address political disillusionment among its younger citizens, as surveys show a significant portion of Gen Z feels the EU is undemocratic or poorly implemented. Initiatives like "Youth Policy Dialogues" aim to involve young people directly in policymaking on issues they care about, such as cyberbullying. While officials believe these efforts can rebuild trust, some analysts note the EU's limited power in key youth-centric areas like housing and employment could hinder its ability to deliver tangible results.</p>

          <p>In a subtle but significant move amid ongoing trade tensions, China's Ministry of Commerce has begun issuing official documents exclusively in a format compatible only with WPS Office, a domestic alternative to Microsoft Office. This is the first time the ministry has departed from the widely used Microsoft Word format for key announcements, such as recent rare earth export controls. The change underscores Beijing's broader strategy to reduce reliance on American technology and promote its own software standards.</p>

          <p>Krone, a major European farm machinery company, has suspended exports of large equipment to the United States due to newly implemented and complex tariffs on steel derivative products. The new rules require an unprecedented level of documentation certifying the origin of all steel components, which the company describes as nearly impossible to provide. This development highlights the severe bureaucratic and financial challenges some European businesses are facing from U.S. trade policies, with the company's chairman noting that American customers will ultimately bear the cost.

The article contends that by normalizing these behaviors, the Speaker is failing in his constitutional duty to act as a check on executive power and is instead paving the way for one-man rule.</p>

While some cost is absorbed by sellers, data on import prices suggests foreign producers are not significantly lowering their prices, meaning the financial burden falls largely within the United States.
