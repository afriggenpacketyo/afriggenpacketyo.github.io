          <p>Gold prices have surged, reaching $3,500 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid trade turmoil and declining confidence in U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. Analysts attribute this shift to President Trump's trade policies, which have diminished the appeal of traditional U.S. assets. Unlike currencies or government bonds, gold carries no credit risk and is not tied to the economic or political trajectory of a single nation. J.P. Morgan forecasts gold prices to average $3,675 per ounce by the fourth quarter of 2025 and reach $4,000 by the second quarter of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

SK Hynix credited its first-quarter profits to AI's impact on the memory market and anticipates continued spending on AI by Big Tech.
