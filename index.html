            <p>The State Department informed a federal judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, is "alive and secure" but remains in a Terrorism Confinement Center. Despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return, the filing did not detail steps being taken to bring him back to the U.S. President Trump is scheduled to meet with El Salvador's President Bukele, raising questions about Garcia's situation given the administration's claims of Garcia's gang affiliations, which his lawyers deny, while he remains detained in El Salvador. The case has sparked controversy and legal battles over immigration enforcement and due process.</p>

            <p>President Trump directed the U.S. military to take control of a 60-foot strip of federal land along the southern border in California, New Mexico, and Arizona to combat illegal immigration. The memorandum designates the area as a "military installation" for activities including border-barrier construction and equipment deployment. Trump asserted that the border is under attack and requires a more direct military role, citing the complexity of the situation. The Roosevelt Reservation, established in 1907, will now be used to bolster border security efforts.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles judge denied District Attorney Nathan Hochman's request to block the resentencing of the Menéndez brothers, who were convicted of murdering their parents. The decision paves the way for a hearing that could potentially offer them a path to freedom, considering they committed the murders before turning 26. The case has garnered increased attention due to a Netflix documentary and new allegations of abuse against their father, which could support their claims of self-defense. The resentencing hearing is expected to be a media spectacle, with family members divided on whether the brothers should be released.</p>
