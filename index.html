          <h2>Researchers Propose Smoke-Dried Remains in Asia Are World's Oldest Mummies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 08:24:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that human remains found across southeastern Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years, may be the oldest known mummies. Researchers theorize that hunter-gatherer communities used a smoke-drying process over fire to preserve the bodies of their ancestors. This practice, far predating the well-known Egyptian or Chinchorro mummies, is believed to have sustained physical and spiritual connections with the deceased. The findings, though requiring more robust dating methods, offer significant insight into prehistoric funerary practices that continue in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is suing The New York Times for $15 billion, alleging a prolonged pattern of defamation and libel. The lawsuit, filed in Florida, specifically cites a book and three articles published during the 2024 presidential campaign, claiming they were crafted with "actual malice" to damage his reputation. In response, The New York Times has dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and an attempt to intimidate and stifle independent reporting. The paper stated it will continue its work and defend journalists' First Amendment rights without fear or favor.</p>

          <p>The Israeli Defense Forces have intensified their military campaign by expanding ground operations into the heart of Gaza City, a move described by military leaders as decisively important for the war's continuation. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry has called for urgent international intervention to protect civilians, accusing Israel of turning the city into a "mass graveyard." Meanwhile, a United Nations commission released a report concluding that Israel's actions amount to genocide, a finding the Israeli Foreign Ministry has rejected. The conflict's death toll continues to rise, with thousands killed and injured since it began.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that a trade agreement with China is likely to be reached before a November deadline for new reciprocal tariffs. In a recent interview, Bessent stated that talks have become increasingly productive and that Chinese officials now sense a deal is possible. The negotiations aim to address the significant U.S. trade deficit with China, which was nearly $300 billion in 2024. U.S. officials project the deficit will narrow by at least 30% this year, moving towards a more balanced and fair trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's willingness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that motivated China to negotiate a deal framework. With a September 17 deadline looming for parent company ByteDance to divest the app's U.S. operations, Bessent revealed that the commercial terms had been essentially agreed upon for months but were stalled by China after Trump's tariff announcements.

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation includes a "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for public bodies to fail to cooperate or act with honesty and integrity. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law, championed by families of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster victims, aims to end a "culture of cover-ups" and will serve victims of other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office scandal. Campaigners have welcomed the news, calling it a momentous step for British justice.</p>

          <p>Amid a cooling job market and economic uncertainty, a trend known as "job hugging" has emerged, where employees are clinging to their current positions rather than seeking new opportunities. The "quits" rate has fallen to its lowest sustained level since 2016, reflecting workers' fears of potential layoffs and the difficulty of finding new employment. Career experts advise that while staying put can provide security, it also carries the risk of complacency. They recommend that employees "pivot in place" by seeking internal growth, acquiring new skills, and expanding their professional networks to remain valuable and prepared for future opportunities.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of economists, fund managers, and strategists reveals that 82% believe President Trump's actions are an effort to limit or eliminate the Federal Reserve's independence. A majority of respondents predict this political pressure will lead to negative economic outcomes, including weaker growth, higher inflation, and a lower value for the U.S. dollar. While the Fed is expected to cut interest rates this week, there is significant disagreement among experts on whether this is the correct course of action. The survey highlights rising concerns about political interference in monetary policy and its potential to destabilize the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the current AI boom is poised to become the most efficient upward redistribution of wealth in modern history, making a few tech entrepreneurs unfathomably richer while threatening jobs across the labor market. The author contends that the massive valuations of AI startups are predicated on their potential to eliminate human labor, from computer programming to warehouse work. This trend exacerbates existing class divides and political polarization, as society prioritizes massive investments in high-tech development over essential, low-tech labor needed for infrastructure and community services. The article questions whether this path serves the common good or simply concentrates more power and wealth in the hands of a technological elite.</p>

          <p>Nurses in California are raising alarms about an increasing presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals, which they say interferes with patient care and creates a fearful environment. Following a Trump administration executive order that overturned the "sensitive locations" policy, nurses have reported agents blocking access to patients, violating privacy laws, and potentially deterring immigrants from seeking necessary medical help. Incidents include agents refusing to provide identification and forcibly removing a patient against a doctor's orders. Healthcare workers argue that allowing ICE undue access to medical facilities is both immoral and a threat to public health.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of Zionism, arguing that it should be understood as a complex 19th-century nationalist movement rather than a monolithic ideology. It traces the movement's origins to the 1897 congress in Basel, Switzerland, led by Theodor Herzl, highlighting the diverse viewpoints among early Zionists regarding statehood, religion, and political strategy. The author notes that, like other nationalist movements of its era, Zionism was multifaceted and often failed to adequately consider the existing Arab population in Palestine. The article concludes by emphasizing that viewing Zionism through its history reveals an ongoing internal debate over its identity and future, including progressive voices advocating for Palestinian statehood.</p>

The disciplinary panel deemed the action worthy of a red card, starting with an 18-game suspension that was reduced by six due to the player's remorse and admission of foul play.

          <p>This long-form article revisits the legendary 1975 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in the Philippines, widely regarded as one of the greatest fights in history. It explores the deep personal enmity that had curdled from an early friendship, fueled by Ali's vicious taunts and the high stakes of their rivalry. The piece also examines the political backdrop, with the fight being used as a propaganda tool by the autocratic regime of Ferdinand Marcos. The "Thrilla in Manila" is remembered not just for its brutal, elemental test of human endurance, but as a complex narrative of sport, society, and the souls of two iconic fighters.</p>

          <h2>The Killing of Charlie Kirk Intensifies the Contentious Debate Over the Meaning of Free Speech</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex and often contradictory nature of free speech, using the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's killing as a contemporary case study. It interviews historian Fara Dabhoiwala, who argues that free speech is not a timeless, absolute ideal but a historically shaped concept that is always dependent on power and context. The discussion delves into how speech is a form of action that can cause harm, and how the power to amplify certain voices is a critical but often overlooked aspect of the debate. The piece suggests that the digital age requires a more sophisticated understanding of free speech beyond a simple opposition to censorship.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Blocks President Trump from Firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:51:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled 2-1 that President Trump cannot remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, a significant blow to the administration. Trump had announced he was firing Cook, a Biden appointee, on grounds of alleged mortgage fraud, which she denies. The ruling allows Cook to participate in this week's pivotal policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. This case tests the long-standing independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference, as no president has ever removed a Fed governor, and the legal definition of removal "for cause" remains undefined.

          <p>A group of three individuals calling themselves the "Kingdom of Kubala" has been evicted by sheriff officers from privately-owned woodland near Jedburgh, Scotland. The group, who claim ancestral rights to the land, had ignored previous orders to leave their makeshift encampment. After being woken by officials and dismantling their tents, they simply moved their belongings a few meters away to a new site on the other side of a wire fence. The trio, who have gained a significant online following, have been in the area for several weeks, creating a peculiar standoff with local authorities and the landowner.</p>

          <p>The man arrested for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appeared to claim responsibility for the shooting in messages to friends on the Discord platform. According to a company spokesperson and law enforcement sources, an account belonging to Robinson posted, "It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this." The messages were reportedly sent shortly before he was persuaded by his father to surrender to authorities. While investigators are still establishing a motive, an FBI official stated that a text message exchange was found on Robinson's phone indicating his intent to target Kirk.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Reverses Cuts to Winter Fuel Payments After Number of Recipients Plunged</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:39:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures show that the number of UK pensioners receiving winter fuel payments dropped from around 11 million to just 1.3 million last year after the government introduced means-testing. The controversial policy, which restricted payments to those on low-income benefits, sparked a significant backlash. In response, the chancellor announced a U-turn in June, restoring the payment for pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less. This reversal means that more than three-quarters of pensioners, or about nine million people, will again receive the payment of up to £300 this winter to help with high energy bills.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Solve Color Mystery in Jackson Pollock's "Number 1A, 1948"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:31:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have scientifically confirmed the source of a vibrant turquoise blue color in Jackson Pollock's famous 1948 painting, "Number 1A." By analyzing paint scrapings with lasers, they created a chemical fingerprint identifying the pigment as manganese blue, a synthetic color phased out in the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific pigment. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, not only solves an artistic mystery but also demonstrates how scientific analysis helps in the conservation and authentication of valuable artworks.</p>
