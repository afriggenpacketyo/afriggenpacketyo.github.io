        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, have jointly accused Israel of "weaponizing aid" in Gaza, contributing to deepening starvation. They assert that stricter Israeli regulations, implemented since March, have led to numerous denials for aid deliveries, leaving hospitals without essential supplies and vulnerable populations facing hunger. Israel, however, denies restricting aid, maintaining that the rules are crucial to prevent supplies from reaching Hamas and states that roughly 300 trucks are entering Gaza daily. Despite this, aid groups contend that the new registration process undermines their operational independence and ability to advocate for the affected population.</p>

          <p>Singapore, known for financial prudence, is seeing a growing number of its workers, now 60%, living paycheck to paycheck, a rise from 53% in 2021 and higher than the Asia-Pacific average. This trend is attributed to rising living costs, including expensive housing and imports, which have outpaced income growth since the pandemic. Experts also note a cultural shift where younger generations prioritize experiences and instant gratification over long-term savings, with "buy now, pay later" schemes contributing to increased debt. This situation highlights a complex interplay of macroeconomic factors and evolving societal values.</p>

          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record-breaking $6.1 billion, making it the largest sale price ever for an American professional sports team. Chisholm will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with full control expected by 2028, potentially raising the total value to $7.3 billion. This transaction surpasses previous records set by the NFL's Washington Commanders and the NBA's Phoenix Suns. The previous ownership group, led by Wyc Grousbeck, purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million and oversaw two NBA championships.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has concluded a six-year legal dispute, ruling that Pinkfong's global hit "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize a version by US composer Jonathan Wright. The court upheld lower court decisions, stating Wright's 2011 rendition of the children's folk song, which is in the public domain, lacked sufficient originality to be protected by copyright. Pinkfong's 2016 adaptation became a viral sensation, achieving billions of YouTube views and inspiring various adaptations. This verdict confirms that the popular tune is an arrangement of a public domain folk song, not an infringement on Wright's interpretation.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has directed state police to launch a criminal investigation into allegations that staff at Centreville High School in Fairfax County arranged abortions for students, including a 17-year-old, without parental consent and potentially used public funds. The Fairfax County Public Schools system initiated its own external investigation into the 2021 claims, stating such actions would be unacceptable. Pro-life groups have condemned the alleged "secretly arranged" procedures, calling for accountability for all officials involved in what they describe as state-funded child exploitation. This article highlights the serious legal and ethical questions surrounding the accusations.</p>

          <p>BTecs are practical UK qualifications assessed through exams, coursework, and projects, serving as alternatives or complements to GCSEs (Level 2) and A-levels (Level 3). Many students use BTec Nationals as a route to university or direct employment, with popular subjects including health and social care. Recent government plans to streamline post-16 education initially threatened BTec funding in favor of T-levels, but the Labour government has paused and reviewed these plans, saving 157 "key courses" from defunding. This ensures that a broader range of vocational pathways remains available for students, addressing concerns about educational diversity.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Lai, a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon, is in the final stages of his national security trial, accused of colluding with foreign forces under Beijing's imposed law. The 77-year-old, a British and Chinese citizen, faces a potential life sentence, with critics arguing the case weaponizes Hong Kong's legal system to suppress dissent. Lai, a "born rebel" who built a media empire, became a fierce critic of Beijing after the Tiananmen Square massacre. His son, Sebastien, has urged international leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump, to press for his father's release, citing his deteriorating health.</p>

This statement contradicts South Korea's assessment that some speakers were dismantled, and dashes Seoul's hopes for renewed dialogue.

          <p>On August 14-15, 1945, less than 12 hours before Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's unconditional surrender, US B-29 bombers firebombed Kumagaya, Japan, killing at least 260 people and destroying 75% of the city. Survivors recount the horror, with one born that day describing flames devouring the city. US commanders had justified the mission as a "final knockout blow," but aircrews were eager for a surrender signal. The article reflects on the "utterly foolish" tragedy of the final raid, with survivors expressing no animosity towards America but questioning the momentum of war.</p>

          <p>First lady Melania Trump has issued a demand for Hunter Biden to retract comments linking her to sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, threatening a lawsuit if he fails to comply. Biden, in a recent interview, alleged that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim her lawyer, Alejandro Brito, labels as "false, defamatory and extremely salacious." The statements, widely disseminated, have allegedly caused "overwhelming financial and reputational harm." The Trumps maintain they were introduced by a modeling agent in 1998, and this legal threat mirrors the former President's strategy of using litigation against critics.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported a significant increase in Chikungunya virus cases, with over 70 infections in the first half of this year—more than double the previous year. All reported cases are travel-related, primarily linked to an ongoing outbreak in the Indian Ocean region, including India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne virus can cause severe fever and joint pain that may persist for years. The UKHSA is urging travelers to high-risk areas to take precautions against mosquito bites, such as using repellent and bed nets, and to consider vaccination.</p>

While visa-free travel was discussed, it will be addressed in a separate, unconfirmed subsidiary agreement. This pact underscores Australia's commitment to its Pacific neighbors, following similar recent agreements with the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Papua New Guinea, emphasizing a "shared destiny" and long-term regional stability.</p>

This move, which could benefit companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, has drawn strong criticism from environmental groups.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump can continue to freeze or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid that Congress had appropriated, reversing a lower court's preliminary injunction. The 2-to-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated that the international aid groups challenging the freeze lacked legal standing to sue. This ruling supports the administration's stance that foreign aid spending on global health and development programs is "wasteful." The dissenting judge argued the decision failed to address the constitutional implications of the President refusing to spend congressionally allocated funds based on policy disagreements.
