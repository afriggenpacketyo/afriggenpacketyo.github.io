          <p>The United States is reportedly considering deporting migrants to Libya, a move that has sparked controversy due to the country's ongoing conflict and human rights concerns. According to CBS News, US officials suggest the US military might conduct these flights as early as this week. Libya is currently mired in conflict, and the US State Department advises against travel there due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. This plan has drawn criticism from legal experts who argue that sending migrants to Libya would violate both US and international law due to the unsafe conditions and human rights abuses prevalent in the country. The US State Department has been approached for comment, but has not responded.</p>

Raducanu overcame a tough challenge in a three-set match, demonstrating resilience after a month-long break from competitive tennis.

Boulter, however, struggled to replicate her recent form and lost her match despite Pavlyuchenkova's recent losing streak.

Dr. Means has gained prominence for her views on the food and drug industry, aligning with Kennedy's claims about unhealthy food and lifestyle choices impacting Americans' health.

          <p>Top advisers to President Trump, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have proposed a plan for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. This fund, requested by Trump earlier in the year, aims to invest assets, potentially from sources like natural resources, to generate public revenue. However, the White House has expressed concerns about the proposed approach, leading to ongoing debates about the fund's mechanics. While details remain under discussion and no immediate announcement is expected, the administration affirms its commitment to safeguarding America's national and economic security. Trump has previously suggested that the fund could acquire a stake in TikTok.</p>

          <p>In a Memphis courtroom, three former police officers, Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean, and Justin Smith, were acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols. This verdict follows a federal trial where the officers were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of civil rights violations causing death, with Haley found guilty of civil rights violations causing bodily injury. The state jury, seated from outside Memphis to ensure impartiality, deliberated for over eight hours after a seven-day trial. The case has sparked outrage and renewed calls for police reform, with civil rights lawyers denouncing the verdict as a miscarriage of justice.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to deport immigrants to Libya is facing legal challenges due to concerns over human rights violations in Libyan detention centers. Legal experts argue that sending immigrants to Libya would violate US and international law, specifically the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits sending individuals to places where they face persecution and danger. The administration's plans have been met with denials from both of Libya's rival governments, further complicating the situation. A federal judge has ruled that the deportations would defy a court order requiring immigrants to have a meaningful opportunity to appeal their deportations.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain interest rates, adopting a cautious approach as it evaluates the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on inflation and economic growth. This decision marks the third consecutive meeting where rates have remained unchanged, keeping them between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the increasing uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook and the rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation. The central bank is hesitant to lower rates preemptively due to concerns that tariffs could reignite inflation, complicating the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining a healthy labor market and stable prices.</p>

          <p>Washington Governor Bob Ferguson has signed a rent control bill into law, establishing limits on rent increases across the state. The new law caps rent increases at 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower, and includes single-family homes and manufactured homes. The measure is intended to provide stability for renters and address the state's homelessness crisis. Senator Emily Alvarado, the bill's sponsor, emphasized that housing is a basic human need and that the law will protect hardworking families and older adults from excessive rent increases. Ferguson also signed nine other bills to support homeowners and renters.</p>

          <p>AppLovin's stock experienced a significant increase after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, coupled with the announcement of the sale of its mobile gaming business. The company will sell its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash and a 20% ownership stake in Tripledot. While AppLovin anticipates lower sales for the second quarter, the first-quarter net income rose substantially compared to the same period last year. This strategic move allows AppLovin to focus on its core advertising technology business.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced its wettest May on record after a storm system brought four consecutive days of rain to the city. The rare weather event caused widespread flooding, including a river flowing through a hotel parking garage, and tragically, a man was swept away by floodwaters in Henderson. The unusual rainfall, attributed to a low-pressure system interacting with moisture from the Pacific Ocean, has broken records dating back to 1937. While the region is forecast to return to dry and warmer conditions, the event highlights the increasing intensity of weather events.</p>

          <p>In an Arizona courtroom, an AI-generated version of a deceased man, Chris Pelkey, addressed his killer during the sentencing hearing. Pelkey's family used AI technology to recreate him using voice recordings, videos, and pictures, allowing him to deliver a victim impact statement. The AI version of Pelkey expressed forgiveness towards his killer, Gabriel Horcasitas, who was sentenced to 10-and-a-half years in prison. While the judge praised the use of AI, some experts raise ethical concerns about the potential misuse and fidelity of AI recreations in legal settings. The words spoken by the AI version were written by the victim's sister, based on her understanding of his forgiving nature.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article explores how businesses are navigating price increases due to President Trump's tariffs. Some companies are transparently attributing price hikes to tariffs, while others are opting for more ambiguous explanations like "changes in market conditions." The gaming industry, for example, has announced price increases for accessories, citing market conditions, while Ford is touting its American-made vehicles. Small businesses, particularly those relying on imported goods, face tough decisions about how to absorb or pass on the increased costs, often with limited options.</p>
