          <p>The gunman who killed four people in a Manhattan office building had a valid Nevada concealed carry permit, issued despite a documented history of mental health incidents. He purchased the AR-15 style rifle used in the attack from a coworker in Las Vegas and legally bought a handgun with his permit. The incident highlights the complexities of state-by-state gun laws, as New York's stricter regulations were ineffective against a weapon transported from a state with more lenient policies. This has reignited calls from New York officials for a national assault weapon ban to address such interstate loopholes.</p>

This sets a new state record for the most executions in a single year since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Zakrzewski's final appeals were denied, though opponents of the execution noted his military service and the non-unanimous 7-5 jury recommendation for his death sentence. Governor Ron DeSantis has already signed warrants for two more executions scheduled for August, continuing the state's record pace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House's East Wing, with a capacity for 650 guests. The project, estimated to cost around $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, not by congressional appropriation. The new facility is intended to host major state functions without the need for temporary tents, which are currently used for large events. Construction is set to begin in September, with the new structure designed to be architecturally consistent with the historic main building.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing structure amid criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), arguing that the cost of a FICO score is not impeding homeownership. The FHFA recently allowed mortgage lenders to use rival VantageScore, ending FICO's exclusive use for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with the agency head calling FICO a monopoly. Lansing countered that FICO's model is more predictive and has a dominant market share in non-government-mandated markets, asserting that the FHFA's move raises safety and soundness concerns for the mortgage industry.

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that he became upset with Epstein for "stealing" employees, including Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, Giuffre's family questioned whether this meant Trump was aware of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal activities at the time. The White House responded by stating the president had kicked Epstein out of his club for inappropriate behavior toward female staff, while Trump himself said he didn't know why Epstein was hiring his employees.</p>

The visit comes amid a dire humanitarian crisis, with widespread hunger and a rising death toll among civilians seeking assistance. President Trump has stated the U.S. and Israel will partner on new food centers, with Israel overseeing distribution to ensure it is proper. This move follows criticism of the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and calls from Democratic senators to cease its funding and resume support for UN-led aid mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant claiming to have invented the French dip sandwich, has postponed its planned closure by 45 days. The decision follows a massive outpouring of community support and a significant surge in customers after the initial closing announcement. The owner cited the overwhelming response and advocacy from local groups as the reason for striking a deal with the landlord to remain open longer. While the extension provides temporary relief and keeps staff employed, the owner stated it is unlikely to be a permanent solution due to ongoing business challenges.</p>

According to government data, over 113,000 hectares of forest were lost, reversing a positive trend from 2023 which had seen the lowest levels in over two decades. Officials attribute the spike to land-grabbing for cattle farming, illegal construction, cultivation of illicit crops like coca, and wildfires intensified by climate change.

          <h2>Federal Judges Publicly Detail Rise in Threats and Harassment</h2>

          <p>In a rare public appearance, a group of federal judges described a disturbing increase in threats and harassment they have faced, particularly after rulings involving the Trump administration. The judges shared experiences including credible death threats, hundreds of intimidating messages, and a harassment campaign known as "pizza doxxing," where pizzas were sent to their homes in the name of a murdered judge's son. They attributed the rise in hostile rhetoric to attacks from political leaders, which they believe emboldens individuals to threaten the judiciary. The judges called for political leaders to tone down inflammatory language to protect the rule of law.</p>

          <p>During an emotional public hearing, survivors of the deadly July 4 floods in central Texas criticized the disorganized response from local officials. Lawmakers questioned why key Kerr County emergency officials were unavailable as the unpredicted floodwaters rose, killing over 130 people. Survivors, including one who lost her parents and daughter, pleaded for better warning systems. Local officials defended their actions, citing communication failures in remote areas and the suddenness of the event, while detailing harrowing rescue attempts by first responders in the face of the rapidly rising river.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stated that Israel is in danger of becoming internationally isolated and that Germany has a responsibility to help prevent it. During a visit to Jerusalem, he described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as "beyond imagination" and urged Israel to show it is not pursuing a policy of expulsion or annexation. Wadephul emphasized Israel's duty to allow sufficient aid into Gaza to prevent mass deaths. The visit comes as a U.S. special envoy also prepares to visit Gaza to inspect aid distribution amid the worsening crisis.</p>

          <p>Following a Los Angeles Times investigation, City Councilmember Traci Park has introduced a motion to compel the city to comply with a 2019 state law requiring an analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The investigation found that L.A. had not publicly produced the required analysis of the capacity, safety, and viability of routes in high-risk areas. The city's planning department had cited terrorism concerns for not publicizing the routes, a claim the law's author called dubious. Park's motion demands a report on evacuation routes in her vulnerable district and a timeline for city-wide compliance.</p>

          <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an international activist group, has alleged that U.S. labor organizer Chris Smalls was physically assaulted by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) after an aid ship was intercepted. Smalls, a co-founder of the Amazon Labor Union, was on the ship Handala, which was attempting to breach the blockade to deliver food and medicine to Gaza. The coalition claims soldiers choked and kicked Smalls, who was one of 21 people detained.

          <p>Singer Chris Brown is facing a trademark infringement lawsuit from a swimwear company over the name of his current tour, "Breezy Bowl XX." The brand, Breezy Swimwear, claims it has held the rights to the "Breezy Bowl" name for its annual fashion event since 2023 and that the tour's name and merchandise create market confusion. The lawsuit, filed in Florida, seeks an injunction to stop Brown from using the name and demands monetary damages equal to the profits made from the alleged infringement. This legal challenge emerges as the U.S. leg of Brown's world tour begins.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team faced a significant setback as pace bowler Chris Woakes suffered a shoulder injury on the first day of the final Test against India. Woakes was injured while attempting to stop a boundary and left the field in visible discomfort, with his arm in a makeshift sling. Teammates expressed concern that the injury looks serious, making it unlikely he will participate further in the decisive match. The injury is a major blow to England's already depleted bowling attack and raises concerns about the 36-year-old's future in international cricket.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that new federal student loan limits will create significant financial barriers for students pursuing professional degrees in fields like medicine, law, and dentistry. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act caps federal loans for professional students at $50,000 per year, leaving a substantial funding gap for tuition at many universities, which can exceed $60,000 annually. The author contends this will disproportionately affect working-class students who lack access to private loans, potentially worsening shortages of essential professionals like doctors and public interest lawyers. The article calls on states like California to create their own loan programs to fill the gap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis from Vox argues that recent agreements between elite universities like Columbia and Brown and the Trump administration are setting a dangerous precedent for academic freedom. To restore withheld federal funding, these schools have agreed to administration demands, including slashing DEI programs, reviewing curricula, and cracking down on student protests. Critics say these institutions, despite having large endowments, are capitulating to political coercion, creating a roadmap for other, less-resourced universities to follow. The deals are seen as compromising institutional autonomy and chilling free speech and dialogue across all of higher education.</p>
