          <h2>LAFC Seeks Redemption in Rivalry Match Against LA Galaxy After Club World Cup Disappointment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 02:46:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a disappointing Club World Cup performance and a subsequent MLS loss, LAFC aims to regain momentum and reconnect with its fanbase in a crucial derby against archrival LA Galaxy. Despite recent league victories, coach Steve Cherundolo emphasizes that past statistics hold no weight in this passionate rivalry, where numbers are set aside for 90 minutes of intense competition. LAFC faces significant injuries, including a season-ending one, while the Galaxy, currently at the bottom of the Western Conference, are also looking to rebound. This highly anticipated match, potentially Cherundolo's last regular-season derby, is a critical opportunity for LAFC to demonstrate their renewed form and commitment to their supporters before the upcoming Leagues Cup.</p>

          <p>Deborah Mason, known as 'Gangsta Debbs' or 'Queen Bee,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating an £80 million drug empire that involved her four children, sister, and other close associates. The 65-year-old grandmother funded a lavish lifestyle, including designer goods for her cat, through an extensive cocaine supply network operating across south-east England. Police surveillance over seven months documented her direct involvement in numerous drug pickups and deliveries, handling at least 356kg of cocaine. The judge condemned Mason for corrupting her family and leading this highly profitable criminal enterprise, emphasizing the severe consequences for all involved.</p>

          <p>The Syrian interim President's office announced the deployment of a new force to halt deadly sectarian clashes between Bedouin and Druze fighters in the southern city of Suweida, urging restraint from all parties. Over 700 people have reportedly been killed since the violence erupted, with government troops accused of killing Druze civilians and carrying out extrajudicial executions. Amidst the escalating conflict, a US ambassador reported a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria, though neither nation has publicly confirmed it. The UN human rights chief has also condemned the widespread violations, including summary executions, and called for an immediate end to the bloodshed and accountability for those responsible.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a groundbreaking, more affordable, and simpler method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a highly specialized and personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. This innovative approach allows anti-cancer cells to be produced directly inside the human body using gene therapy tools, significantly reducing the current cost, which can exceed $139,200 per treatment. A team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology has already successfully used this method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, the second most common form of blood cancer. This breakthrough also shows promise for treating conditions like asthma and autoimmune diseases, potentially revolutionizing access to advanced therapies.</p>

This warning follows a recent heatwave that parched the ground, significantly increasing the risk and severity of flooding as the dry earth cannot absorb the rapid rainfall. Authorities advise residents in affected areas, including London and Cambridge, to prepare for challenging conditions, as homes and businesses are likely to be flooded quickly.</p>

This trend is emptying towns like Fregona, where the mayor fears the closure of primary schools will lead to communities dying out as young families leave. Despite government efforts to encourage childbirth through allowances and tax breaks, these measures are proving insufficient due to high childcare costs and career considerations. Experts argue that significant changes to services, rather than just cash handouts, and increased immigration are necessary to sustain the population and economy.</p>

This outing, his second since returning from injury, suggests he might finally be overcoming his past issues, which is crucial for the Dodgers' World Series aspirations.

          <p>The Trump administration announced it would facilitate the return of former detainees from El Salvador's CECOT prison to the US from Venezuela, if required by court, following assurances from the Maduro regime. This development comes after over 250 Venezuelan migrants were released as part of a prisoner exchange for American prisoners. Separately, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended against Trump administration allegations of mismanagement regarding the Fed headquarters renovation, providing detailed explanations of oversight and project scope. Additionally, President Trump continued to criticize Powell for high interest rates, claiming they are harming the housing market and calling him "one of my worst appointments."</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals strong public favor for the United States returning to the moon and eventually embarking on a mission to Mars, with about two-thirds of Americans supporting these endeavors. Younger Americans, who did not witness the initial moon landing, show particular enthusiasm for future space exploration within their lifetimes. The 1969 moon landing continues to be widely regarded as a worthwhile achievement, with a large majority affirming its value. This broad support for space initiatives, which also contributes to national pride and technological advancements, cuts across ideological and party lines, highlighting a shared national interest in exploration.</p>

          <p>China's open-source AI models, notably DeepSeek's V3 large language model and R1 reasoning model, are sending shock waves through Silicon Valley by offering a viable alternative to closed-off systems from US tech giants. Unlike OpenAI's restricted access, Chinese firms have embraced an open-source approach, allowing developers worldwide to use, modify, and distribute their models. This strategy has not only unleashed a wave of AI applications within China but also redefined the global AI landscape, fostering collaborative development. Analysts suggest these free-to-use models pose a serious challenge to US counterparts, potentially shifting the global AI power balance and promoting wider access to advanced AI.</p>

          <h2>California Workplace Safety Agency Critically Understaffed, Audit Reveals</h2>

          <p>A state audit has revealed "critical weakness" in California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), stating the agency lacks sufficient staff to protect the state's 19 million workers. The audit found a 32% vacancy rate, leading to the closure of workplace complaints and accident reports without adequate investigation or explanation. Problems include insufficient documentation during inspections and reduced fines without clear rationale, indicating a failure to adequately enforce safety standards. Workplace safety experts emphasize the need for major investment to address the chronic understaffing and ensure proper oversight, especially with growing responsibilities due to climate-change-induced extreme heat conditions for workers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, Dow Jones, and two Wall Street Journal reporters over an article claiming he sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, which allegedly included a sketch of a naked woman. The lawsuit asserts the article falsely linked him to Epstein with "salacious language" and misleadingly claimed he drew and signed the explicit content. The Journal's publisher, Dow Jones, stands by the "rigor and accuracy" of its reporting, vowing to vigorously defend against the suit, as Trump continues to pressure for the release of Epstein's investigative files.</p>
