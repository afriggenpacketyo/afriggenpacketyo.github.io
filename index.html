This push is facilitated by zero-tariff policies and leverages uncertainty around U.S. trade relations, allowing Chinese companies to secure long-term supply agreements.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its ongoing investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The committee, led by Republican James Comer, is seeking information regarding Epstein's activities and the federal government's handling of his case. The move is part of a broader bipartisan inquiry that has also summoned former top officials from the Department of Justice and the FBI.</p>

          <h2>Great Barrier Reef Experiences Record-Breaking Annual Decline in Coral Cover</h2>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that Australia's Great Barrier Reef has suffered its largest annual decline in coral cover since record-keeping began nearly four decades ago. The unprecedented loss is a direct result of the most severe and widespread coral bleaching event ever recorded, which was driven by extreme ocean heat stress from climate change. Scientists are warning that the iconic reef is approaching a critical tipping point, threatening its ability to recover.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell have filed a motion opposing the Department of Justice's attempt to unseal grand jury testimony related to her sex trafficking case. They argue that releasing the documents would violate Maxwell's due process rights, as she is still alive and pursuing an appeal of her conviction. The lawyers distinguished her situation from that of the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, stating the public's interest in his case cannot justify intruding on the secrecy of a case where the defendant's legal options remain viable.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, leading to a drop in its stock price. Although the company's overall revenue of $7.69 billion topped estimates, its AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export restrictions that eliminated sales of its MI308 chip to China. CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic about future AI growth, highlighting the competitiveness of AMD's next-generation chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating more than $4 billion in FEMA funds originally designated for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling sides with 20 states that sued after the administration terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that redirecting the money, intended for projects like flood prevention, could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters.</p>
