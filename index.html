          <p>Elon Musk's company, xAI, has secured a permit to operate 15 natural gas-burning turbines for its supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, despite significant local opposition over air quality concerns. The permit, issued by the Shelby County Health Department, includes emissions limits and potential fines for non-compliance. Residents have reported poor air quality since the turbines began operating, and the company faces a lawsuit from the NAACP over alleged Clean Air Act violations. xAI maintains that the facility will use state-of-the-art emissions control technology, making it the lowest-emitting of its kind.</p>

          <p>With the Fourth of July celebrations approaching, pet experts offer guidance on how to manage canine anxiety caused by loud fireworks. Recommendations include exercising dogs earlier in the day, providing mental stimulation with toys like frozen Kongs, and creating a safe, secure space for them at home. The article, drawing advice from Canine Companions, strongly advises against taking dogs to fireworks displays due to their sensitive hearing. These proactive measures can help ensure a less stressful holiday for both dogs and their owners.</p>

          <p>A Beijing-based think tank from Tsinghua University has recommended that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds to swap for the hidden debts of local governments. This measure aims to mitigate financial risks, restore local fiscal capabilities, and stimulate economic growth. Researchers argue that high local government debt is a primary obstacle to the country's economic and financial stability. The proposal suggests this comprehensive fiscal package is necessary to resolve the interconnected crises in local debt and the property market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has put 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a public letter criticizing the Trump administration's environmental policies. The "Declaration of Dissent" letter, signed by over 600 people in total, accused the administration of promoting harmful deregulation and disregarding scientific expertise. An EPA spokesperson stated the agency has a "zero-tolerance policy" for what it called career bureaucrats undermining the administration's agenda. The employees will be on leave for two weeks pending an investigation, a move that highlights growing tensions within the agency.</p>

The comet, currently 420 million miles away, was detected using a telescope in Chile and poses no threat to Earth. It is traveling at 37 miles per second and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Astronomers are now monitoring the object to determine its size and composition, offering a rare opportunity to study material from outside our solar system.</p>

Employers could then contribute a portion of this cost, significantly lowering the out-of-pocket expense for employees.

According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate also fell slightly to 4.1%. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the healthcare sector also saw significant gains. Despite uncertainty over trade and fiscal policy, the solid employment data suggests the Federal Reserve will likely maintain current interest rates for now. Previous months' figures were also revised upward, further indicating a stable job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The landmark spending bill signed by President Trump introduces several new tax breaks, four of which are temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of his term in 2028. These include new federal income tax deductions for tips and overtime pay, both of which were key campaign promises. The bill also allows for a deduction on interest paid for new auto loans and creates "Trump accounts," a new type of government-seeded savings vehicle for children born between 2025 and 2028. The temporary nature of these provisions creates future uncertainty for taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A skydiving plane carrying 15 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring everyone on board. Three individuals are reported to be in critical condition. Officials said the pilot reported engine trouble at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet and attempted an emergency landing. The plane, a Cessna 208B, landed on the runway but overran it into a wooded area. The same aircraft was involved in a previous landing incident in Virginia in 2023, according to an NTSB report.</p>

          <p>In a satirical column, The Atlantic imagines a conversation with the Founding Fathers as they observe the chaotic process behind the passage of the recent Republican mega-bill. The piece humorously contrasts their original vision of careful deliberation with the modern reality of all-night votes, presidential threats, and last-minute deal-making. The fictionalized James Madison "perfectly" describes the 940-page bill as awful, costly, and passed through questionable maneuvers. The satire critiques the current state of American governance, suggesting the legislative branch has abdicated its role as a coequal branch of government.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals shocking new details in the murder of his wife, Suzanne. The indictment alleges that her remains, found in a shallow grave, were moved there after her body had already decomposed elsewhere. Furthermore, tests on her bone marrow found a chemical compound used to tranquilize wildlife, a substance Barry Morphew had access to and admitted to using on deer. This evidence suggests her death was not immediate, as her body had begun to metabolize the drug. Barry Morphew was re-arrested and charged with first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>A man who was recently arrested in Madera County for impersonating a U.S. Marshal was shot and killed by sheriff's deputies in San Luis Obispo County. Authorities say Andrew Biscay, 40, was confronted by deputies after a woman reported he was near her home and had a history of violence. When deputies located him, Biscay allegedly exited his vehicle and aimed what appeared to be a handgun at them, prompting them to open fire. The weapon was later identified as a realistic-looking pellet gun. His previous arrest had uncovered a fake U.S. Marshal jacket, a self-made firearm, and zip ties.</p>

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which runs the US- and Israel-backed sites, has categorically denied the allegations.

          <p>A new report from NPR examines China's determined efforts to become the global leader in two critical technology sectors: artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. In AI, China's advantage may come from its vast control over the data necessary for training advanced models, potentially dictating the pace of global innovation. Meanwhile, in the electric vehicle market, the country is experiencing an intense price war among domestic manufacturers. These parallel developments underscore China's strategic focus on securing a dominant position in the key industries of the future.</p>

He used the "magic minute," a privilege granted to party leaders, to delay the final vote on the Republican's massive tax and spending bill. During the marathon speech, Jeffries vehemently criticized the legislation as an "immoral document" that would harm millions of Americans through cuts to healthcare and nutrition assistance. The move served as a high-profile protest, giving Democrats a spotlight to voice their opposition.</p>

          <p>A new study led by researchers at the University of London estimates that the true number of Palestinians killed in the Gaza war is substantially higher than figures reported by the Gazan Ministry of Health. By surveying households directly, researchers calculated over 80,000 total deaths by early January 2025, a figure that includes both violent and nonviolent war-related fatalities. The study, which is independent of Hamas-run ministry records, suggests official reports are a conservative minimum and not an exaggeration. It also found that women, children, and the elderly account for well over half of the violent deaths.</p>
