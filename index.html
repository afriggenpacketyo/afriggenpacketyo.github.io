            <p>Despite expectations of economic difficulties resulting from the escalating tariff war between the United States and China, many Chinese citizens are expressing strong support for their government's retaliatory measures. Chinese respondents conveyed frustration and resolve, viewing the U.S. tariffs as a targeted attack regardless of China's actions. The Chinese government has implemented tariffs on U.S. products, emphasizing its commitment to fight 'to the end' while advocating for equal and respectful dialogue to resolve conflicts. This stance reflects a shift from earlier trade disputes when opinions within China were more divided.</p>

            <p>A chaotic incident unfolded in Eagle Rock after a homeowner, Jillian Shriner, fired a handgun at individuals fleeing a car crash, leading to her being shot by police. The incident began with a crash on the 134 Freeway, after which three suspects fled into a nearby neighborhood. Shriner, identified as the wife of Weezer's bassist, reportedly pointed a gun at officers who were searching for the suspects, resulting in the police shooting her. She was subsequently absentee-booked on suspicion of attempted murder and is being held on $1 million bail.</p>

            <p>Local elections in England, while often lacking the glamour of national polls, are crucial for determining the quality and funding of local services. These elections also serve as a national barometer, reflecting public sentiment toward the government and major political parties. Key areas to watch include Lincolnshire, where Reform UK is hoping for breakthroughs, and Nottinghamshire, a bellwether area testing support for the Conservatives. The outcomes of these elections will likely have a significant impact on national politics, influencing party strategies and leadership decisions.</p>

Forecasters predict reduced global growth, with China potentially missing its growth target and Germany facing recession.

He emphasized the need for collective action to address the simultaneous breakdown in economic and geopolitical orders, drawing from lessons learned during the 2008 financial crisis.

            <p>Analysts caution that Donald Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations is merely a 'tactical retreat' and does not signal a fundamental shift in his trade objectives. Despite the pause, tariffs on Chinese imports have been raised to 125%, intensifying the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Experts express concern over the potential disruption to global supply chains and the chaotic nature of the current situation. A report by ING suggests that the current tariffs on Chinese products could generate significant tax revenue, but this would drop to zero if China stopped exporting.</p>

            <p>Federal officials were denied entry at two Los Angeles Unified elementary schools this week, marking the first reported instance of such an attempt amid concerns about immigration enforcement. The individuals identified themselves as representatives of a federal agency, later confirmed to be from Homeland Security Investigations, but were denied access following district protocols. The district has reaffirmed its commitment to protecting students from immigration enforcement activity and has trained employees on how to respond to federal immigration authorities.

            <p>China's consumer prices fell in March as the trade war with the U.S. intensified, with the consumer price index (CPI) dropping 0.1% year-on-year. This decline reflects the continued risk of deflation to the Chinese economy, which is likely to be exacerbated by the trade war. Economists anticipate further downward pressure on prices as a result of declining American demand, which will leave Chinese producers with unsold inventory. The Chinese government is expected to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand and mitigate deflationary pressures.</p>
