          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died after being struck by a boat in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, in an incident that nearly capsized the vessel and threw a passenger overboard. Officials from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after being called to the scene. Due to tidal conditions, the whale's carcass will remain on a shallow sandbar until it can be safely towed for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death. Boaters in the area are being advised to use caution.</p>

          <p>In a Fox News opinion piece, commentator David Marcus calls for the Washington NFL team to restore its former "Redskins" name, framing it as a necessary reversal of societal changes from 2020. The author argues that this and the restoration of toppled statues of historical figures would represent a healing from a period of what he terms "mass hysteria." The article posits that society should be able to correct what it sees as mistakes, rather than accepting certain progressive changes as irreversible.</p>

The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system, according to state media footage. The video, aired to mark an anniversary of the People's Liberation Army, showed a control room operator clearing a jet for take-off. This drill marks a significant milestone for the carrier, which is a key component of China's naval modernization efforts and is expected to enter service this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump have renewed questions among some experts about his mental fitness, citing instances of rambling, off-topic remarks, and apparent confabulation. The article points to a recent unprompted two-minute rant about windmills and a factually impossible story about his uncle and the Unabomber as examples. While the White House dismisses these concerns, some psychologists suggest the president's pattern of speech shows a deterioration from his more articulate past, prompting calls for greater scrutiny.</p>

          <p>For couples facing a rocky marriage without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend taking proactive steps to protect personal finances. Key advice includes gaining full transparency into all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, making the process smoother if a divorce occurs. Another option is a postnuptial agreement, which can define how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided, providing security for both parties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests using specific phrases to de-escalate tantrums by connecting with a child rather than trying to control them. Instead of punishments, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" can validate a child's emotions and make them feel safe. This approach, which focuses on co-regulation and setting boundaries with compassion, helps build trust and can reduce the frequency of future meltdowns.</p>

          <p>An expert analysis suggests that recent conflicts in the Middle East, particularly the direct Iran-Israel confrontation, are causing China to shift its regional strategy. While maintaining its economic interests, Beijing is reportedly adopting a more pragmatic stance, recognizing Iran's relative weakness and Israel's strategic and technological importance. This could lead to China playing a more balanced, mediatory role, potentially restraining Iran while strengthening its own global image as a responsible power, a move that could reshape regional geopolitics.
