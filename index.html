          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 22:29:52 EDT</div>

          <p>An investigation into a new federal detention center in Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," reveals that many of its detainees have no criminal records, contradicting administration claims of housing only the "worst of the worst." The facility holds individuals like DACA recipients, who were brought to the U.S. as children and previously protected from deportation. This development raises concerns among immigration advocates about a shift in policy, suggesting that any DACA beneficiary could now be subject to arrest and deportation. The article highlights the case of one such detainee who says ICE officials told him the DACA program was now canceled.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to increase security presence around federal sites like the National Mall as part of a mission to address crime. While officials state the troops will support local law enforcement with logistics and will not be armed, their deployment on U.S. soil is a significant step. The move is part of a broader action that includes the president temporarily taking control of the D.C. police force for 30 days. Critics question the necessity of a military presence in these areas, while the administration insists it is a required action to restore order.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 22:20:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has submitted a surprise $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome, the world's most popular web browser. Perplexity argues that moving Chrome to an independent operator would enhance user safety and choice on the open web. The offer comes as Google faces a significant antitrust case from the U.S. Department of Justice, which could potentially result in a court-ordered sale of the browser. However, analysts are skeptical of the bid's success, noting the offer is likely far below Chrome's actual value and the outcome of the antitrust ruling remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new annual report from the U.S. State Department claims the human rights situation in the United Kingdom has worsened over the last year. The report specifically highlights concerns over restrictions on freedom of expression, citing government responses to protests and online speech it deemed hateful or misinformative. It also points to the implementation of 'buffer zones' around abortion clinics, which prohibit certain protest activities, as a concerning limit on speech. A UK government spokesperson defended its record, stating it proudly upholds freedoms while ensuring citizen safety, balancing free expression with public order.</p>

          <p>Rapper and YouTube personality DDG was briefly detained by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies in what appears to have been a 'swatting' incident. DDG stated that officers surrounded him with weapons drawn at a paintball event following a false report that he was armed and intended to harm himself and others. 'Swatting' involves making a fake emergency call to provoke a large, aggressive law enforcement response to a target's location. After being held for about 20 minutes and explaining the situation, he was released without charges, later recounting the frightening experience on his social media.</p>

Prosecutors sought her arrest over concerns she might destroy evidence, following hours of questioning. The charges relate to incidents including her failure to declare a luxury pendant and allegedly accepting expensive gifts as bribes. Her husband, the former president, also faces a trial for insurrection charges after his ouster from office.</p>

          <p>A recent collision involving Chinese and Philippine vessels near a disputed shoal is expected to heighten tensions in the volatile South China Sea. While China has not officially confirmed the collision, its coastguard stated it took necessary measures to expel the Philippine ship, describing its actions as professional and legal. Security analysts believe the incident will likely prompt Beijing to increase its maritime presence and enhance coordination between its navy and coastguard to project power and prevent similar occurrences. The event underscores the ongoing territorial disputes and the risk of conflict escalation in the strategically vital waterway.</p>

Kaplan mandated that ICE reduce the number of people per room, provide sleeping mats, and ensure the facility is cleaned three times daily.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen has suffered another significant blow with relief pitcher Brock Stewart being placed on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation. Stewart was a key trade deadline acquisition intended to strengthen a relief corps already depleted by numerous injuries. This setback adds to the team's challenges, which also saw starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin undergo season-ending elbow surgery on the same day. While the team is optimistic about Stewart's return before the end of the season, his absence introduces more uncertainty for a pitching staff that has struggled recently.</p>

          <p>Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential path to ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions, though no ceasefire has materialized. The choice of Alaska, once Russian territory, holds historical significance and offers a geographically logical meeting point. This summit is being framed by the White House as a "listening exercise" to gauge Putin's seriousness about peace, but Ukraine has not been invited to participate directly, raising concerns about deals being made without its involvement.</p>

However, cancers of the pancreas, esophagus, stomach, and lungs have seen minimal improvement, with survival rates remaining below 20%.

          <p>Leaders of the European Union have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend Europe's security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The EU is concerned that a deal could be struck over the war in Ukraine without their involvement, especially given Trump's suggestion that Ukraine might have to cede territory. In a joint statement, the leaders emphasized that a just peace must respect international law and Ukraine's sovereignty. The appeal highlights European anxiety over being sidelined in critical negotiations that could reshape the continent's security landscape for years to come.</p>

          <p>As ocean temperatures rise due to climate change, the risk of infection from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, is increasing and spreading to new areas. The bacteria, which thrives in warm coastal waters, can enter the body through small cuts and cause a rapidly spreading infection that is fatal for about one in five people. Cases have recently been reported as far north as Connecticut and New York, regions that previously saw few infections. Experts warn the danger is heightened during hurricane season and can also be contracted by consuming uncooked seafood like oysters.</p>

          <p>Shares of Spirit Airlines fell dramatically after the company expressed "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operating for the next year. The budget carrier, which only recently emerged from bankruptcy, cited persistent adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and rising costs. In its quarterly report, Spirit warned these challenges are expected to continue through 2025. The company is considering further cost-cutting measures, including selling aircraft, as it struggles to find sufficient liquidity to sustain its operations in a competitive market.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who is serving four consecutive life sentences for the murder of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly being tormented by fellow inmates. Despite being held in solitary confinement for his own safety, other prisoners are allegedly yelling taunts at him through the ventilation system connecting their cells. According to a retired homicide detective with prison sources, the relentless harassment occurs at all hours and is reportedly causing Kohberger significant frustration and sleep deprivation. Prison officials are unlikely to intervene as the taunts do not pose a direct physical threat to him in his restricted unit.</p>

          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are experiencing a significant decline in their harvest, with some seeing up to 30% fewer peaches this year. The issue is attributed to warmer winter temperatures, which have disrupted the essential 'sleep cycle' that stone fruit trees require to regulate nutrients and produce a healthy crop. This phenomenon, linked to climate change, is impacting not just peaches but also plums, apricots, and cherries. As a result of the reduced supply, consumers are already seeing higher prices for peaches across the country, highlighting the direct economic impact of changing weather patterns.</p>

While police believe the motive was a property dispute, the victim's family and the Sikh Coalition are questioning why the attack is not being investigated as a potential hate crime.

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to achieve top rankings, specifically questioning why his Grok AI chatbot is not featured more prominently. The threat comes amid Musk's ongoing feud with OpenAI, which he is also suing. Apple responded that its App Store is designed to be fair and that rankings are based on objective criteria, not political bias or anti-competitive practices.</p>

This is the second major transfer of its kind this year, coming as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking. The move demonstrates ongoing collaboration on security issues, with Mexico agreeing to the transfer under the condition that none of the inmates would face the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Residents in parts of Juneau, Alaska, are being urged to evacuate due to an imminent 'glacial outburst' flood from the Mendenhall River. The flooding occurs when an ice dam on a glacial lake collapses from summer heat, releasing massive amounts of water. This phenomenon, exacerbated by climate change, has caused significant damage in recent years, destroying homes and infrastructure. Authorities have installed emergency flood barriers but are advising evacuation as a precaution, with the river expected to crest at or above record levels, highlighting the growing threat of climate-driven disasters in the region.</p>

The move follows several cases where a lack of official information led to widespread speculation and, in one instance, was partly blamed for sparking riots. While the final decision to release such information will remain with individual police forces, the guidance seeks to create a more consistent and transparent approach.</p>

          <p>The UK car industry is at a critical point, with vehicle production in the first half of 2025 hitting its lowest level since 1953. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including factory closures, high energy and labor costs, and the lingering effects of Brexit and the pandemic. This downturn threatens a sector that contributes £22 billion to the economy and has historically been a major source of high-quality jobs. While some new investments in electric vehicle production offer a glimmer of hope, many experts are concerned that too much manufacturing capacity has already been lost.</p>
