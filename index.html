          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and NATO leaders are scheduled for a virtual meeting to align their positions before a high-stakes summit between Trump and Russian President Putin in Alaska. European allies are concerned about being sidelined and are pushing for Ukraine's inclusion in any peace talks, fearing a deal could be made at Kyiv's expense. Zelenskyy has stressed that any negotiations about Ukraine's future must include Ukrainian representatives to be considered legitimate. The discussions aim to present a united front and address fears that Putin might secure favorable concessions without their input.</p>

          <p>Four years after the collapse of property giant China Evergrande Group, millions of Chinese homebuyers are still dealing with the consequences, living in unfinished or substandard apartments. Many who prepaid for their homes found construction frozen, leaving them with significant financial losses and no viable place to live. Some have moved into properties that are mere concrete shells, lacking basic utilities like permanent water and electricity and failing to meet safety standards. The crisis has left a lasting scar on China's housing market and the families caught in the fallout.</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that climate change is creating severe and often overlooked health risks for pregnant women, newborns, and children globally. Extreme heat, air pollution from fossil fuels, and malnutrition due to crop failures are linked to higher rates of preterm births, infant mortality, and maternal health complications. Researchers found that one billion children are already at an "extremely high risk" from these effects, particularly in poorer nations. The article emphasizes that while the problem is enormous, immediate actions like improving public health infrastructure and implementing early warning systems can save lives now.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Parisians and tourists can legally swim in the Seine River this summer. The city has established designated swimming areas, complete with docks and lifeguards, following a major cleanup effort for the recent Olympic Games. Massive new overflow tanks were built to prevent sewage from contaminating the river during heavy rains, finally making the long-promised goal a reality. The opening provides a scenic and historic way for people to cool off during recent heat waves, bringing back scenes reminiscent of old paintings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has tempered expectations for the upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, framing it as a "listening exercise" rather than a forum for a definitive peace deal. This shift comes amid concerns from Ukraine and European allies that Trump might push for a peace agreement involving territorial concessions from Kyiv. President Trump recently mentioned the possibility of "land swapping," a concept that Ukraine's President Zelenskyy has firmly rejected. Analysts suggest the meeting is unlikely to produce a major breakthrough, given the maximalist demands from Moscow and the complexities of the conflict.</p>

The move signals a significant diplomatic fallout, as China had previously lodged serious protests and urged the Czech Republic to maintain stable relations.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to an agreement with Aston Villa to sign 24-year-old midfielder Jacob Ramsey. The two clubs are in advanced talks, and Ramsey is expected to discuss his future with Villa within the next 24 hours before making a final decision. Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe is keen on the transfer, and St James' Park is believed to be Ramsey's preferred destination if he chooses to leave Villa. Ramsey, a former England U21 international, has been a regular player for Aston Villa, scoring 17 goals in 167 appearances since his debut.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, France, and Germany have warned that they are prepared to trigger the "snapback" mechanism to reinstate United Nations sanctions on Iran if it fails to resume diplomatic talks over its nuclear program. The warning comes two months after a conflict where the U.S. and Israel bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. The snapback provision, part of the original 2015 nuclear deal, allows any signatory to reimpose sanctions without a veto. This move increases pressure on Tehran, which has been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels since the U.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018.</p>

          <p>London's status as a premier global financial hub is being tested by a combination of persistent inflation, post-Brexit trade barriers, and increasing competition from other financial centers like New York and Frankfurt. The cost of living has risen sharply, and business uncertainty remains high, hampering investment. Fundraising from IPOs has fallen to a 30-year low, signaling declining confidence in UK equity markets. Despite these challenges, there is potential for recovery through lower interest rates, new trade deals, and government policies focused on boosting growth and attracting entrepreneurial talent.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Angels 7-6 in a dramatic walk-off finish, causing them to fall into a first-place tie with the San Diego Padres in the National League West. A go-ahead ninth-inning home run by Shohei Ohtani seemed to signal a breakthrough for the struggling Dodgers, but the bullpen blew the lead in the bottom of the inning. The Angels secured the victory in the tenth, extending the Dodgers' losing streak and erasing what was once a comfortable nine-game division lead. The team's midseason meltdown has now set the stage for a tight divisional race.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for the state of California are arguing in court that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles was an illegal violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. The state contends that using the military for domestic law enforcement, including setting up roadblocks and detaining civilians, caused anxiety and fear among residents. The Trump administration maintains the deployment was legal under Title 10, which allows the president to use Guard forces during a "rebellion," and was necessary to protect federal property and personnel during protests. The trial's outcome could have significant implications for presidential authority.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the greatest danger from the upcoming Trump-Putin summit is not a bad deal, but Donald Trump adopting Vladimir Putin's false narrative about the Ukraine war. The author suggests Putin will frame the conflict as the fault of a corrupt Ukraine, aiming to manipulate Trump into pressuring Kyiv to capitulate under terms that would ensure its future vulnerability. The piece warns that Trump, driven by a desire to appear as a master dealmaker, may not distinguish between a just peace and a Russian victory. A successful outcome for Putin would involve Trump emerging from the talks echoing Kremlin talking points.</p>

          <p>A study from the National Child Mortality Database reveals that thirteen children under age 11 have died after falling from windows in rented or temporary housing in England since 2019. The report calls these deaths "entirely preventable" and urges landlords to fix faulty windows and install proper locks. In many cases, families had reported broken windows or non-functional safety restrictors. A separate report from the housing watchdog likens the scale of window safety defects to the known problems with damp and mould, highlighting systemic issues in social housing that put children at risk.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that foreign-owned multinational enterprises (MNEs) contributed to 25% of the total carbon emissions from all companies in China between 2002 and 2021. Researchers from institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that these emissions created a geographical imbalance. The economic benefits were concentrated in China's eastern coastal regions, while the heavier environmental burdens were borne by the central and western inland areas. The study highlights that MNEs are a significant but often overlooked factor in analyzing carbon inequality and responsibility.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent announcement of 39% tariffs on Swiss exports has shattered Switzerland's long-held sense of exceptionalism and political isolation. The move has provoked an identity crisis in a country that has prospered by remaining neutral and detached from global politics. The author contends that Switzerland's strategy of being part of the free world without sharing its burdens is no longer viable in an era of aggressive geoeconomics. The tariffs, which are more severe than those on Algeria, have left the Swiss establishment floundering and may force a reconsideration of its relationship with the EU. (not investment advice)</p>
