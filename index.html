          <p>A data breach at a UK Ministry of Defence sub-contractor has exposed the personal data of up to 3,700 Afghans who were resettled in the UK. The compromised information includes names, passport details, and reference numbers for the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) scheme. This incident follows a separate major breach in 2022 and has raised serious concerns among advocacy groups about the safety of these individuals and their families. The government has stated there is no evidence the data has been released publicly but is notifying those potentially affected.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has walked back an order that would have replaced Washington D.C.'s police chief, Pamela Smith, with a federal appointee. Following a lawsuit filed by the city, the Justice Department agreed to a new arrangement where the federal official will act as an intermediary rather than taking direct command of the force. This development resolves a key point of contention in the ongoing dispute over the federalization of the city's police. However, disagreements over federal immigration enforcement in the city are expected to continue in court next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Air Force has issued new guidance that centralizes and standardizes the process for separation boards, which determine if service members who no longer meet military requirements should be discharged. According to an internal memo, the updated rules apply to various cases, including those related to transgender policy changes, and mandate that boards must recommend separation if criteria are met. Supporters of the policy argue it enhances military readiness and ensures consistency in discipline. This move aligns with the Defense Secretary's broader initiative to restore what is termed a "warrior ethos" and enforce stricter standards across the armed forces.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a tangible deal to end the war in Ukraine. Despite Trump describing the meeting as productive, he offered few details and took no questions, leaving allies and observers uncertain about what was discussed. The article suggests Putin achieved a symbolic victory by securing a high-profile meeting on U.S. soil, projecting an image of restored international standing. Ultimately, the summit ended with no clear progress on a ceasefire or peace agreement, leaving the next steps in the conflict ambiguous.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," spent six months meticulously planning his escape from an Arkansas prison. Hardin told investigators he exploited lax security in the prison kitchen to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform, which he used to simply walk out of a gate. The report highlights significant procedural failures, leading to the firing of two employees and raising questions about systemic security issues at the facility. Hardin was recaptured after nearly two weeks, having survived in the woods on smuggled food and foraged items.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin ended with no agreement on a ceasefire in Ukraine, leaving the conflict's future uncertain. While Trump claimed "great progress" was made, the lack of specific details or tangible outcomes has led analysts to view the summit as a disappointment for U.S. diplomatic efforts. For Putin, the event provided a significant international platform, which is seen as a strategic gain regardless of the outcome of the talks. The absence of a deal raises questions about whether the Trump administration will now proceed with threatened sanctions against Russia.</p>

This development comes a year after the city enacted a law to allow such sales, aiming to create a new, more affordable path to homeownership. Officials hope this ADU condominium will serve as a model for other cities in the state, potentially creating a new generation of starter homes. While ADUs now account for a significant portion of new housing growth, their overall impact on the state's severe housing shortage remains a subject of debate.</p>

The suit alleges that Otter's "Otter Notebook" tool, used for services like Zoom and Google Meet, defaults to recording conversations and uses the data to train its AI systems, violating privacy and wiretap laws. This legal challenge highlights growing concerns over the platform's privacy practices, as users have previously reported instances of the tool recording confidential discussions.

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects have focused on the shrinking sea, but this study suggests the pollution originates from a wide variety of sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. Researchers now recommend a shift in strategy, from controlling the sources to protecting people directly through measures like indoor air filtration and public health alerts.

          <p>The global bubble tea market is experiencing explosive growth, projected to be worth nearly $4.8 billion by 2032, with several major Chinese chains recently launching successful IPOs in Hong Kong. The industry's rapid expansion is largely fueled by a franchise model, where parent companies profit from supplying ingredients while individual franchisees bear the operational costs. This has allowed chains like Mixue to open over 46,000 stores globally. However, the industry now faces challenges of market saturation and intense price wars, raising questions about whether its current boom is sustainable long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats in California, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps, a move aimed at countering similar Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas. The plan, which would need voter approval in a special election, could give Democrats up to five additional U.S. House seats by reshaping districts to their advantage. This effort would override the state's independent redistricting commission, which voters established over a decade ago to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The outcome could have significant implications for control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after the Chinese government complained about works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists. The show's curator, a Burmese artist named Sai, alleges that Chinese embassy officials, accompanied by Thai city officials, demanded the removal of sensitive artworks. The gallery ultimately complied, covering artists' names and references to Tibet and Hong Kong with black paint. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression, and the curators have since fled Thailand fearing for their safety.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an affordable, American-made electric pickup truck by focusing on simplicity and customization. The base model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that the company plans to sell for significantly less than the average EV, with owners able to add over 100 different accessories. However, the company's initial sub-$20,000 price point relied on federal tax credits that are being rolled back, raising questions about its competitiveness at a higher price. Slate faces the challenge of convincing consumers to choose its barebones truck over similarly priced conventional models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the Trump administration's federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.

The resolution asserts that the only emergency is a political one created by the administration itself. This legislative action represents a formal challenge to the executive order and aims to restore local control over the city's police force.</p>
