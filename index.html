            <h2>Energy Secretary Advocates for Maintaining Coal Plants to Meet Growing Electricity Demand</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-08 12:32:48 EDT</div>

            <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that keeping coal plants open is crucial to meet the increasing electricity demands driven by AI data centers and other industries. His comments align with President Trump's plan to classify coal as a critical mineral, aiming to expand electricity output by 25%. While Trump suggests coal as a backup for data centers, the tech sector, leading in AI development, is focused on renewables and nuclear energy due to coal's high emissions. Despite a significant decline in coal usage since 2001, PJM Interconnection warns of potential electricity shortages due to planned coal plant retirements. (not investment advice)</p>

He also threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs and warned of additional tariffs on China for retaliatory measures. A White House official suggested a potential total tariff of 104% on Chinese goods, escalating trade tensions and market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Prince Harry is appealing the decision to downgrade his security in the UK, arguing that he was treated unfairly compared to working members of the Royal Family. His legal team claims that the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) did not follow standard procedures and lacked expert risk analysis when downgrading his security after he stepped down as a working royal in 2020. The Home Office, representing Ravec, contends that the security downgrade was justified due to his change of status and relocation abroad, but security is still considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <p>President Trump's plan for reciprocal tariffs, intended to match taxes on U.S. imports with those imposed on American exports, aims to level the playing field but faces structural challenges. Economists warn of potential disruptions to global commerce, increased costs for consumers, and administrative complexities due to varying tariff rates. The White House is considering country-specific tariff rates based on trade imbalances, potentially leading to retaliatory measures. Experts anticipate that these tariffs could raise consumer prices as businesses pass on added costs, particularly for products without readily available substitutes. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Barclays has eliminated gender and ethnicity targets for its US staff, joining other UK companies responding to an anti-diversity trend. Managers will no longer be required to consider how new hires and promotions advance the careers of women and minority ethnic backgrounds. The bank's CEO cited a review of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) approach as the reason for the decision. This move follows President Trump's reversal of DEI policies in the federal government, prompting several large US corporations to scale back their DEI schemes.</p>
