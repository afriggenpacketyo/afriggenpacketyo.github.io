          <p>The federal corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been dismissed with prejudice, meaning he cannot be retried on the same charges.  The Department of Justice's request to drop the case was granted by Judge Dale Ho, who emphasized concerns about the case's potential impact on Adams' ability to govern and cooperate with the Trump administration.  Adams and his attorney have maintained his innocence. The dismissal prevents further political pressure on Adams.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order will close the de minimis trade loophole, ending duty-free entry for shipments under $800, effective May 2.  This decision aims to address concerns about counterfeit goods, unsafe products, and the facilitation of illicit substances.  The closure impacts Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein, which heavily utilize this loophole.  The delay until May 2 provides time for businesses and customs officials to prepare for the changes.</p>
