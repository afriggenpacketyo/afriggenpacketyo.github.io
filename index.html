        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after convicting him of orchestrating a military coup plot. The ruling found him guilty of leading a conspiracy to unlawfully remain in power following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict has drawn reactions from U.S. political figures, with former President Trump calling it surprising and Secretary of State Marco Rubio labeling it a "witch hunt." Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, has consistently denied the charges against him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the collapse of Spirit Airlines, stating that the business model for discount carriers is no longer viable. Following Spirit's second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, Kirby asserted that the model, which relies on low fares and numerous additional fees, alienates customers and is unsustainable amid high costs and shifting demand. While Spirit and rival Frontier have attempted to adapt by offering bundled services, Kirby remains skeptical, equating their efforts to being the "last man on a sinking ship." Spirit has responded by suggesting Kirby's focus on them indicates their own competitive appeal.</p>

Prior to the game, he met with the team in their clubhouse and delivered a speech, an event that manager Aaron Boone described as an honor. This was Trump's first appearance at a Major League Baseball game since the 2021 World Series. The event featured heightened security, particularly in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, with Secret Service and sniffer dogs present throughout Yankee Stadium to ensure safety.</p>

The girl was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Johnson was initially arrested on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter and child neglect, but the charges were escalated to murder on Thursday. He is currently in custody with bail set at $200,000, and an investigation into the circumstances of the death is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Trump in Florida, forfeited his right to an opening statement after he began making irrelevant remarks in court. Representing himself, Routh's speech veered into topics such as Adolf Hitler and global conflicts, prompting Judge Aileen Cannon to cut him off. Prosecutors allege Routh meticulously planned the September 2024 attack at Trump's golf club, driven by a desire to prevent his reelection. The trial features testimony from Secret Service agents and a witness who followed Routh's vehicle after the incident, which occurred just weeks after a separate assassination attempt on Trump.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the U.S. political spectrum. President Trump, who was close to Kirk, ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and blamed "radical left" rhetoric for the violence. Former presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton also denounced the killing, calling for civility and an end to political violence. The event sparked a tense moment on the House floor during an attempted moment of silence.

Gulf leaders, including those from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have condemned the strike as a violation of sovereignty, viewing it as evidence that U.S. protection is unreliable.

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the political response to Charlie Kirk's assassination, arguing that President Trump and other conservatives are inaccurately framing political violence as a uniquely left-wing problem. The author contends that while the shooter's motive is unknown, the immediate rush to blame the left ignores data showing that far-right extremists have perpetrated the majority of domestic terror attacks in recent decades. The piece highlights Trump's own history of rhetoric that encourages or excuses violence, such as his defense of the January 6th Capitol rioters. It concludes that this one-sided narrative creates a dangerous environment detached from factual reality.</p>

He was a key ally to President Trump, using a relatable, conversational style to advocate for increasingly conservative social stances.

          <p>With recent inflation data creating economic uncertainty, savers may consider the safety of a traditional savings account for a sum like $10,000. However, with the average interest rate at just 0.39%, the annual earnings on such a deposit would be less than $40, failing to keep pace with the current 2.9% inflation rate. The article suggests that this effectively results in a loss of purchasing power over time. As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates, the returns from traditional savings are likely to diminish even further, making alternatives like high-yield savings accounts more attractive.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has abruptly withdrawn a state bill aimed at overhauling Measure ULA, the city's voter-approved tax on high-value property sales. The proposed legislation would have reduced the tax burden on the sale of newly constructed commercial and apartment buildings to address concerns that the original measure slowed housing production. The bill was pulled just before its first committee vote due to the need for further amendments, with plans to reintroduce it in January. The move was praised by supporters of the original Measure ULA, who had argued against giving tax breaks to developers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is urging a federal appeals court to quickly overturn a ruling that prevents President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The administration wants a decision before the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting next week, where a key interest rate decision will be made. Trump sought to remove Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of mortgage fraud, but a lower court found he lacked legally permissible cause. The Justice Department argues the president has broad discretion in removing federal officials, highlighting the ongoing tension between the White House and the central bank.</p>

The suspect is believed to have arrived on campus around 11:52 a.m. MT, shortly before the event was scheduled to begin. At approximately 12:23 p.m. MT, Kirk was struck by a single shot, which officials believe was fired from the roof of the nearby Losee Center building. Dispatch audio from minutes after the shooting described a person in black tactical gear carrying a long rifle on the roof, who then fled into a nearby neighborhood.</p>

          <p>The latest consumer price index report shows U.S. inflation rose to 2.9% in August, adding a layer of uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates. In this economic climate, the article suggests that investing in gold can be a prudent strategy. Gold historically maintains its value and often appreciates during inflationary periods, acting as a hedge that protects a portfolio's purchasing power when the value of the dollar erodes. While gold prices are currently high, further delays in investing could make it more prohibitive if inflationary trends continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship that he believes ultimately helped his score. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball was apparently stolen by two spectators. When play resumed, the missing ball allowed him to take a penalty drop instead of playing a more difficult provisional ball. Fitzpatrick suggested this saved him at least one stroke, contributing to his six-under-par 66 score. He finished the day two strokes behind the leaders.</p>

The DOJ accuses the company of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to modify its policies to prevent such discrimination.

Unlike past coup plotters in Brazil who received amnesty, Bolsonaro faces a 27-year prison sentence, sending a strong message that undermining democratic institutions will not be tolerated. While the verdict is seen by critics as a necessary step for accountability, it is likely to deepen the political divisions within the nation.</p>
