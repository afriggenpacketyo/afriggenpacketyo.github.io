          <p>An Air India Boeing Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London, resulting in the presumed deaths of hundreds of passengers and crew, as well as possible fatalities on the ground. Initial data indicates the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 625 feet before descending rapidly, and the cause of the crash remains unknown, prompting an investigation involving international protocols. Air India's CEO expressed condolences and focused on supporting those affected, while Boeing and GE Aerospace offered assistance, and flights at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport were temporarily suspended. The aircraft had accumulated 41,000 flight hours and nearly 8,000 takeoffs, which is average for its age. The rescue teams have been mobilized to provide medical aid and relief support to the crash site.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee convened a hearing featuring Democratic governors JB Pritzker of Illinois, Tim Walz of Minnesota, and Kathy Hochul of New York to discuss their states' immigration policies. Republicans on the committee have labeled these policies as "sanctuary" measures that obstruct federal immigration enforcement, while the governors prepared to defend their records, highlighting cooperation with federal authorities. The hearing occurs amidst heightened tensions surrounding immigration, particularly in California, where protests prompted federal intervention. The Democratic Governors Association dismissed the hearing as a political stunt, asserting that their leaders are focused on governing and ensuring public safety.</p>

Executives from companies like Unicredit and Goldman Sachs have told CNBC that Europe has a significant opportunity to attract capital inflows, as evidenced by recent data showing increased investment in European stocks. Private equity firms like Carlyle Group and Permira also see greater potential returns in Europe due to cheaper capital and lower valuations. While trade tensions remain a concern, particularly regarding a potential EU-U.S. trade deal, European leaders express optimism about finding solutions, and the future of Europe's economic revival lies in its own hands.</p>

          <p>Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are calling for an investigation into Ed Martin, a top Justice Department official, regarding his stated intentions to "shame" political opponents of President Trump who he cannot criminally charge. The Democrats' letter expresses grave concern about Martin's planned abuse of his roles as head of the "Weaponization Working Group" and as DOJ's Pardon Attorney, citing his controversial tenure as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Martin has publicly pledged to target the alleged "weaponization" of the department under the Biden administration and suggested publicly shaming officials he cannot charge, conflicting with DOJ policy.

          <p>House Republicans are preparing for a rare vote to claw back $9.1 billion from already appropriated spending, targeting USAID, NPR, and PBS. This move represents the first time in three decades that lawmakers will vote to cancel previously allocated funds, based on recommendations from DOGE, an organization that identifies waste, fraud, and abuse. The vote is expected to be tight, and its failure would be an embarrassment for House Republicans, who have historically emphasized reining in federal spending. The outcome of the vote will demonstrate the GOP's ability to implement even modest spending cuts, reflecting their commitment to addressing the national debt and deficits.</p>

          <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, has announced that it will impose fines starting at â‚¬500 on passengers whose disruptive behavior leads to their removal from a flight. The airline hopes that the fine will serve as a deterrent to eliminate unacceptable behavior onboard aircraft, as such disruptions are caused by a tiny number of unruly passengers. In addition to the fine, Ryanair will continue to seek civil damages for compensation for the costs incurred in more serious cases. The airline has amended its terms and conditions to allow fines to be taken directly from the card used to make the booking.</p>

China will instead send Premier Li Qiang to represent the country at the event in New York, according to diplomatic sources. The bilateral relationship appears to have improved following a phone call between Xi and Trump on June 5, during which Trump said he had received and reciprocated an invitation to visit China.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to Iran to accept restrictions on its nuclear program faces a ticking clock, with Israel potentially considering military strikes. The proposal aims to prevent Iran from developing domestic enrichment of nuclear fuel, requiring them to procure it from outside the country. Russia has been suggested as a potential source for nuclear fuel purchase or storage of enriched uranium produced by Iran. The IAEA stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations, and the U.S. intelligence assesses that Iran is currently a threshold nuclear state, capable of pursuing a weaponization program relatively quickly.</p>

ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices, while mutual funds are priced at the end of the market day. Both can track benchmark indices or mimic specific sectors, but ETFs generally have lower expense ratios and no minimum investment thresholds. Investors should review a fund's prospectus to understand its objectives, risks, fees, and performance history. (not investment advice)</p>
