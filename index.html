          <h2>American Airlines Lowers 2025 Profit Outlook Amid Consumer Weakness and Operational Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:01:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines has reduced its 2025 profit forecast, citing a challenging July marked by domestic consumer weakness and operational disruptions from storms. The carrier's third-quarter profit projection also fell short of analyst expectations, causing its shares to decline. While international travel remains strong, the airline is scaling back capacity growth in response to a softer domestic market. CEO Robert Isom noted that corporate travel demand has remained flat, contributing to the revised, more cautious financial outlook.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has disclosed it is under a criminal and civil investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning its Medicare billing practices. The company's stock fell following the announcement, which adds to a series of recent challenges, including a major cyberattack and rising medical costs. UnitedHealth stated it has full confidence in its practices and is cooperating with the DOJ, while also initiating a third-party review of its business policies. The investigation scrutinizes whether the company inflated diagnoses to receive higher payments from the Medicare Advantage program.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's life sentence, police released documents revealing unusual incidents at the victims' home before the November 2022 murders. One victim reported seeing an unknown man staring at her, and the roommates once found their front door mysteriously open. The documents detail the extensive investigation, including following up on numerous public tips and using DNA from a knife sheath to identify Kohberger. While the motive remains unknown, the files illustrate the complex police work that led to his conviction for the murders of four University of Idaho students.</p>

          <p>Both Russia and Ukraine have launched deadly drone strikes against each other, resulting in casualties on both sides, just hours after a third round of ceasefire talks in Istanbul ended without progress. In Ukraine, a strike in the Kharkiv region killed three people, while attacks were also reported in Odesa and other cities. Russian officials reported two deaths from a Ukrainian drone attack in Sochi. The brief negotiations failed to produce any tangible steps toward ending the war, with both nations accusing the other of rejecting their proposals.</p>

          <p>The Irish-speaking rap group Kneecap has been banned from Hungary for three years, with a government official citing national security concerns. The Hungarian government accused the band of engaging in "anti-Semitic hate speech supporting terrorism," a claim the band has previously denied. The trio, known for their provocative lyrics and pro-Palestinian stance, was scheduled to perform at a festival in Budapest. This ban is the latest in a series of controversies for the group, which has also faced police investigations and canceled gigs in the UK.</p>

          <h2>Strategist Suggests Investors are Currently Tolerating Tariffs but Should Expect Volatility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial market shocks from new U.S. tariffs, investors appear to have grown comfortable with the prospect of higher import taxes for now, allowing markets to rebound. However, strategists warn that significant volatility should still be expected as the trade situation evolves. The market's resilience is partly attributed to beliefs that U.S. firms can manage the costs and that further negotiations will lead to rollbacks. While underlying economic fundamentals like corporate earnings appear strong, the uncertainty around trade policy remains a key risk for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's Industrial Innovation Fund is backing Cambridge Terahertz, a startup that has developed a 3D imaging system capable of seeing inside unopened packages. The technology aims to tackle the growing problem of return fraud, where customers return empty or incorrect items for a refund, a scam that cost retailers over $100 billion last year. Cambridge Terahertz's system could allow companies like Amazon to quickly verify the contents of returned packages without opening them. The investment aligns with Amazon's goal of finding innovative solutions for its complex logistics network.</p>

          <p>The White House has imposed a 17 percent tariff on tomatoes imported from Mexico, a move that is expected to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. Most of the fresh tomatoes available in American supermarkets year-round, especially smaller varieties, are grown in Mexico. The tariffs are intended to protect American tomato growers, primarily in Florida, but economists argue that U.S. production cannot meet year-round demand at current prices. While consumers will likely bear the brunt of the cost increase, the immediate impact on grocery bills may be moderate.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a major free trade agreement, hailed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as the most significant deal for Britain since Brexit. The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports like textiles and jewellery to the UK. The deal, which took three years to negotiate, also includes a new plan to address illegal migration. The UK government projects the agreement will boost its economy by £4.8 billion annually and create thousands of jobs.</p>

          <p>According to new estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), approximately one in eight women in England and Wales were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking in the past year. The data, from the Crime Survey for the year ending March 2025, found that 12.8% of women experienced one of these crimes, compared to 8.4% of men. This is the first time the ONS has provided a combined prevalence estimate for these offenses, as part of a government initiative to monitor progress on tackling violence against women and girls.</p>

In response to the escalating violence, Thailand has closed its border crossings and recalled its ambassador.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the changing nature of summer camp, suggesting that the modern experience is different from that of previous generations, partly due to the influence of millennial parents. There has been a shift towards shorter, more specialized camps focusing on skills like coding, rather than traditional, full-summer general activity camps. This trend offers flexibility but may also make it harder for children to form deep friendships and can turn camp into an extension of school-year pressures. The piece reflects on whether camp has always been more about fulfilling adult anxieties than ensuring children's fun.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies what the "Epstein files" are, explaining that they comprise a vast collection of documents from multiple criminal and civil investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. While some materials, including flight logs and redacted contact books, have been released, pressure continues on the Trump administration to declassify more. The Department of Justice has stated that no incriminating "client list" was found, but the case's complexities and Epstein's death have fueled widespread speculation. The report notes that many high-profile names appear in existing documents, though this does not imply wrongdoing.</p>
