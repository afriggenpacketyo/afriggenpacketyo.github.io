          <p>President Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and invest billions across several states. He emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, promising more jobs and a $5,000 bonus for each U.S. steelworker, while also guaranteeing no layoffs or outsourcing for at least 10 years. Trump portrayed himself as a skilled dealmaker, claiming he rejected previous offers from Nippon until realizing their commitment to investing in America, stating that U.S. Steel would remain "controlled by the USA," though specifics on ownership structure were not provided. During the 2024 campaign, Trump had pledged to block the acquisition of U.S. Steel by a foreign company. Optimism hinges on the actual implementation and the details of the deal's structure, as well as the future economic impacts. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced the U.S. will double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, aiming to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, he stated this move would ensure U.S. Steel's survival, promising no layoffs and a $5,000 bonus for U.S. steelworkers. Trump reflected on implementing 25% steel tariffs during his first term, touting the increase as a way to ensure U.S. Steel's survival, as the announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs. While campaigning for president, Trump had said he would block foreign acquisition of US Steel, and it's unclear how the reported partnership would operate and who would own the company.

          <p>President Trump downplayed rumors of a rift with Elon Musk during Musk's official last day as a "special government employee," praising him as a great business leader. Trump indicated that Musk would continue to be involved, stating that many of his DOGE team members would remain in the administration, and Musk declared he would continue to visit the White House as an advisor. Musk attended the press conference with a visible black eye, attributing it to a playful punch from his son, X Ã† A-12, while Trump offered marital advice to French President Macron regarding a video of Macron and his wife. The article suggests a positive, if somewhat unconventional, departure for Musk from his government role.</p>

Trump praised Rudolph as a potential franchise quarterback, complimenting Killebrew as a "killer." Trump has become popular among professional athletes throughout his second term and dating back to his campaign, especially among football players, and Trump's signature dance became a frequent touchdown celebration during the 2024 NFL season.

          <p>UCLA's baseball team crushed Fresno State with a 19-4 victory in their NCAA regional opener, marking their first regional appearance since 2019. The Bruins recorded a season-high 22 hits, led by Mulivai Levu's five RBIs, while Roman Martin and Blake Balsz also contributed significantly to the offensive onslaught. Pitcher Chris Grothues secured the win after relieving starter Michael Barnett, who struggled with command, and Roch Cholowsky, despite not leading the charge, still managed two hits. The Bruins advance to the winnerâ€™s bracket and will face the winner of UC Irvine and Arizona State.

          <p>North and South Korea are engaged in an ongoing information war, with the South attempting to introduce outside information to the North, while Kim Jong Un's regime tries to block it. South Korea uses loudspeakers along the border to broadcast pop songs and subversive messages, while USB sticks loaded with foreign films, TV dramas, and news are smuggled into North Korea. However, North Korea is cracking down on those caught with foreign content, and funding for these efforts has been hit by aid cuts, potentially giving North Korea the upper hand. Despite the risks, recent defectors suggest that foreign content has motivated them to escape, influencing their views and lifestyles.

          <p>Dodgers reliever Evan Phillips is scheduled to undergo Tommy John surgery, ending his season prematurely due to ongoing forearm discomfort. Phillips had recently returned from the injured list after recovering from a partially torn rotator cuff he suffered last year, and shortstop Mookie Betts was also out of the lineup due to a toe injury. The news is a setback for the Dodgers, as Phillips was an important part of their bullpen, and Betts' injury adds to the team's challenges. The team will need to adjust their strategy to compensate for these losses, and the success of the season is still in question.</p>

An NIH official rebuked the claim that current HIV prevention strategies mean a vaccine is no longer needed, asserting that a vaccine is the only way to end the HIV epidemic.

          <p>An opinion piece explores a potential link between therapy culture and the increasing rate of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has led to nearly impossible standards for parenting. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, citing emotional or relational struggles, and the author argues this contributes to a dread of parenthood. The piece posits that fear of not meeting these high standards may be a contributing factor in the decision to forgo having children. The piece provides a nuanced perspective on the complex factors influencing decisions about parenthood.</p>

The agreement ends a legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be a descendant of two people in the photos, which were taken in 1850. The photos were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz as part of discredited research to prove white superiority, and the case sparked debate about universities' historical links to slavery. Harvard said it had always hoped the photos would be given to another museum, and Ms. Lanier expressed her joy with the outcome. The transfer of the images marks a significant step in addressing the legacy of slavery and promoting access to these important historical artifacts.</p>

They call the prosecution an "egregious overreach by the executive branch" that threatens public trust in the judicial system. Dugan pleaded not guilty, and the case raises concerns about the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. The outcome of the case will likely have implications for judicial independence and the balance of power between branches of government.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he was doubling foreign tariffs on steel imports to 50% and celebrated a "blockbuster" agreement for Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel during a rally in Pennsylvania. He declared the tariff hike would further secure the steel industry, gloating that the Nippon investment would make the American steelmaker "synonymous with greatness". Trump asserted that the agreement ensured US Steel would remain under American control, framing the drive to boost domestic steel production as a matter of national security. He blamed "decades of Washington betrayals" for hollowing out the American steel industry, and repeated false claims about the 2020 election. The success of these measures depends on global economic conditions and trade relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stating his work "has been without comparison in modern history". While Musk's cost-cutting efforts fell short of the promised $1 trillion, Trump indicated Musk would remain involved, as Trump praised a federal appeals court decision reinstating his tariffs. Musk defended DOGE's work and said he expects to achieve the $1 trillion goal "over time", and Musk said he would continue visiting the White House and serve as a "friend and adviser" to the president. Musk has publicly split from Trump over his domestic policy package, raising questions about their long-term alignment.

          <p>The Army is circulating guidelines for expelling transgender troops from the military, instructing personnel to address transgender troops according to their medical assignment at birth. The guidelines outline criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria, including past requests for grooming standard exemptions or "overt conduct" of gender identity differing from assigned sex at birth. Transgender soldiers will be separated under the Secretarial Plenary Authority, and Army military officers will receive a "Code JDK" upon separation. The policy is being criticized as worse than the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, and it is likely to face legal challenges.

Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs, or use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations. Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The situation creates uncertainty for businesses and consumers.</p>
