          <p>A rockslide in Banff National Park, north of Lake Louise, resulted in the deaths of two hikers and serious injuries to three others, prompting a response from approximately 100 personnel. The six-mile hiking trail along Bow Lake, popular among tourists and families, has limited cellular service, and the area around Bow Glacier Falls is closed until further notice. One of the victims was identified as retired educator Jutta Hinrichs from the University of Alberta, while a trail guide described witnessing the mountainside collapse, comparing it to scenes from 9/11. Park officials advise awareness of surroundings and carrying satellite communication devices in mountain areas due to inherent risks.</p>

          <p>A hot air balloon accident in Praia Grande, Brazil, resulted in the deaths of at least eight people and injuries to thirteen others. According to the pilot, a fire started inside the balloon's basket, prompting him to attempt a landing and instruct passengers to jump; some were unable to escape before the balloon ascended again and subsequently crashed due to loss of suspension. State Governor Jorginho Mello has ordered a task force to the scene, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has offered federal government support to the victims' families. Praia Grande is a popular tourist destination known for its ballooning activities.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, dubbed "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe, marking the 48th blood group system recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The discovery was made after researchers analyzed a blood sample from the patient, revealing a unique antibody and a genetic mutation. The woman, now 54 and living in Paris, is believed to be the only known carrier of this blood type, making her compatible only with herself. Scientists hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

The Fed maintained its benchmark lending rate, considering mixed economic data and uncertainty around tariff impacts. The central bank's decision reflects a cautious approach, balancing concerns about inflation and the labor market.</p>

A witness reported seeing the pilot raise the right wheel, after which the plane's wings rocked, and it took off again before crashing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lemon water, a popular trend on social media, is often touted for its supposed detoxifying and weight-loss benefits; however, experts debunk these claims, emphasizing that the liver and kidneys naturally detoxify the body. While lemon water does not burn fat or boost metabolism, it can contribute to hydration and may replace sugary drinks, indirectly aiding in calorie reduction. Although lemons contain vitamin C, relying solely on lemon water is not a sufficient source, and its acidity can potentially weaken tooth enamel. Consuming lemon water as a morning ritual can be a healthy habit if it encourages greater water intake.</p>

While other advisors favored military action, Bannon's influence reflected the "America First," noninterventionist stance of the MAGA movement.

          <p>As a heatwave approaches the US, experts are highlighting that American sunscreens may be less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. This is attributed to regulatory differences, with the FDA not approving new UV-filtering ingredients in over 20 years. Countries like Europe and South Korea have approved a wider range of ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations in the US, but dermatologists still stress the importance of wearing sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>
