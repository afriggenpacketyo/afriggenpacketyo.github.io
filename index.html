          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen have reportedly shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in recent weeks, costing the Pentagon over $200 million. Defense officials indicate the militants' targeting capabilities have improved, with three drones downed in the past week alone. The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis since mid-March, aiming to halt their attacks on shipping, resulting in hundreds of Houthi casualties. U.S. senators are raising concerns about civilian casualties caused by American strikes in Yemen, questioning the Trump administration's efforts to mitigate civilian harm. </p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers are working to halt the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliation to a terrorism prison in El Salvador. Judges have criticized the White House's use of the statute, with one federal judge stating that "Cows have better treatment now under the law." The ACLU has filed a lawsuit seeking due process for approximately 140 Venezuelan men already deported to El Salvador under the act.

          <p>China has reportedly waived its retaliatory 125% tariffs on certain semiconductor imports from the U.S., signaling a potential thaw in the trade war. According to industry sources, at least eight integrated circuit (IC)-related tariff codes were exempted from levies imposed earlier this month in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. China's customs authorities also informed domestic companies that any duties paid for these exempted semiconductor imports from April 10 to 24 would be eligible for refunds. China has maintained tariffs on memory chips however, as the trade relations between the US and China are still strained.</p>

          <p>A government survey in Japan reveals that 35% of local government officials have experienced overbearing or abusive behavior from residents, significantly higher than the 10.8% reported in a private-sector study. The survey suggests that public officials regularly face unreasonable requests from taxpayers, highlighting the challenges of providing administrative services to everyone. The government has submitted an amendment bill requiring companies and municipalities to take steps to address customer harassment. While the traditional view of customers as "gods" persists, attitudes are slowly shifting towards protecting service workers from abuse.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan migrants subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act are given approximately 12 hours to decide whether to contest their removal, a timeframe deemed insufficient by lawyers. The government argues that this complies with a Supreme Court decision requiring a "reasonable" time to appeal. Under the act, the government has been deporting Venezuelans accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador's CECOT prison. The ACLU contends that the limited time period violates the Supreme Court order and challenges the government's invocation of the act.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has indicated that Ukraine may need to cede territory as part of a peace agreement with Russia, amid growing pressure from President Donald Trump. Klitschko stated that while it is not fair, giving up territory could be a temporary solution for peace, but emphasized that the Ukrainian people would never accept Russian occupation. His comments follow a devastating Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv, one of the deadliest in months. Klitschko's statement is one of the most senior indications from a Ukrainian politician that territorial concessions might be necessary.</p>

The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu left the Post Office unable to build a replacement due to ownership of the computer code. The Post Office prosecuted approximately 700 sub-postmasters for theft and false accounting based on faulty data from the Horizon system, leading to one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.

A Ministry of Commerce taskforce is collecting lists of items that could be eligible for exemptions, with a list of 131 categories of products circulating among businesses. The exemptions suggest that Beijing is worried about the economic impact of decoupling from the U.S. economy. The Chinese government is pushing tariff-hit exporters to focus on local markets, but exemptions offer a larger gesture of support and reduce pressure on the White House.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions, China is sharing rare Moon rocks with US researchers, allowing scientists from six countries, including the US, to examine the samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission in 2020. Two Nasa-funded US institutions have been granted access to the lunar samples, despite restrictions imposed by US lawmakers on space agency collaboration with China. CNSA chief Shan Zhongde emphasized that the samples are "a shared treasure for all humanity." The Chang'e-5 Moon samples are particularly valuable because they appear to be a billion years younger than those collected from Apollo missions.</p>
