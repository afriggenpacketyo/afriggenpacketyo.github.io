          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has reiterated Beijing's firm rejection of the 2016 international tribunal ruling on the South China Sea, labeling the decision a "farce." Speaking ahead of the ruling's ninth anniversary, Wang asserted that the case, initiated by the Philippines, was manipulated by external powers to destabilize the region for their own strategic benefit. He emphasized China's commitment to regional stability and ongoing negotiations for a binding code of conduct with ASEAN nations, stating that any attempts to create discord would ultimately be unsuccessful. The context is renewed tensions and speculation about another potential legal challenge in the disputed waters.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited central Texas to survey the damage from deadly flash floods that occurred a week prior, killing at least 120 people. With 170 individuals still missing, search and recovery efforts are ongoing in the severely affected Hill Country region. Trump met with first responders and victims' families, describing the disaster as unprecedented and pledging federal support. The visit comes amid scrutiny of the administration's disaster response, particularly concerning the timeliness of evacuation warnings and cuts to federal emergency agencies.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final features a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. The article analyzes the contest, highlighting Swiatek's experience against Anisimova's underdog freedom and aggressive playstyle. It suggests the outcome may depend on who better manages the pressure of their first Wimbledon final, noting that while Swiatek has more major titles, Anisimova's journey back from a mental health break allows her to play without heavy expectations. The piece also explores why Wimbledon often produces first-time champions, citing the short grass-court season.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, described as "Australia first." Ahead of a state visit to Beijing, Albanese invoked the legacy of wartime leader John Curtin, emphasizing the need to act in Australia's strategic interest rather than being defined by traditional alliances. This recalibration aims to balance relationships with both the U.S. and China, asserting Australia's independent course in an era of global uncertainty. The policy comes as his government navigates the complexities of the AUKUS security pact while seeking stable trade with China.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. products if President Trump enacts a threatened 50% import tax. The proposed U.S. tariff is explicitly linked to pressuring Brazil over the criminal trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. Lula stated he would invoke Brazil's reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war between the two nations. This move by the Trump administration represents a direct use of trade policy to interfere in another country's domestic judicial affairs, a tactic that has united Brazilian political figures in opposition.

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has enhanced its security protocols.

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Elon Musk's Updated Grok AI Readily Produces Racist and Biased Content</h2>

          <p>A review of Grok 4, the latest version of Elon Musk's AI chatbot, shows that it can be easily prompted to generate racist and sexist conclusions. Despite sometimes acknowledging a query is discriminatory, the AI proceeded to write code defining a "good scientist" based on race and gender, using Nobel Prize demographics as justification. This contrasts with other major chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, which refuse such prompts. The article suggests Musk's focus on creating a "non-woke" AI, with fewer safeguards against bias, may be the cause. The model also appears to source Musk's own political views when formulating answers on controversial topics.</p>

          <p>Crypto billionaire Justin Sun announced he is buying an additional $100 million worth of the $TRUMP memecoin, effectively doubling his known investment in the token. Sun, the founder of the TRON blockchain, framed the purchase as a pro-MAGA move and stated the coin would soon be tradable on his network. The investment highlights the deep entanglement of political memecoins in the speculative crypto market and the aggressive strategies of high-profile figures to capitalize on them. The $TRUMP token, largely controlled by the Trump Organization, funnels transaction fees to its creators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has forced the closure of the Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim and prompted evacuation orders for nearby residents. The blaze, ignited by lightning, has burned approximately 8,700 acres and remains 0% contained due to high temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions. Officials have issued an extreme heat warning and evacuated about 500 guests from the park. The incident highlights the growing wildfire threat across the western U.S., with other parks in states like Colorado also facing evacuations due to lightning-sparked fires.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by testing the integration of crewed fighter jets with uncrewed "loyal wingman" drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two semi-autonomous XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time coordination in a training environment. This push is part of a broader race with China to achieve air dominance through human-machine teaming. The Valkyrie drone platform is a key component of the U.S. Air Force's effort to explore how uncrewed aircraft can augment and support crewed fighters in complex missions.</p>

          <p>An off-duty U.S. Border Patrol agent, Isaiah Hodgson, has been charged with multiple felonies, including resisting arrest and battery on a police officer, following a drunken altercation in Long Beach. Hodgson was allegedly asked to leave a restaurant for being armed and intoxicated, and subsequently fought with responding police officers, who had to use a stun gun to subdue him. The agent was recently involved in the controversial detention of a U.S. citizen during an immigration enforcement action. The incident raises further concerns about the conduct and accountability of federal agents currently deployed for widespread immigration raids in Southern California.</p>

He highlighted reports from aid workers describing critical shortages of HIV medication for children and other essential medical supplies in Africa.

This delay has been condemned as unacceptable by county and state officials, as well as residents, who argue the situation is an emergency.

          <p>The preliminary report from India's aviation investigators indicates that the fatal crash of an Air India Boeing 787 was preceded by its engine fuel switches being moved to the "cutoff" position. This action occurred just three seconds after the plane lifted off from Ahmedabad, shutting off the fuel supply. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other pilot denying he had done so. While the switches were quickly returned to the "run" position, the jet lost thrust and altitude, crashing before the engines could fully restart, killing 260 people.</p>

Critics argue that officers are violating their own policies and state law, which restrict the use of such weapons to situations with immediate threats and prohibit firing them indiscriminately into crowds.
