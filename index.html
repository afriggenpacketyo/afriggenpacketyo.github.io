          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be challenging, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to earn higher returns. Current CD rates are higher than the inflation rate, allowing individuals to lock in high rates for the CD's term while benefiting from FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. Online banks often offer the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs, such as those with six-month to one-year terms, currently provide higher interest rates than longer-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve.</p>

          <p>Current mortgage rates remain elevated, with 15-year mortgages averaging 6.01% and 30-year mortgages at 6.76%, while refinance rates are similarly high. Securing a good rate requires a strong credit score and careful comparison of lenders, as well as considering the loan term and associated fees. Experts suggest that if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, mortgage rates may stabilize, offering some relief to borrowers. Improving credit profiles and shopping around for the best terms remain crucial for those seeking to buy a new home or refinance their existing mortgage. (not investment advice)</p>

Apple plans to appeal the fine, arguing that the EU is unfairly targeting the company and forcing it to give away its technology for free.

The survey found that a large majority of respondents have been impacted by the latest round of tariff increases, with the automotive sector particularly affected. Companies are considering localization efforts in China to mitigate the challenges, but these may not fully offset long-term issues. The trade conflict is causing concern and uncertainty among German businesses operating in China.</p>

          <p>YouTube is celebrating its 20th anniversary, marking two decades since the first video was uploaded, and is on track to become the largest media company by revenue in 2025, surpassing Disney. Analysts estimate YouTube's value between $475 billion and $550 billion, driven by its massive user base and the success of its Premium, Music, and YouTube TV subscription offerings. The platform benefits from its creator community and its integration within Google's ecosystem, leveraging contextual data for targeted advertising. YouTube's growth is a key pillar of Google's business, particularly as its core search function faces new competition from AI chatbots.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that U.S. tariffs will contribute to a slight decrease in the country's fiscal deficit in 2025, despite worsening growth and inflation outlooks due to intensifying trade tensions. The Fiscal Monitor report forecasts the U.S.'s overall federal deficit will fall to 6.5% of gross domestic product this year, down from 7.3% in 2024, contingent on higher tariff revenues. The IMF acknowledges uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the tariff revenue increase and potential impacts on imports and economic activity.</p>

          <p>The European Union is preparing a proposal to impose export restrictions on all eel species under an international agreement regulating trade in endangered species. If approved, this could affect supplies to Japan, which relies heavily on eel imports. The proposal aims to list all 19 eel species and subspecies in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Japan's Fisheries Agency is lobbying against the proposal, but the EU is likely to decide on whether to submit it by early June.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich faces increasing pressure to address its sponsorship deal with Rwanda, with critics citing the country's alleged support for the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers poses a risk to economic growth. Experts warn that garnishing wages from these borrowers could reduce consumer spending and contribute to an economic slowdown. Approximately 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections starting on May 5, adding to the economic pressure. Consumer spending, which accounts for a significant portion of U.S. economic activity, could be negatively impacted by these debt collections, potentially damaging borrowers' credit scores.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price rose for a third consecutive day, driven by a broad relief rally following President Donald Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and his rhetoric towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The price of Bitcoin reached as high as $94,499.86, the highest level since March 3, and is now hovering near the flat line for the year. Market analysts attribute the surge to investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset that is seen as a compelling option for portfolio diversification and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.
