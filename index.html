The commemorations include a military procession from Whitehall to Buckingham Palace, featuring over 1,300 armed forces personnel and members of the public, alongside a flypast by the Red Arrows and historic military aircraft. King Charles and Queen Camilla are expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony and host a tea party for war veterans, while communities across the country will hold street parties and gatherings to echo the celebrations of 1945, with pubs extending their hours for the occasion. The Tower of London will also unveil an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, and various musical performances and museum exhibitions will honor the occasion, reflecting on the personal stories and the nation's understanding of the war today.</p>

          <p>Israel has approved a plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip, expanding its military operations in the Palestinian territory and potentially facing international opposition. The plan involves the call-up of tens of thousands of reserve troops and aims to root out Hamas control, prevent the group from distributing humanitarian aid, and conduct powerful strikes against Hamas targets. This decision comes as violence in Gaza has escalated since the collapse of a ceasefire in March, with Israel also vowing to increase operations against the Houthis in Yemen following a missile strike near Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport. Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions in Gaza are worsening due to the halt of aid, leading to widespread hunger and shortages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline following OPEC+'s decision to increase production for the second consecutive month. The group, led by Saudi Arabia, will raise output by an additional 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' initial forecast. This move brings more than 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market over two months, contributing to a more than 20% drop in oil prices this year. The increased production, coupled with concerns over tariffs and potential recession, has led to reduced investment in exploration and production by oilfield service firms and lower first-quarter earnings for oil majors.

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This adjustment follows criticism that the initial full clawback rate was excessively harsh and could lead to homelessness for beneficiaries reliant on these funds. While experts acknowledge that the reduced rate is an improvement, they still warn that losing half of their benefits can create significant financial strain for affected individuals, especially since overpayments often result from agency errors or unreported changes in circumstances. The agency had briefly increased the withholding rate to 100% before reverting to the 50% rate, sparking concerns about the financial stability of retirees and disabled individuals.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes how Donald Trump's policies, particularly his trade agenda, could weaken the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, potentially leading to long-term economic consequences for Americans. Trump's erratic trade policies have shaken global investors' confidence in America's economic and political stability, leading to increased talk of 'de-dollarization' among bankers and foreign governments. While the dollar's dominance is unlikely to end soon due to the lack of viable alternatives, Trump's policies have increased the odds of its future displacement and driven down its current value, potentially reducing Americans' living standards and increasing borrowing costs for the government.</p>

The arrests follow warnings from Britain's domestic intelligence service, MI5, about a growing threat from attackers linked to Tehran, and reflect the complexity of challenges to national security, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of America's movie industry and a 'National Security threat' due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers. This proposal has sparked concerns within the film industry, with unions warning of a potential 'knock-out blow' and questions arising about the definition of a 'US film' and the scope of the tariffs' application to streaming services. While some countries like Australia and New Zealand have expressed support for their screen industries, others warn that retaliatory tariffs could harm the industry further, making it harder for American films to profit overseas.</p>

          <p>As Israel prepares to deploy tens of thousands of reserve soldiers into Gaza, questions arise about whether this intensified military might will fundamentally alter the conflict's dynamics. Despite 18 months of warfare, Israel has struggled to achieve its goals of destroying Hamas and freeing all hostages, raising doubts about the effectiveness of further escalation. While the Israeli government aims to re-enter Gaza cities and force Hamas to disarm, some experts suggest that a return to such fighting could intensify the deadly conflict and worsen consequences for Palestinians and Israeli hostages. The decision to call up reservists also serves as a message to Netanyahu's hard-line supporters, promising a more intense phase of the war.</p>

The article in Shipborne Weapons suggests that this next-gen fighter could intercept U.S. warplanes and suppress air defenses of bases in Guam, making it difficult for the U.S. Navy and Air Force to maintain air superiority in the western Pacific. This development is framed in the context of perceived weaknesses against the American B-21 stealth bomber, emphasizing the importance of controlling airspace near the Chinese coast in a potential conflict.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's tariffs are not solely based on economic theory, but rather reflect a broader political vision of 'protectionism' aimed at preserving a way of life. The author contends that capitalism needs a new 'spirit' to address the inequalities and injustices of untrammeled greed, suggesting that a democratizing spirit focused on collective well-being is necessary. Policies such as fair trade, industrial policy, and worker representation are proposed as alternatives to Trump's protectivist approach, which risks creating new cycles of dismay.</p>

          <p>Wally Lamb's novel, 'The River Is Waiting,' explores the cascading effects of trauma through the story of Corby, a troubled father who accidentally kills his son and is sentenced to prison. While Lamb has a knack for unpacking dysfunction, Corby is a narcissistic character more concerned with his own plight than the enormity of his actions. The novel delves into Corby's time in prison, but much of what occurs feels cliched, and the ending lacks an authentic epiphany, leaving the reader yearning for a protagonist who evolves and learns from his mistakes.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the impact of Lewis Hine's photographs of child laborers in the early 20th century, which helped to bring about laws protecting children from exploitation. It contrasts the scarcity of images and the outrage generated by Hine's photos in 1908 with today's media-saturated landscape, where images are abundant and skepticism about photographic authenticity arises due to artificial intelligence. The article also highlights the efforts by conservative groups to roll back state child labor laws, and the importance of remembering Hine's work in the current context.</p>
