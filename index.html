          <p>One of the Big Bear bald eaglets, Sunny, successfully took its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow. After days of practice flapping and jumping, Sunny jumped off a branch and flew away, eliciting elation from observers. While Sunny's whereabouts are currently unknown, it's common for young eagles to return to the nest shortly after their initial flight. The eaglets, now nearly 13 weeks old, are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own in the fall, with their future whereabouts unknown as they are not banded.</p>

          <p>British newspapers are leading with the government's Strategic Defence Review, which includes an extra £2 billion for drones and a focus on incorporating tactics from the war in Ukraine to enhance military lethality. The review also highlights plans for 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and suggests a military "gap year" for over-18s, offering a paid year to learn about the military, though national service has been ruled out. Concerns have been raised that the budget delay could hinder efforts to address threats from Russia, while increased spending may lead to tax increases. The newspapers also feature coverage of the renewed search for Madeleine McCann.</p>

          <p>Fluor Field, home to the Greenville Drive, has significantly impacted the local economy and community, drawing roughly half a million people annually for baseball games and other events. The stadium, built in 2006, is a replica of Fenway Park's Green Monster and has generated nearly $300 million in financial impact over the last decade. The ballpark sparked a renaissance in the city's West End downtown, transforming a once-blighted area into a vibrant hub for condos, hotels, and residential neighborhoods. The mixed-use development approach has attracted new businesses and residents, creating a sweet spot for development in Greenville.</p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a legendary figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89, according to the Yomiuri Giants. Nagashima was a key player for the Giants, leading them to nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973, and later managed the club. His charisma and popularity transcended sports, and he became a household name during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. Known as "Mr. Giants," Nagashima's game-winning heroics and flashy fielding helped professional baseball surpass the traditional university game in popularity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans, according to an Education Department spokesperson. This decision marks a policy shift, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The pause offers older student borrowers, particularly those over 62 who are in default, additional time to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. The administration aims to protect Social Security recipients who often rely on fixed incomes.</p>

          <p>Iowa Senator Joni Ernst defended her comment that "we all are going to die" made during a town hall meeting regarding proposed changes to Medicaid. Ernst stated she is compassionate and that the full conversation needs to be considered, while also posting a sarcastic apology video on Instagram. The comments drew criticism from potential opponents, including Nathan Sage and JD Scholten, who announced his Senate candidacy in response. The senator believes the legislation would "focus on those that are most vulnerable" and added, "those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid we will protect."</p>
