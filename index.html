          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in conjunction with Israeli military actions, President Trump hinted at a potential regime change in Iran, raising concerns about further escalation. Israel has also expanded its targets to include sites linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, such as Evin Prison and the Basij paramilitary headquarters. Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Israel, causing disruptions to infrastructure and prompting widespread alerts. The IAEA chief emphasized the need for a return to diplomatic negotiations and IAEA inspections to prevent further escalation and potential nuclear proliferation. Optimism is low given the continued conflict and uncertainty regarding Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran, was detained by ICE during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans, sparking outrage and highlighting the administration's strict enforcement policies. Despite her husband's military service and her attempts to gain legal status, Paola faces deportation due to a prior deportation order issued after her mother missed an immigration hearing. Immigration law experts criticize the agency's shift away from deference to military families, noting that the federal agency now refers them for deportation.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba canceled his trip to the Netherlands for a NATO summit due to heightened tensions in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Despite canceling the summit visit, the Japanese government expressed some support for the U.S. strikes, signaling Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Japan also introduced mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis screening for foreigners staying over three months, starting with those from the Philippines and Nepal, due to rising cases of TB among foreign nationals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament approved a measure to potentially block the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that could significantly disrupt global oil supplies. Experts warn that such a blockade would alienate Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial sea route for about 20% of the world's oil supply, and its closure could lead to higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. While Iran may seek to exert pressure on the U.S. through moderate disruptions, a full closure risks provoking a major response against Iran's oil infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis screening for foreign nationals planning to stay longer than three months, beginning with citizens from the Philippines and Nepal. This measure aims to address the rising number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB while in Japan, predominantly from six specific countries. Individuals will need to provide proof of TB-free status before entering Japan or face denial of entry.

          <p>The U.S.'s direct engagement in the Israel-Iran conflict could intensify its drive to secure critical resources, potentially strengthening China's position in its economic rivalry with Washington. An escalating situation in the Middle East could force the U.S. to allocate more strategic resources there, easing pressure on China in the Indo-Pacific. The need to secure rare earth minerals, critical for modern technology and defense industries, may give Beijing more leverage in trade negotiations. China's control over rare earth production and refining gives it significant leverage, as the U.S. lacks domestic refining capacity.</p>

          <p>Recent high-profile incidents of political violence targeting members of both major parties have raised concerns about a potential surge in American political violence. While data suggests an increase in threats and concerning statements against members of Congress and local officials, it is challenging to determine the exact scale of the problem. Factors contributing to this rise include a volatile political environment and the spread of misinformation on social media. The nature of political violence has also shifted, with individuals unaffiliated with armed groups becoming primary perpetrators, making it harder to track and address the root causes.</p>

He insists he would not give up the captaincy if he made the team, suggesting he could take on a dual role with the help of vice-captains. Bradley's most recent Ryder Cup appearance was in 2014, and he was named captain this time after Tiger Woods declined the opportunity.</p>
