          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made 'substantial progress' in de-escalating the trade war, following high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland. While details remain scarce, Bessent indicated that an agreement had been reached, with further information to be released soon. Both sides have expressed optimism, with President Trump praising the talks for engendering a 'total reset' in the relationship and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng acknowledging 'important progress.' The agreement comes after escalating trade tensions that have seen both countries impose steep tariffs on each other's goods.</p>

          <p>California, despite its economic success and growing population, is entering a challenging period marked by economic, political, social, and environmental pressures. The state faces potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies, a significant budget shortfall in Los Angeles, and a homelessness epidemic. The state's relationship with the federal government has become strained, limiting potential assistance. While some leaders remain optimistic about California's resilience, others express concern over rising costs of living and the state's future, particularly with a new governor set to take office amid political battles and shifting demographics.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks without a cease-fire, diverging from a plan announced by European leaders. These leaders had set a deadline for Russia to accept a cease-fire or face additional sanctions. Ukrainian President Zelensky initially insisted on a halt in fighting but later stated he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey, while civilian casualties have risen since cease-fire talks began. European leaders maintain that only an unconditional cease-fire will prevent additional sanctions on Moscow.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget and education policies are raising concerns among parents of students with disabilities about the future of special education. The Special Education Simplified Funding Program aims to limit federal oversight and provide states with greater flexibility, potentially reducing support for students with disabilities. The article highlights a case in Oklahoma where a student with Down syndrome was placed in segregated classrooms, limiting her learning opportunities and interactions with peers. Without robust federal oversight, the landmark Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) risks becoming ineffective, leading to disparities in education for students with disabilities.</p>
