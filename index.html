        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer defended Lord Mandelson at Prime Minister's Questions, despite No 10 and the Foreign Office reportedly being aware of supportive emails between Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein days earlier. Sources indicate Starmer was not personally informed of the email contents at the time of his initial defense, which became a point of contention. The controversy intensified as Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of misleading the public, calling for full transparency and questioning the government's judgment. Lord Mandelson was subsequently dismissed as the UK's ambassador to the US, with Downing Street citing "new information" regarding the depth and extent of his relationship with Epstein, leading to significant political fallout and scrutiny of the government's handling of the situation.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have escalated their assault on Gaza City with heavy aerial bombardments, targeting entire apartment blocks and leading to widespread civilian displacement. The intensification of strikes, which some residents report hit schools and makeshift shelters, has forced many families to flee south, despite the high costs and Hamas's calls to remain. The UN warns this offensive in an area already facing famine will lead to a deeper catastrophe, while a Qatari official criticized Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, suggesting he is not seeking a peace deal. This article highlights the severe humanitarian impact and international condemnation of the ongoing conflict, exacerbating an already dire situation for civilians.</p>

          <p>Fitness trainer Marfred Suazo, known as Fonz the Trainer, emphasizes strength training as crucial for older adults to maintain functional fitness and prevent age-related decline. He identifies six core movement pillars: push, pull, carry, hinge, overhead press, and squat, which target essential muscle groups for daily activities. Suazo highlights the importance of preserving skeletal muscle, especially for women, to prevent conditions like osteopenia and osteoporosis, calling it the "organ of longevity." The article encourages starting slowly with calisthenics or resistance bands, progressively increasing intensity, and combining strength training with cardiovascular activity and mobility for comprehensive health benefits and improved quality of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The right of women to vote is surprisingly being questioned in America, with conservative influencers and powerful figures amplifying views that challenge universal suffrage. Figures like Braeden Sorbo advocate for a "voting system based on Christian morals" where married couples have one joint vote, claiming young women desire to give up their rights. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and tech billionaire Peter Thiel have also shared or expressed ideas undermining women's individual voting rights. This article highlights a concerning trend where once-fringe views are gaining mainstream traction, suggesting a strategic effort to gradually disenfranchise certain groups by shifting the Overton window and weaponizing legal frameworks, raising alarm about the future of democratic principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Charlie Kirk, the recently deceased far-right activist, significantly shaped US higher education by transforming campuses into cultural battlegrounds. Through his organization, Turning Point USA, Kirk championed staunch bigotry and Christian nationalism, using incendiary debates to challenge what he perceived as leftist indoctrination. His influence extended to establishing a "professor watchlist" and promoting an anti-woke agenda that has since become part of government policy. The article posits that Kirk's activism paved the way for Donald Trump's unprecedented campaign to weaken American universities and subject them to his movement's ideological agenda, fundamentally altering the discourse around academic freedom and political expression on campus.</p>

          <p>Recently dismissed British ambassador Peter Mandelson actively cultivated ties with Donald Trump's conservative circles in Washington D.C., a strategic move given his political past. Mandelson, an architect of New Labour, was the first political ambassador to the US in decades, tasked with building relationships with the new administration. He achieved notable success, including outlining a US-UK trade deal, by acknowledging common political currents between Trump and UK Prime Minister Starmer. His engagement with new conservative media elites and ability to charm Trump were key to his diplomatic approach, despite the controversy surrounding his appointment and later dismissal due to the Epstein scandal, which ultimately overshadowed his efforts.</p>

          <p>The assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk in Utah and a school shooting in Colorado, occurring just minutes apart, underscore the pervasive nature of gun violence in America. Despite the shock and widespread calls for reflection, the article notes a significant absence of substantive debate on gun control reform. Experts suggest that public opinion on gun policy has hardened, making the US seemingly impervious to reform even after horrific incidents like the Newtown and Las Vegas massacres. Kirk himself was a staunch defender of Second Amendment rights, arguing that the benefits of widespread gun ownership outweighed the costs, a stance reflective of the broader political divide on the issue.</p>

          <p>Inflation has accelerated since President Donald Trump implemented new import tariffs in April, with consumer price index data showing notable increases in categories sensitive to these duties. Prices for goods like bananas, coffee, jewelry, televisions, and toys have climbed, with the overall CPI rising to 2.9% in August from a year earlier, drifting further from the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicates tariffs have a "significant impact on prices," with many businesses reporting they are passing these costs on to consumers. Americans now face an average tariff rate of 17.4%, the highest since 1935, potentially costing households an additional $2,300 in 2025.</p>

Rufo, who previously argued against social media posts leading to "professional annihilation," later instigated outrage over a New Yorker writer's old, racist tweets. This article highlights Rufo's evolving philosophy, where he now overtly embraces cancel culture, asserting that "all cultures cancel" and conservatives should establish new norms.

          <p>The Justice Department has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-sharing company systematically discriminates against passengers with disabilities, violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit claims Uber drivers routinely refuse service to individuals with disabilities, charge cleaning fees for service animal shedding, and impose cancellation fees on those unlawfully denied rides. Despite Uber's stated zero-tolerance policy for service denials and investments in accessibility technology, the department highlights numerous instances of passengers experiencing significant delays and being stranded. This article underscores the ongoing challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in accessing essential services and the legal efforts to ensure equal opportunity in transportation.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships commenced in Tokyo, drawing tens of thousands of spectators, four years after the city hosted the pandemic-delayed Olympics without fans. The event is notable for the re-imposed requirement for female athletes to undergo a gene test to determine sex, with 95% complying with the September 1 deadline. World Athletics President Sebastian Coe defends the policy as protecting the integrity of women's sports, though critics view the test as unreliable and a spillover from "culture wars" opposing transgender inclusion. This article highlights the return of major sporting events with fan attendance, but also the ongoing controversy surrounding gender testing in athletics and its broader societal implications for athlete rights and fairness.</p>

          <p>The US economy is showing signs of stagflation—stagnant growth coupled with rising prices—a scenario last seen in the 1970s. Recent data reveals a slowdown in job growth and an increase in annualized inflation to 2.9% in August, reversing earlier positive trends. Economists at Columbia Business School and Brown University largely attribute this concerning trend to the Trump administration's policies, specifically immigration crackdowns reducing the workforce and tariffs driving up consumer costs. The Federal Reserve faces a challenging balancing act, as stagflation complicates traditional interest rate adjustments. The article warns of potential job losses and increased poverty if these economic pressures persist (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Scientists are urging the US to recognize Chagas disease, spread by "kissing bugs," as an endemic illness to increase public awareness and improve diagnosis and treatment. Many people, including a Miami high school student who tested positive after donating blood, are unaware of the disease, which is prevalent in Latin America but also present in at least eight US states. While often asymptomatic initially, Chagas can lead to serious chronic issues like heart failure years later.

          <p>Travel experts, including Google Flights, consistently advise flexibility as the most crucial factor for securing cheap airfare. Shifting travel by even a day or two, particularly flying midweek (Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays), can significantly reduce costs, making tickets up to 13% less expensive than weekend flights. This article debunks the myth that the day of booking heavily influences price, emphasizing that the day of travel is paramount. Additionally, traveling during shoulder or off-peak seasons, opting for layovers, and booking well in advance (around 39-49 days prior for domestic and international flights, respectively) are effective strategies to find more affordable flights and hotel stays.</p>
