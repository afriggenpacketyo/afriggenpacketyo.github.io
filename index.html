The ticket resale marketplace plans to sell over 34 million shares, priced between $22 and $25 each, which would give the company a valuation as high as $9.2 billion. This long-awaited IPO follows previous postponements due to market volatility and signals a potential rebound in the public offering market.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders publicly criticized prominent New York Democratic leaders, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Chuck Schumer, for not endorsing progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani in the city's mayoral race. Speaking at a town hall, Sanders expressed confusion over the party's failure to support its own nominee, who has generated significant grassroots excitement. He framed the issue as a larger struggle for the future direction of the Democratic Party. The lack of endorsements from establishment figures highlights a growing rift between the progressive and centrist wings of the party.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister François Bayrou has been removed from office after losing a no-confidence vote in parliament regarding his proposed austerity measures. This development marks a significant blow to President Emmanuel Macron, who must now appoint his fourth prime minister in under two years or call for new elections. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's push for budget cuts to address France's significant national debt, a move strongly opposed by both left-wing and far-right parties. The political turmoil highlights the deep divisions within the French parliament and the challenges facing Macron's government.</p>

          <p>A new mural attributed to the street artist Banksy has emerged on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork portrays a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, and its appearance follows recent mass arrests at a protest in the city. Court officials have covered the piece and stated it will be removed, citing the building's listed status which requires its original character to be maintained. Banksy authenticated the work via an Instagram post, continuing a theme of creating art that is critical of government and legal systems.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets amid growing global economic uncertainty. This represents a significant increase of over 38% since the beginning of the year, prompting questions about whether it is too late for new investors to buy in. Despite the record prices, some financial analysts predict that the precious metal's value could continue to climb, potentially reaching $4,000 by mid-2026.

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, stating that the ruling returned the issue of abortion to the states' democratic processes. She addressed criticisms that the court is enabling executive overreach and discussed the personal threats she and other justices have faced, revealing she owns a bulletproof vest. Barrett emphasized that the role of a justice is to interpret the law, not to create policy or follow a political agenda.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted lower court restrictions on aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in central California, allowing federal agents to resume challenged practices. The decision overturns a temporary restraining order that had been imposed after critics argued the tactics amounted to unconstitutional racial profiling. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated that while ethnicity alone is not sufficient for reasonable suspicion, it can be a relevant factor in immigration stops. The court's three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor calling the decision a misuse of the court's emergency powers and a threat to constitutional freedoms.</p>

The case stems from defamatory statements Trump made while denying Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.

Debt relief encompasses various methods, including debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, and credit counseling, which offers structured debt management plans. More aggressive options like debt settlement involve negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, while bankruptcy offers a legal path to eliminating or restructuring debts. This article explains that while these tools can provide significant financial relief, they often come with consequences for one's credit score and long-term financial health.

          <p>Germany is remembering Enver Simsek, a Turkish-born florist who became the first of ten victims murdered by the neo-Nazi terrorist group National Socialist Underground (NSU) twenty-five years ago. For over a decade, the series of racially motivated killings went unsolved, with police wrongly suspecting the victims' families of involvement in organized crime. The NSU's existence was only discovered in 2011, shocking the nation and exposing significant failures within German security agencies. Simsek's daughter, Semiya, continues to advocate for a full accounting of the group's accomplices and the systemic issues that allowed the terror cell to operate undetected for so long.</p>

The move, which had been a subject of Wall Street speculation for months, is a significant milestone for the company that went public in 2021. Inclusion in the benchmark index typically triggers substantial buying from passive index funds, which must hold shares of its component companies. Robinhood's stock has seen a dramatic rise of over 210% year-to-date, reflecting strong performance and investor confidence in its growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

This acquisition follows a partnership with T-Mobile and positions SpaceX to become a direct mobile service provider. The transaction also provides significant financial and regulatory relief for EchoStar, which owns the struggling Dish Network and has been under pressure to utilize its spectrum assets.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to take back their own citizens who are in the UK illegally. The proposal was discussed during a meeting of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance, which includes the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This potential policy shift comes as the UK government faces mounting pressure to address the increasing number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats.

          <p>With recent data indicating a weakening U.S. job market, individuals facing unemployment may have several options for managing their federal student loan debt. Financial experts recommend applying for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can lower monthly payments, sometimes to zero, based on current income, including unemployment benefits. Another option is to apply for an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments, although interest may still accrue on some loans. Borrowers with private student loans have fewer standard options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to discuss potential hardship assistance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has significantly escalated its aerial attacks on Ukraine, launching the largest single-day strike of the war over the weekend with over 800 drones and 13 missiles. This intensification is part of a strategy to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, destroy critical infrastructure, and instill fear among the civilian population. According to military analysts, Russia is diversifying its strike packages with more cost-effective drones to achieve a greater scale of destruction. The pattern of record-breaking attacks suggests that Moscow is not interested in a ceasefire and is committed to a long-term strategy of attrition through sustained aerial bombardment.</p>

The proposed change would likely allow for voting on large groups of non-controversial nominees at once, bypassing the ability of a single senator to delay the process.

The survey found that 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism, compared to only 42% for capitalism, a reversal from previous years. Among Republicans, support for capitalism remains strong while views on socialism are overwhelmingly negative. This trend, particularly pronounced among younger Democrats, highlights a growing internal debate within the party and reflects broader concerns about economic inequality and the role of big business in the country.</p>
