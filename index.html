          <p>Bryan Kohberger was sentenced to four consecutive life terms without parole for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. During the emotional sentencing hearing, victims' families delivered powerful statements, expressing their profound grief and condemning Kohberger's actions. Kohberger, who pleaded guilty as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty, declined to speak when offered the opportunity. The judge emphasized the inexplicable nature of the crimes and criticized Kohberger's lack of remorse, aiming to end his notoriety.</p>

          <p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the Trump administration's Department of Health and Human Services violated the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. This violation occurred by significantly reducing the disbursement rate of congressionally appropriated funds for the Head Start program, intended for early childhood development. The GAO based its findings on publicly available evidence, as HHS failed to provide requested information. This action underscores concerns about the executive branch's adherence to the separation of powers regarding appropriated funds.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with its digital gaming division, particularly "Magic: The Gathering" and "Monopoly Go!", significantly boosting performance. This growth helped to counterbalance a decline in the traditional toy business, which faced pressure from tariffs and retailer order timing. Despite a net loss primarily due to a goodwill impairment and tariff impacts, the company raised its full-year guidance, indicating optimism for continued revenue growth and improved margins. Hasbro is implementing cost reductions and diversifying suppliers to mitigate tariff effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is debating the reintroduction of compulsory military service, prompted by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius's concerns about growing security threats and the need to strengthen the Bundeswehr. While the military aims to increase its active personnel significantly, employers' associations express worry that mandatory service could negatively impact the labor market by delaying young people's entry. Pistorius proposes a hybrid model of voluntary and selective conscription, with President Steinmeier supporting the move due to Europe's tense security situation and US government stances.</p>

          <p>Despite Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea in the Idaho murders, the public remains without a clear explanation for his motive, as he declined to speak at sentencing. The lack of a trial, due to the plea deal, means much information from the extensive investigation will likely remain unrevealed. New media, including documentaries and a book, are attempting to provide context through victim perspectives and insights into Kohberger's troubled academic history and alleged dark tendencies, including a potential fixation on one victim.
