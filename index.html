          <p>Shares of Orsted, a wind farm developer, fell sharply by 17% to a record low after the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order for its nearly completed Revolution Wind Project off Rhode Island. The project is 80% complete, but the halt raises significant financial uncertainties for Orsted, which is in the process of a major capital raise. Analysts warn of potential double-digit billion write-downs and increased capital requirements if the project cannot proceed, though Orsted remains optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniil Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, was eliminated in the first round after a chaotic match against Benjamin Bonzi, marred by a photographer entering the court during a match point. The disruption led to an umpire's decision to re-serve, sparking an furious outburst from Medvedev and a six-minute delay. Despite a spirited comeback to force a fifth set, Medvedev ultimately lost, smashing his racket in frustration. The photographer's credentials were revoked following the incident.</p>

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on her 2015 decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees, stating it was guided by humanitarian principles. In an interview for an upcoming documentary, Merkel acknowledged the policy's challenges and its contribution to the rise of the far-right AfD party. Despite criticism, she maintains the decision was morally necessary, emphasizing that using force to prevent entry was never an option. Integrating the large number of refugees continues to be a significant challenge for Germany.</p>

          <p>France has summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to Paris after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron, accusing France of not doing enough to combat antisemitism. The French foreign ministry deemed Kushner's allegations "unacceptable" and a violation of international law regarding non-interference in internal affairs. Kushner's letter linked French statements on Israel and Palestinian state recognition to rising antisemitism, a claim France firmly rejects. This diplomatic discord adds to existing tensions in French-U.S. relations.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., students are returning to school amidst President Trump's deployment of over 2,000 National Guard troops, a move D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser deems unnecessary. Bowser insists local agencies are capable of ensuring student safety, highlighting recent improvements in proficiency rates. While some local law enforcement find the federal presence helpful, concerns about the use of troops and their impact on community trust persist. Philadelphia is also focusing on local safety initiatives, including 'safety zones' and community programs, as its students return to classrooms.</p>

Lee expressed reluctance to easily agree, as South Korea primarily views North Korea as its main threat and wishes to avoid entanglement in a conflict with China. The leaders will also discuss a trade deal, with South Korea pledging $350 billion in U.S. investments, mostly in loans and guarantees, to lower tariffs.

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated federal funding for California's Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) due to its inclusion of 'radical gender ideology' in curricula. The administration argues that California's 'Teen Talk' program, which discusses gender identity and body alteration, exceeds PREP's statutory purpose of preventing pregnancy and STIs with medically accurate information. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office refused to modify the content, leading to the funding cut. This move aligns with the Trump administration's stance on protecting children from content it deems contradictory to 'commonsense biology'.</p>

Experts suggest these blunders stem from 'empathy failures,' where brands use outdated boardroom thinking to navigate complex cultural issues. While some brands, like Gap, successfully connect with consumers, others risk alienating audiences by appearing inauthentic. The heightened consumer scrutiny in the age of social media means brands must genuinely understand culture rather than merely avoid offense, balancing risk for attention against potential backlash.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged over 14% in Hong Kong, extending a seven-session gain, following the unveiling of its new ES8 SUV. Priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) with a battery subscription plan, the ES8 is Nio's most affordable model, targeting a broader market amid intense competition. This strategic move aims to capture a wider customer base, complementing Nio's recent launches of cheaper brands, Onvo and Firefly. Deliveries for the ES8 are scheduled to begin in late September, as the company adapts to evolving market pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest rate since January 2021. This moderation was driven by falling retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, below forecasts. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects inflation to remain moderate, citing easing global crude oil and food commodity prices, and slower nominal wage growth. This trend strengthens the case for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in its upcoming October meeting to buffer against weaker economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
