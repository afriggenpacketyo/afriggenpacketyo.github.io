          <p>Following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been assigned a U.S. Secret Service protective detail. This measure, while uncommon for press secretaries, is not without precedent and comes as Congress considers a $58 million funding increase for the security of executive and judicial officials. The move highlights growing concerns about the safety of high-profile public figures in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, U.S. President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to control the country's borders and stop illegal migration. Trump drew parallels between the UK's situation with Channel crossings and the U.S. southern border, warning that such migration "destroys countries from within." The comments came during a press conference where Starmer defended his government's "one in, one out" deportation deal with France, highlighting the differing approaches to a shared political challenge.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former paramilitary revolutionary forced out of hiding. The reviewer praises the movie as an "electrifying, thoughtful blockbuster" that powerfully engages with contemporary themes of political violence and government overreach, a departure from the director's typically historical settings. The film is described as a visceral and emotional triumph, blending intense action sequences with a compelling story about resisting authoritarianism, featuring strong performances from its cast.</p>

          <h2>Germany to Increase Price of Popular Nationwide Public Transit Ticket</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 15:39:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transportation ministers from Germany's 16 federal states have unanimously agreed to raise the price of the "Deutschlandticket," a popular monthly public transit pass. The cost will increase to €63 per month starting in January 2026, up from its current price of €58. While officials framed it as a necessary compromise to ensure the program's continuation through 2030, mobility associations criticized the move, warning it could undermine passenger trust and lead to cancellations, as a previous price hike did.</p>

          <p>This article explores the free speech implications of the government's response to criticism following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Legal experts express concern over actions such as the State Department revoking visas and Attorney General Pam Bondi vowing to "go after" hate speech, noting that the Supreme Court has historically protected most forms of offensive speech. The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, following pressure from the FCC, is highlighted as a particularly troubling development, with critics arguing the administration is using government power to suppress lawful expression.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny revealed he deliberately excluded the 50 U.S. states from his current world tour out of concern that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents "could be outside my concert." This decision highlights a growing climate of fear among performers and audiences, as well as logistical hurdles for foreign artists seeking visas to perform in the U.S. In response, the Department of Homeland Security dismissed the singer's concerns as "fearmongering," while arts presenters note that visa delays are creating significant uncertainty for international tours.</p>

          <p>A jury has found a Los Angeles protester not guilty of assaulting a U.S. Border Patrol agent during a demonstration against immigration raids in June. The acquittal of Brayan Ramos-Brito is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents who testified, including a senior chief. Witness footage showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault, and the trial revealed factual discrepancies in official reports about the incident.</p>

Despite previous unsuccessful bids for the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles, he continues to pursue this localized growth model, which he compares to a tech company with recurring subscription revenue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay from The Atlantic examines the historical tension within American higher education, which has been pulled between three distinct goals: cultural formation, career preparation, and academic research. It contrasts the 19th-century classical college model, focused on "culture," with the vision of Harvard President Charles W. Eliot, who championed a more practical, career-oriented university. The article argues that this fundamental debate over the purpose of college has never been resolved, leading to the modern hybrid university where debates over the "return on investment" of a degree continue.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has carried out its first deportation under a new pilot agreement with France, sending an Indian national who crossed the Channel in a small boat to Paris. The "one in, one out" scheme is intended to deter illegal crossings by establishing a system of mutual migrant exchanges. The move comes amid ongoing legal challenges from other migrants slated for removal, with the High Court rejecting one last-minute attempt to block a flight but granting a temporary block in another case on modern slavery grounds.</p>
