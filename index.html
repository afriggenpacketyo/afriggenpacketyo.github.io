          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held what Modi described as an "insightful" meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation summit in China. The friendly exchange, which included a shared car ride, is viewed as a signal of their strong bilateral relationship. This meeting occurs as India faces significant U.S. tariffs, imposed by President Trump as a penalty for India's continued purchase of Russian oil and weapons. Despite the economic pressure from Washington, India has shown no intention of altering its strategic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Following a congressional decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the United States are facing severe financial challenges. Stations are launching emergency fundraising drives, with many seeing an unexpectedly strong response from local communities, while the national networks are reducing dues to provide relief. Despite this support, some stations have already been forced to cut staff and programming, such as KSPS in Spokane, which lost a significant portion of its budget. The long-term survival of more vulnerable stations, particularly in rural areas, remains uncertain.</p>

The picks include Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, and Jon Rahm, resulting in a team with 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Donald warned against expecting a simple repeat of their previous strategy, emphasizing that playing on American soil presents a different challenge that will require new tactics. He also urged his players to embrace the anticipated raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal with Crystal Palace for the transfer of England center-back Marc Guehi, pending final ratification from the selling club. The 25-year-old defender is set to undergo a medical and sign a long-term contract after the clubs settled on a transfer fee.

Guehi's transfer marks a key acquisition for the Premier League champions, who are looking to solidify their backline for domestic and European competitions.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has written a satirical short story to criticize a new book ban policy in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of Atwood's own celebrated novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some schools. Her new story mockingly describes perfectly chaste characters to highlight the absurdity of the censorship. This move is part of a broader trend of book challenges, originating in the U.S., that is now impacting Canadian schools and drawing criticism from literary figures.</p>

          <p>A study by researchers at the University of Montpellier has found that human activities began to have a divergent effect on the body sizes of wild and domestic animals during the Middle Ages. While domesticated species like sheep and chickens grew larger due to selective breeding, wild species such as foxes and deer became smaller. Scientists attribute the shrinking of wild animals to habitat fragmentation from human settlements and intensified hunting practices. This research, based on the analysis of over 225,000 animal bones from southern France, highlights the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly implemented a near-total ban on non-immigrant visitor visas for individuals using Palestinian Authority passports. According to media reports citing a diplomatic cable, U.S. consular officers have been instructed to refuse visas to nearly all applicants, affecting those seeking to travel for business, study, or tourism. This move expands on a recent pause on visas for residents of Gaza and follows the denial of entry for dozens of Palestinian officials. The State Department has not explicitly confirmed the blanket ban but stated it is taking steps in compliance with U.S. law and national security.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly urged pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs, stating that he wants an answer "NOW" amid public debate and recent leadership turmoil at the CDC. His comments follow the FDA's decision to limit the latest vaccine approvals to high-risk individuals and the recent firing of the CDC director. Trump noted he has seen "extraordinary" information from companies like Pfizer but questioned why these results are not more transparent to the public. He also referenced his administration's Operation Warp Speed, expressing hope that it was as brilliant as claimed.</p>

          <p>A new documentary film, "The Haydn Expedition," highlights the unique democratic structure of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB), a world-renowned German orchestra. Founded by music students in 1980, the DKB operates on a grassroots model where all 41 musicians have a say in key artistic and operational decisions, from repertoire selection to financial management. This collaborative approach, once compared to a hippie commune, is credited with fostering deep personal investment from its members and driving the ensemble's artistic excellence. The film connects this ethos to the democratic ideals present in the music of composer Joseph Haydn.</p>

Climate scientists at the agency note that a summer this hot is now 70 times more likely due to human-induced climate change.

          <p>A detailed plan for the post-war redevelopment of Gaza, reportedly being considered by the Trump administration, envisions transforming the territory into a high-tech hub called the "Gaza Riviera." The 38-page document proposes placing Gaza under U.S. trusteeship for a decade, funding the project with private investment, and building AI-powered smart cities. A controversial component of the plan involves the "voluntary" relocation of Gaza's entire population, either abroad or to temporary housing, in exchange for digital tokens representing their property rights. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism for its implications of mass displacement and its disregard for Palestinian self-determination.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement could severely damage key sectors of California's $4 trillion economy, which heavily relies on immigrant labor. A study from the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced estimates that the state could lose up to $278 billion from its GDP due to mass deportations and stricter border policies. Industries like agriculture and construction, which have the highest concentrations of immigrant and undocumented workers, would be particularly hard-hit by labor shortages. The findings underscore the essential role immigrant workers play in sustaining California's economic output. This article contains data about the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Other hikers and staff from a nearby refuge administered first aid before the pair was airlifted to a hospital. The man succumbed to his injuries before he could undergo surgery. Fatal cow attacks are rare, but this incident has brought renewed attention to government-issued safety guidelines for hikers in areas with grazing cattle.</p>
