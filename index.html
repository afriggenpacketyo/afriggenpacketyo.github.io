          <p>Research indicates a notable surge in rare appendix cancer diagnoses among millennials and Gen X, with diagnoses tripling for those born between 1976 and 1984 and quadrupling for those born between 1981 and 1989 in the U.S. Researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program to arrive at these findings. Early stages of the disease often present no symptoms, but as it progresses, individuals may experience pain, bloating, nausea, and a mass in the abdomen. The researchers are advocating for heightened awareness among the public and medical professionals, given the lack of standard screening guidelines and risk factors.</p>

          <p>US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip), a panel responsible for issuing official government recommendations on immunizations. Kennedy stated that the committee was plagued with conflicts of interest, claiming that most members received substantial funding from pharmaceutical companies, undermining public trust in vaccinations. Public health experts have expressed concerns that Kennedy may appoint vaccine-skeptics to the board, potentially leading to further declines in vaccination rates and resurgences of preventable diseases. The American Medical Association criticized the move, saying it "upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives."</p>

The endorsement highlights the complex dynamics of the race, as Cuomo seeks to return to public office after resigning from the governorship.

          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees across several divisions, including Search, Ads, and Commerce, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the 2023 layoffs. The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, with some teams also mandating office returns for remote workers near offices. This move follows finance chief Anat Ashkenazi's emphasis on cost-cutting as Google increases spending on AI infrastructure for 2025. The Knowledge and Information unit, housing Google's search, ads, and commerce divisions, underwent reorganization in October, with executive Nick Fox encouraging well-performing employees to stay while offering a supportive exit for those not aligned with the company's strategy.</p>

The chancellor will emphasize plans to invest £113bn in infrastructure projects while some government departments are likely to face real-terms cuts. The review will cover the Labour government's spending up to the next general election, expected in 2029, with day-to-day spending outlined for the next three years and investment budgets for the next four. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that tough choices are "unavoidable," with some departments facing spending cuts due to sluggish economic growth and higher borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>McDonald's shares experienced a decline following a downgrade by Redburn Atlantic, citing concerns that the increasing popularity of weight-loss drugs could negatively impact the fast-food chain's earnings. Analysts predict that McDonald's could lose up to 28 million customer visits, resulting in a revenue loss of $482 million per year, due to changes in eating habits influenced by GLP-1 drugs. The report suggests that brands catering to lower-income consumers, like McDonald's, are particularly vulnerable. However, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh argues that McDonald's faces more pressing challenges and doesn't expect GLP-1s to significantly affect earnings in the near term, as the core customer base may not be able to afford such drugs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>California Senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla are requesting clarification from the Pentagon regarding the deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles, citing concerns over the legal basis and the mission's objectives. The senators highlight that the deployment occurred over the objections of state authorities, raising questions about federal overreach. They seek details on the training the Marines have received for crowd control and the rules of engagement they will follow. The senators also inquire whether the Defense Department received requests from the White House or the Department of Homeland Security regarding the Marines' mission.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids. Newsom argues that Trump's actions are unlawful and exacerbate tensions, violating the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Trump defends the deployments, claiming they are necessary to prevent Los Angeles from "burning" due to the protests. The lawsuit argues that the protests do not constitute a rebellion or insurrection, despite Trump's claims.</p>

          <p>A large international study has found a two-way link between screen time and emotional well-being in children. Increased screen time is associated with a higher risk of developing issues such as aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, and children already struggling with social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Time spent on gaming consoles was particularly linked to these issues. The study recommends limiting recreational screen time for children and ensuring it does not interfere with sleep and physical activity.</p>
