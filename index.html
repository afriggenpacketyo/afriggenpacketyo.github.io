          <p>Israel initiated a series of airstrikes targeting locations in Iran, claiming they were connected to Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the death of Hossein Salami, the Commander-in-Chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Following the strikes, Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency, warning of potential missile and drone attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would continue until the threat was removed, leading to the cancellation of flights at Tel Aviv's airport. Iranian state media reported multiple fatalities in Tehran, with additional strikes hitting Natanz, Khandab, and Khoramabad, targeting military officers and nuclear scientists. The optimism score reflects the escalation of conflict and potential for further instability. </p>

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and research scientists, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who dubbed the operation "Operation Rising Lion" aimed at rolling back the Iranian threat.

The United States denied involvement, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating Israel took unilateral action for self-defense. Iranian media reported explosions and casualties in Tehran and strikes in Natanz, while the IDF stated the offensive was a preemptive strike against Iran's nuclear program, citing its proximity to obtaining a nuclear weapon.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that California officials were likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles. Breyer stated that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, circumventing Newsom in calling the National Guard into federal service. The Justice Department appealed the order, while Newsom praised the decision as a victory for the Constitution and democracy, but the situation still reflects political tensions and legal challenges. </p>

          <p>A federal judge deemed President Donald Trump's federalization of California National Guard troops in Los Angeles as illegal and ordered him to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stayed the order temporarily to allow the Trump administration to appeal, which they promptly did. Trump had federalized 4,000 National Guard members and mobilized 700 Marines in response to protests against federal immigration enforcement actions. Newsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's action, arguing it was the first time a president had taken such an action without the governor's consent. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting a check on executive power but ongoing political division.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel struck one of Iran’s top nuclear facilities, the Natanz Nuclear Facility, in response to Iran's uranium enrichment program. Netanyahu stated that Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs and is taking steps to weaponize this uranium. The Natanz facility, flagged by experts, could produce enough weapons-grade uranium to produce 11 nuclear weapons within a month. Netanyahu asserted that Israel struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment and weaponization programs, targeting the main enrichment facility in Natanz and leading nuclear scientists.

The nation's STEM graduates significantly outnumber those of the US, and most top officials are engineers. This focus on engineering is considered a matter of national security and priority, highlighting China's unique approach to development.

The incident involved an alleged physical altercation, with witnesses claiming Brown was the shooter, and video footage appearing to show Brown grabbing a security officer's gun and firing at a victim. The alleged victim, who knew Brown since 2022, stated Brown shot at him twice, potentially grazing his neck, leading to a fight over the gun until police arrived.

          <p>Research by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were already domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were eating humans' cooked foods and waste. The findings suggest the domestication process of Sus scrofa occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, adding a new perspective to the history of animal domestication. The optimism score is high, reflecting the positive contribution to historical knowledge.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed that the Trump administration will continue its crackdown on immigrants and protesters in Los Angeles. Noem stated that immigration agents were preparing to round up "literally tens of thousands of targets" in Los Angeles. The press conference was interrupted when U.S. Senator Alex Padilla confronted her and was subsequently detained. Large anti-Trump demonstrations are being planned in Los Angeles and other cities, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott deploying 5,000 National Guard troops to support local police.

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are proceeding with overseas expansion to ensure survival amid Trump's tariffs, as production abroad is key to their long-term viability. Despite a US-China truce in the tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with nearly 80% of their planned overseas capacity expansion in the Middle East and Africa. This shift reflects the industry's need to localize production abroad to overcome trade barriers. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the adaptability of businesses despite trade tensions.

The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals announced that members voted overwhelmingly in favor, granting leaders the authority to call a strike.

The union contends that a staffing shortage has hurt service and working conditions, while the companies have allegedly broken labor laws by engaging in unlawful surveillance and retaliation.

          <p>Donald Trump ordered the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings of potential chaos and increased risk of catastrophic blazes. The order aims to centralize efforts currently split among multiple agencies and departments, creating a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the US interior department. This would involve shifting personnel from the Forest Service, with critics arguing it could disrupt firefighting efforts during peak season. The administration cited the Los Angeles wildfires as highlighting the need for quicker responses, but the order makes no mention of climate change.

The attack comes amid increasing tensions over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, with the Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency recently censuring Iran.
