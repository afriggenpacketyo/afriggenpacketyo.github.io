        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to increase the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 is causing alarm among tech industry experts. Critics argue the substantial cost increase could severely hinder startups' ability to hire top international talent, effectively "kneecapping" their growth and competitiveness. While some major tech executives have praised the change, many experts warn it could drive skilled professionals to other countries like China or Canada. This shift could potentially weaken American innovation, especially in the crucial field of artificial intelligence, by creating significant financial barriers for smaller, less-capitalized companies.

          <p>A report reveals the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) improperly used journalists' phone numbers to identify internal leaks from officers and staff. The investigation, covering 2011 to 2024, uncovered 21 instances of unlawful surveillance to find reporters' sources, double the number previously admitted. The practice involved cross-referencing thousands of calls against a list of journalists' numbers provided to the PSNI press office. The report's author criticized this as disproportionate and a significant concern for data protection and freedom of expression, prompting the PSNI Chief Constable to acknowledge the need for process improvements.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to his show with an emotional monologue following a week-long suspension by ABC. He addressed the controversy surrounding his comments on the MAGA movement's reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's murder, stating it was never his intention to make light of the tragedy. Kimmel defended his show's role in a country with free speech protections, while acknowledging the political pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC. The return came amid a boycott from several local ABC affiliates, highlighting the intense political division surrounding the incident and its free speech implications.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgages in the U.S. saw minimal growth last week, stalling after a significant surge in refinancing activity the previous week. Total application volume increased by only 0.6%, even as the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate fell to its lowest point since September 2024. The mini-boom in refinancing applications, which had spiked dramatically, leveled off with just a 1% weekly increase. Applications for home purchases remained flat, suggesting that while buyer demand is stronger than last year, the market's momentum has paused amid recent rate volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Carolina's legislature has passed "Iryna's Law," a bill aimed at eliminating cashless bail for many offenses. The legislation is named after Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee who was fatally stabbed in what police called a random attack on a Charlotte light rail train. The bill introduces stricter pretrial release guidelines for defendants charged with violent crimes or those with extensive criminal histories.

          <p>A former stylist for Sean "Diddy" Combs has filed a lawsuit accusing the music mogul of sexual abuse, violence, and human trafficking. The plaintiff, Deonte Nash, who worked for Combs for a decade and testified in his recent federal criminal trial, alleges he endured years of abuse and threats. The lawsuit details specific incidents, including one where Combs allegedly strangled Nash over a disagreement. This legal action follows Combs' recent conviction on prostitution-related charges and adds to the growing number of accusations of abuse and violence leveled against him by former associates and partners.</p>

          <p>While the number of journalists killed in the Philippines has decreased since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office, press freedom advocates warn that intimidation and a culture of impunity persist. Global press freedom rankings for the country have slightly improved, a change the administration attributes to its respect for journalism. However, reporters and rights groups point to ongoing issues like politically motivated prosecutions, such as the case of detained journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio. They also highlight "red-tagging," where authorities accuse journalists of supporting communist insurgencies, creating a chilling effect on critical reporting despite fewer overt acts of violence.</p>

          <p>In a significant ruling for the trial of Soldier F, a judge has decided that witness statements given by other soldiers in 1972 can be used as evidence. Soldier F, a former paratrooper, denies murdering two people and attempting to murder five others during the Bloody Sunday massacre in Londonderry. The prosecution argued that statements from two fellow soldiers, one deceased and one unwilling to testify, are the only evidence proving Soldier F fired at civilians. The defense had challenged the reliability of these decades-old statements, but the judge's decision allows them to be formally submitted in the trial.</p>

While expressing that he never intended to make light of Charlie Kirk's murder, Kimmel focused his speech on the broader, chilling implications of the FCC chairman's comments and the pressure on his network, ABC.

          <p>Researchers have announced a major breakthrough in treating Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, with a new gene therapy. The treatment, delivered via brain surgery, has been shown to slow the disease's clinical progression by an average of 75% in trial patients three years after the procedure. This could potentially extend patients' quality of life by decades and offers hope that early intervention could even prevent symptoms from appearing. The therapy works by permanently reducing levels of the toxic huntingtin protein that kills brain cells, marking a pivotal moment of hope for affected families.</p>

          <p>Following his murder, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being transformed into a martyr figure within the MAGA movement, a process that could help it evolve from a personality-driven campaign into a more enduring political faith. This veneration blurs Kirk's specific Pentecostal background into a generic "Christian" identity tied explicitly to nationalist politics, mirroring how early religions used martyrs to inspire followers and consolidate power. The narrative being crafted around his death, including calls for retribution alongside messages of forgiveness, serves to galvanize supporters and frame the political struggle in existential, quasi-religious terms that could outlast any single leader.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has indicated the league may seek to renegotiate its massive media rights deals as early as 2026, well before the current contract's 2029 opt-out clause. An earlier deal could secure billions in additional revenue for the league and its teams, while allowing media partners like Disney, Comcast, and Amazon to extend their control over the nation's most-watched programming. Goodell cited the rapidly changing media landscape as the reason for wanting flexibility, suggesting both the NFL and its partners could be incentivized to update the agreements sooner rather than later to capitalize on the high value of live sports.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians have responded with a mix of hope and caution to President Donald Trump's unexpected declaration that their country can win the war and reclaim all territory from Russia. This marks a significant pivot from his previous stance, which suggested Ukraine would need to concede land for peace. While some Kyiv residents expressed hope that Trump's words will translate into tangible U.S. support, others remain wary of his unpredictability and past rhetoric. The shift comes after Trump's meeting with President Zelenskyy, leaving many in Ukraine to wait and see if this new-found optimism will be backed by concrete action from Washington.</p>

          <p>Global defense stocks surged following President Donald Trump's major rhetorical shift, in which he stated that Ukraine could win the war and retake all its territory from Russia. Shares of European defense firms like Germany's Renk and Hensoldt, Italy's Leonardo, and Sweden's Saab all saw significant gains. This market reaction reflects investor belief that the new stance could lead to prolonged or increased military support for Ukraine, benefiting companies that produce weapons and military equipment. The president's comments, which also included a call for NATO to shoot down Russian jets violating its airspace, have bolstered confidence in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major policy reversal, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine can win its war against Russia and regain all its original territory. This new position, announced on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, is a stark departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede land to achieve peace. Trump attributed his change of heart to a better understanding of the military situation and Russia's significant economic troubles, which he believes create an opportunity for Ukraine to act. He also likened Russia to a "paper tiger," citing its struggles in the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>A number of influential right-leaning podcasters and YouTubers, who were instrumental in Donald Trump's rise, appear to be growing disillusioned with his second term. While some hosts remain loyal, others like Joe Rogan and Andrew Schulz have become more critical of the administration's policies on issues like government transparency, tariffs, and foreign policy. This fragmentation within the "manosphere" media ecosystem, which reaches millions of young male listeners, could signal a challenge for Trump's political coalition. The shift from enthusiastic support to jaded criticism or apathy suggests that the unconventional alliance that helped elect him may be showing signs of strain.</p>

          <p>While the prospect of colonizing Mars is gaining serious consideration, a major obstacle remains: the human body is not equipped for long-duration space travel. The nascent field of space medicine is working to address the significant health risks astronauts face, such as bone density loss, muscle atrophy, and radiation exposure. Researchers are studying these effects through analogs like NASA's twins study and exploring solutions like AI-assisted diagnostics and personalized countermeasures. Advances in this field not only pave the way for future interplanetary missions but also yield significant benefits for medicine on Earth, from remote monitoring to accelerated disease research.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that California Democrats, under Governor Gavin Newsom, are adopting a more pragmatic, results-oriented approach to governing that could serve as a model for the national party. While still resisting the Trump administration on key issues, leaders are also making centrist moves to address voter concerns about affordability and quality of life. Examples include reforming environmental laws to streamline housing construction, cracking down on crime in San Francisco, and balancing clean energy goals with economic realities. This shift towards practical governance reflects an effort to meet voters where they are and deliver tangible improvements, moving beyond purely ideological battles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to claims from figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about an autism "epidemic," scientists and psychologists are clarifying the reasons behind the steady increase in diagnoses. Experts assert that the rise is not due to a new environmental cause but is primarily an artifact of an expanded diagnostic definition and increased screening. The criteria for autism spectrum disorder have broadened significantly over decades, now encompassing a wider range of behaviors that were previously categorized differently or overlooked. Furthermore, improved awareness and proactive screening, especially in historically underserved communities, have led to more children being correctly identified, rather than an actual increase in the condition's prevalence.</p>
