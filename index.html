          <p>Valentino Luchin, a 62-year-old distinguished chef from San Francisco, has been arrested for allegedly robbing three banks within the city's Central District on a single day. Authorities state that Luchin passed notes demanding money to tellers at each location before being identified and apprehended. This is not his first encounter with such charges, as he previously admitted to a 2018 bank robbery, which he attributed to severe financial struggles after his restaurant closed. Luchin is currently in jail facing multiple charges of robbery and attempted robbery.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are formally questioning whether a Boar's Head deli meat plant in Jarratt, Virginia, is safe to reopen after it was linked to a fatal listeria outbreak. A letter sent to the company by Representative Rosa DeLauro and other Democrats requests that officials testify before the Congressional Food Safety Caucus about what they term a "repeated pattern of food safety negligence." The inquiry was prompted by reports of ongoing sanitation issues at other Boar's Head facilities, raising concerns that systemic problems have not been resolved since the initial outbreak that caused 10 deaths and a massive product recall.</p>

The initiative, requested by Tennessee's governor, will establish a multi-agency task force modeled after similar efforts in Washington, D.C. The President has indicated that Chicago and St. Louis could be next for federal intervention, framing the move as a necessary step to restore safety in cities with significant crime problems. This follows a controversial deployment in Los Angeles that faced legal challenges over the use of military for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is facing scrutiny for his use of social media during the investigation into the killing of activist Charlie Kirk, including a post that prematurely announced a suspect was in custody. Patel defended his actions, stating he was being transparent with the public, though he conceded his wording could have been better. The incident highlights a significant culture clash within the FBI, as Patel's active online presence contrasts sharply with the traditionally cautious communication style of his predecessors. Critics, including former agents, argue that real-time updates on sensitive investigations can jeopardize the legal process and that an FBI director cannot also be a social media influencer.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that California, despite its massive economy, now shares the highest poverty rate in the nation with Louisiana, at 17.7%. The report from the California Budget and Policy Center indicates that seven million residents lack the resources to meet basic needs, largely driven by the state's exorbitant housing costs. This marks a significant increase from a historic low in 2021, which was achieved through expanded public benefits during the pandemic. The rollback of these supportive policies is cited as a primary reason for the sharp rise in poverty, which disproportionately affects children, seniors, and Black and Latino populations.

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," officially named the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, which will legally require public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. This landmark legislation, championed by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, establishes a "duty of candour" and threatens criminal sanctions for non-compliance. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law aims to end the "culture of cover-ups" seen not only in the Hillsborough case but also in other national scandals like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon crisis.</p>

The law establishes a legal "duty of candour" for public officials and aims to create parity in legal funding for victims of state-related disasters, ensuring others do not face the same institutional obstacles.</p>

The whale, identified as J36, was seen pushing the female calf, which was estimated to be near full term and no more than three days old. This event echoes a similar, widely publicized incident in 2018 involving another orca, Tahlequah, highlighting the severe challenges facing the Southern Resident killer whale population.

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change he believes would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. In a social media post, he argued that the current system fosters short-sighted management compared to the long-term view of competitors like China. While the idea has been discussed before by business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors. The change could be implemented by the SEC without congressional approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has announced plans to reduce the weighting of major issuers like China and India in its widely followed GBI-EM Global Diversified emerging-market bond index. The issuer cap will be lowered from 10% to 9% in the first half of 2026, a move intended to decrease concentration risk and enhance the index's overall yield. This adjustment will redirect investor flows away from larger markets, including Indonesia and Mexico, and toward smaller nations such as Thailand, Poland, and South Africa. The bank stated the change reflects investor feedback favoring more balanced regional exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of over $3 trillion, joining Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged more than 4% on Monday, pushing its value to $3.05 trillion by the market's close. This milestone was significantly boosted by a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties, which sent shares to a record high. Despite facing increased competition in the AI space and regulatory pressures, Alphabet's stock has risen over 30% this year, demonstrating strong investor confidence in its market position and future prospects.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares to potentially lower its benchmark interest rate, this article explains how its decisions influence consumer mortgage rates. The Fed does not set mortgage rates directly; instead, its control over the short-term federal funds rate indirectly affects the broader lending environment. Fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury note yield, which reflects long-term economic outlooks and investor sentiment. While markets have already priced in an anticipated rate cut, causing mortgage rates to dip slightly, any future guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could have a more significant impact on borrowing costs.

The pair had fled to avoid having their fifth child taken into care. The judge concluded the baby likely died of hypothermia, rejecting Marten's claim she died accidentally while sleeping.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is poised to decide on a critical case, Cook v. Trump, which challenges the president's authority to fire members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.

This potential ruling carries immense economic implications, as Fed independence is widely seen as crucial for preventing politically motivated decisions that could lead to long-term instability, such as high inflation.
