          <p>U.S. wholesale prices surged by 0.9% in July, significantly surpassing the anticipated 0.2% increase, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report. This unexpected rise in the Producer Price Index (PPI), driven largely by a 1.1% increase in services inflation, complicates the Federal Reserve's decision-making regarding potential interest rate cuts in September. The annual PPI also climbed to 3.3%, well above the Fed's 2% inflation target, leading to a drop in stock market futures and an increase in shorter-duration Treasury yields. This data provides crucial insight into pipeline prices, influencing the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's primary inflation gauge, to be updated later this month.

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American fugitive who faked his death and fled to Scotland, has been found guilty of sexual assault in the United States following a three-day trial. The conviction stems from an attack in Salt Lake County, with an additional sexual assault trial scheduled for September in Utah County. Jurors deliberated for over eight hours before delivering the verdict, and Rossi now faces a sentence of five years to life in prison on October 20. This case underscores the victim's bravery in coming forward years after the attack and the lengthy international efforts required to extradite and hold the defendant accountable for his actions.</p>

          <p>Four years after the US withdrawal, the Taliban maintain a firm hold on Afghanistan, prompting some governments, including Germany, to quietly build ties with the de-facto regime, with Russia officially recognizing them in July. Despite this shifting engagement, human rights groups criticize deportations from Europe, citing international law violations due to the danger of inhumane treatment. The regime faces immense challenges from mass deportations by neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis where nearly 23 million people, roughly half the population, rely on shrinking foreign aid. This complex situation highlights the Taliban's consolidation of power amidst ongoing human rights concerns and a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>China has launched a new "young talent" K visa category for science and technology specialists, effective October 1, as part of its strategic push for technological innovation and self-reliance. This initiative aims to bolster Beijing's ambition to become a tech superpower by 2035, attracting researchers from Asia and Africa, and encouraging top-tier Chinese scientists abroad to return. Chinese universities are also offering competitive salaries and bonuses to draw foreign researchers, recognizing skills as essential in its rivalry with the United States. The move underscores China's proactive and strategic focus on talent acquisition and development to drive its digital economy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has voiced concerns that the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska will achieve little if Ukraine is excluded from peace talks, warning that decisions made without Kyiv's input would be "stillborn." Ukrainian officials fear the leaders might dictate their nation's future without its participation, likening the situation to the 1938 Munich Agreement. Key contentious issues include territorial concessions, Ukraine's NATO ambitions, and limits on its military. Despite these fears, recent discussions with Trump and European leaders provided some consensus on Ukrainian demands for binding security guarantees, highlighting the complex diplomatic landscape.</p>

His stance aligns directionally with President Trump's repeated calls for easing monetary policy. Sumerlin emphasized the importance of Fed independence while acknowledging the need for synchronization with the administration's economic goals, indicating a pragmatic approach to the role.

Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump's characterizations "hyperbolic," noting that perception of crime often diverges from reality, especially along partisan lines.

          <p>Hundreds of retired Israeli Air Force pilots, forming the group "555," protested outside the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv against the ongoing war in Gaza and the government's decision to expand operations into Gaza City. Former military chief Dan Halutz questioned Hamas's strategic threat and accused the government of lacking legitimacy for a war opposed by much of the public. Pilots expressed moral dilemmas regarding civilian casualties and called for the release of hostages. This significant dissent from a highly respected military group adds to growing internal pressure on the government, highlighting deep divisions.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has demanded that Hunter Biden retract comments made in an interview linking her to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, threatening legal action if he fails to comply. Biden alleged that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim attributed to author Michael Wolff, which the former First Lady's lawyer calls "false, defamatory and extremely salacious." The Trumps maintain they were introduced by a modeling agent in 1998. This legal threat echoes Donald Trump's past use of litigation against critics, highlighting ongoing political and personal controversies within prominent American families.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to seek "long-term" federal control over Washington, D.C.'s police force, following his recent deployment of National Guard troops to the city. Citing a public safety emergency, Trump aims to extend his temporary 30-day authority over the department beyond its initial expiration, potentially requiring Congressional approval. Despite local officials reporting a decline in violent crime, Trump insists on a crackdown to make the capital "crime-free." This move signals a continued federal intervention into local law enforcement, sparking debate over jurisdiction and the true state of crime in the city, and its potential implications.</p>

Hunter Bell, who has a strong history in the 800m, has even sought advice from Dame Kelly Holmes, who achieved a similar double at the 2004 Olympics.

          <p>The Monterey Car Week auctions, a major event for classic car collectors, are projected to see tepid sales between $367 million and $409 million, marking a third year of decline from 2022's peak. The high end of the market is particularly weak, with only one car priced over $10 million, the fewest in over a decade. Experts attribute this slowdown to a generational shift, as Baby Boomers downsize and younger collectors prefer newer, more affordable, and practical post-1980s supercars. This trend is driving more sales to the private market to avoid public price discounts and reflect evolving tastes.</p>

In contrast, Impossible Foods maintains a "meaty" approach, focusing on taste and replicating conventional meat.

The special issue, intended to examine education related to Palestine amidst the Gaza war, was abruptly halted after the publisher sought legal review due to "antisemitism claims." Critics argue this decision undermines academic freedom and is part of a "Palestine exception" to scholarly inquiry.
