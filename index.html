          <p>Tesla reported a 13% drop in first-quarter vehicle deliveries compared to the previous year, reaching 336,681 units. This figure fell below analysts' predictions of 360,000 to 370,000 deliveries, causing initial stock dips.  The news follows Tesla's worst quarter since 2022, although shares later rebounded slightly.  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described the results as a 'fork in the road moment' for the company.</p>
