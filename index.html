        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge is investigating whether the Trump administration violated an order barring deportations of migrants to countries other than their own without sufficient chance to contest their removal. Judge Brian Murphy ordered the government to "maintain custody and control" of anyone deported to South Sudan covered under a lawsuit challenging the administration's practice of deporting migrants to third countries. Lawyers believed one man was removed from Texas to South Sudan, while a Justice Department lawyer said he was deported to Myanmar, not South Sudan. The judge warned that officials who carried out deportations in violation of his earlier order could face criminal contempt proceedings. The U.S. State Department advises American travelers not to visit South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict. </p>

          <p>The European Union is providing ‚Ç¨5.5 million to support Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after the broadcaster lost US public funding. The Trump administration suspended funding to the 75-year-old broadcaster in March, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with liberal bias. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc is releasing the emergency funding as a "safety net for independent journalism." The funds will focus on countries in regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus. Kallas spoke about tuning in to Radio Free Europe during her childhood in Estonia, part of the former Soviet Union, and how it was a beacon of democracy.</p>

The senator expressed regret for voting for Rubio, stating that he believed Rubio would stand up for principles like defending democracy and human rights, but he has done the opposite.

The final memo still contradicts a key claim that Mr. Trump made to justify sending people accused of being members of the gang to a notorious Salvadoran prison without due process.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio clashed with his former Senate Democratic colleagues, calling their criticism evidence of his success. At a hearing on the State Department budget, several Democrats said they were deeply disappointed in Mr. Rubio and regretted voting for his confirmation. The contentious scene reflected Democratic fury over President Trump‚Äôs policies, such as the evisceration of U.S. foreign aid programs. Senator Chris Van Hollen told Mr. Rubio that he regretted voting for him, to which Rubio retorted that the regret "confirms I'm doing a good job."</p>
