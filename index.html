          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested in West Hollywood's Rainbow District during an operation initially feared to be an ICE raid due to unmarked vehicles and social media warnings. Los Angeles County Sheriff officials later confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved. The operation, conducted by local law enforcement, targeted pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activities in the area, including at local establishments and among unpermitted street vendors. This clarification aimed to allay community fears regarding federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Several thieves, disguised as construction workers, executed a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value" from the Napoleon collection. The perpetrators used a freight elevator and angle grinders to access and smash display cases before fleeing on motorcycles. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed the stolen items would be recovered, emphasizing the attack on national heritage. Investigations are underway, with experts noting the high security of the Louvre and the immediate need to recover the pieces before they are dismantled.</p>

Analysts project China's GDP growth to have slowed to 4.8% from 5.2% in the previous quarter, with retail sales and industrial production also expected to ease. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix saw significant early rises, while South Korea's Kospi also climbed after hitting a record high last Friday. The article notes that U.S. markets closed higher on Friday, influenced by a softening U.S. stance on trade talks with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quarterback Bo Nix orchestrated a remarkable 19-point fourth-quarter comeback, leading the Denver Broncos to a thrilling 33-32 victory against the New York Giants. Nix accounted for four touchdowns, two passing and two rushing, including the game-winning 18-yard scramble and a subsequent drive to set up a field goal. The Giants had dominated for much of the game, but Denver's offense ignited in the final quarter, capitalizing on a crucial interception. This dramatic turnaround improved the Broncos' season record to 5-2, while the Giants fell to 2-5.</p>

          <p>A live artillery shell prematurely exploded during a Marine Corps live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton, scattering shrapnel onto Interstate 5 and damaging a California Highway Patrol vehicle and a motorcycle. The incident, part of a 250th-anniversary celebration attended by Vice President JD Vance, led to the cancellation of the exercise and significant traffic delays due to the freeway closure. Governor Gavin Newsom had previously criticized the "absurd show of force" over a busy highway, highlighting a political dispute over public safety and military exercises. An investigation into the incident is currently underway.</p>

          <p>Retirees can expect a monthly increase in Social Security benefits in 2026 due to the Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA), but this boost is tied to rising inflation, which often outpaces benefit increases. Historically, Social Security benefits have lost significant purchasing power against inflation, with a 20% decline between 2010 and 2024. Additionally, projected Medicare Part B premium surges are expected to consume a large portion of the COLA raise for many, complicating retirees' financial planning.

          <p>China's upcoming Five Year Plan (2026-2030) is poised to further reshape the global economy, building on a history of impactful strategic planning. Past plans, like Deng Xiaoping's "reform and opening up" in the 1980s, transformed China into an economic powerhouse but also led to "the China shock" of outsourced manufacturing. More recently, the focus on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology (EVs, solar panels) has given China a near monopoly on critical supply chains, raising geopolitical concerns. The current emphasis on "high quality development" aims for technological dominance, sparking trade tensions and bans on Chinese tech globally.</p>

          <p>The US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears to have weathered its first major test, despite an initial violation that killed two Israeli soldiers and prompted retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza. Both sides have since reaffirmed their commitment to the deal, with Israel announcing "renewed enforcement" of the ceasefire and the continuation of aid deliveries. Key US envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are expected in the region to implement the next phase of the agreement.
