          <p>An Ohio couple has given birth to a baby boy from an embryo that was frozen for nearly 31 years, believed to be the longest storage time to result in a live birth. The process, known as embryo adoption, involved an embryo donated in 1994 by a woman who could not use it herself. This event highlights the growing practice of donating unused embryos from IVF treatments, a topic that has gained attention amid debates over the legal status of frozen embryos. The birth sets a new record, surpassing a previous one involving a 30-year-old embryo.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has found Tesla partially liable in a wrongful death lawsuit, ordering the company to pay $200 million in punitive damages and approximately $43 million in compensatory damages. The case involved a 2019 crash where a driver using Tesla's Autopilot system ran through an intersection, killing 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injuring her boyfriend. The verdict suggests the jury believed that defects in the self-driving technology were a significant factor in the tragedy, not just driver error. Tesla has disputed the ruling and stated its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>Tourism in Las Vegas has seen a sharp decline, with visitor numbers in June dropping over 11% compared to the previous year. This downturn is affecting the hotel industry, with occupancy rates and average room prices both falling. Visitors and social media users have pointed to rising costs and a perception of empty casinos as reasons for the decline, turning a once-bustling destination into a less attractive option for many. In response to the high prices, travel experts suggest visiting during weekdays or considering alternative destinations for better value.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell 8% despite reporting second-quarter results that beat expectations for revenue and profits. Investors were concerned by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and slower growth in its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which grew 18% compared to stronger gains from rivals. The company also announced increased capital spending, largely for AI infrastructure, raising questions about when these investments will translate into profit. Despite these concerns, Amazon showed strong retail growth and a positive revenue forecast, suggesting consumer demand remains healthy amid trade tariff uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While interest rates on savings vehicles like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain high, they have decreased compared to the peak levels of the previous year. For example, a $10,000 deposit in a 2-year CD opened in 2024 with a 5.72% rate would earn significantly more than one opened now at a 4.10% rate. The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady ensures that CD rates will stay elevated for the time being. Despite the lower returns compared to last year, CDs are still presented as a potentially favorable option over traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the release of a jobs report showing a significant slowdown in hiring, President Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The July report indicated the U.S. added only 73,000 jobs and included major downward revisions for May and June, suggesting a weaker labor market than previously thought. In a social media post, Trump made a baseless accusation that the long-serving public official had "faked" the statistics. The move has alarmed economists, who view it as an attempt to bend economic data to political will, undermining the independence of federal statistical agencies.</p>

          <p>Citing several reasons for caution, CNBC's Investing Club with Jim Cramer stated it would not be buying stocks during Friday's market downturn. The primary concerns include the weak monthly jobs report and its significant downward revisions, which signal potential economic trouble. Additionally, the club pointed to the unclear impact of newly announced trade tariffs and signs of market "froth," exemplified by the extreme first-day stock increase of the company Figma. The club is maintaining a large cash position, planning to wait for greater market clarity before investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been moved from a low-security facility in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. The transfer occurred days after Maxwell met with the Deputy Attorney General. The move was condemned by several of Epstein's victims and the family of Virginia Giuffre, who called it preferential treatment and a "cover up." The transfer to the less restrictive facility has intensified scrutiny of the Justice Department's handling of the case and its outcomes for victims.</p>

          <p>For homeowners aged 70, a reverse mortgage can be a compelling option to tap into home equity for retirement income, especially with recent changes in the market. The Federal Housing Administration has increased the maximum claim amount for these loans in 2025, and borrowers at this age qualify for higher payout ratios than younger retirees. For example, a 70-year-old with a $500,000 home could potentially access a gross principal limit of around $205,000. The article advises that choosing the right payout option and comparing lender fees are key strategies to maximize benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

This hiring spree is part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand immigration enforcement, aiming to recruit 10,000 new personnel to help meet a target of one million deportations per year.

The university chancellor stated the move defunds "life-saving research" and is a loss for the nation. The action follows a Department of Justice investigation that found UCLA's response to pro-Palestinian campus protests was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students."

This move is seen as part of a broader pullback from DEI commitments by Google, influenced by cost-cutting, a focus on AI, and the shifting political landscape.

The visit to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site, operated by U.S. contractors within an Israeli military zone, has been criticized as a "media stunt" by some Gazans. The GHF system is contentious, with the UN reporting hundreds of Palestinians killed near its distribution points, a figure the GHF disputes.
