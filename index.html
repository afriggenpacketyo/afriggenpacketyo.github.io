          <p>House Republican leaders are trying to unite GOP lawmakers behind a plan to enact President Trump's agenda, following Senate passage of a budget resolution. The Senate version, calling for at least $4 billion in spending cuts, differs from the House's $1.5-2 trillion mandate, causing concern among some House conservatives. House GOP leaders insist the Senate's action allows them to proceed with their version, aiming for historic spending reductions while protecting essential programs. The goal is to have a bill on Trump's desk by May, but disagreements persist over spending cut levels and enforcement mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The article examines the trend of optimized morning routines promoted by fitness influencers, particularly Ashton Hall, and its connection to modern masculinity. Hall's viral routine, featuring extreme discipline and early wake-up times, has sparked debate about its implications. While seemingly harmless, the content reflects a shift in the manosphere, promoting regressive ideas about gender roles. The author argues that this subtle lean towards patriarchy can be more dangerous than overtly misogynistic content, as it normalizes unequal gender dynamics under the guise of self-improvement.</p>

          <p>Economists are questioning the formula behind President Trump's proposed tariffs, arguing it's based on flawed assumptions. The formula uses a lower elasticity rate than is accurate, leading to inflated tariff rates. If adjusted, the tariffs would be much lower, with most nations only subject to the baseline rate. A report from the Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than they are in practice, further undermining the rationale for the policy.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are requesting a sentence of over seven years for former Congressman George Santos, citing a "brazen web of deceit." Santos is accused of defrauding donors, misleading voters, and fabricating campaign finance filings to bolster his political career. The schemes involved falsifying donor contributions, laundering money through a fraudulent consulting firm, and falsely reporting a $500,000 personal loan. Santos has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity fraud, while his defense argues for a lighter sentence of no more than two years, claiming he has accepted responsibility.</p>

          <p>While global leaders reacted to President Trump's tariffs, Argentinian President Javier Milei reaffirmed his support for Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Milei, who has implemented austerity measures in Argentina, presented himself as a strong ally against the "woke" left. Despite the tariffs, Argentina's government framed its relationship with the U.S. as uniquely preferential. Milei is also seeking a $20 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, with the U.S. being a key stakeholder.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's tariff announcement has created uncertainty among global leaders and prompted concerns about the economic impact. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed the potential consequences of the tariffs, with David Leonhardt noting that trade has not delivered benefits to all Americans. While adjustments to trade policy may be needed, Trump's approach is considered "shambolic" and unpredictable. The tariffs' impact on financial markets and the overall economy remains a key concern.</p>

          <p>The bankruptcy of 23andMe has raised concerns about the privacy of users' genetic data, as the company seeks to sell its assets, including genomic information.

Experts advise users to delete their data and revoke permissions to protect their privacy.

          <p>The Trump administration is arguing that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the return of a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was deported despite a previous ruling protecting him from deportation. Government lawyers claim that compelling the executive branch to engage with a foreign power is unconstitutional. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that the government has failed to take action to rectify the error, despite acknowledging it.</p>

          <p>Cosmetic surgery in the UK is on the rise, driven by procedures like body contouring and anti-wrinkle treatments. While breast augmentation remains the most popular procedure, there is growing demand for facial rejuvenation and body sculpting.
