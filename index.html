          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Blake Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and others in a legal feud that began in December 2024. The judge dismissed Baldoni's defamation claim against The New York Times, stating the Times reviewed available evidence and reported what it believed happened, lacking obvious motive to favor Lively. Lively's lawyers called the dismissal a victory and plan to seek attorneys' fees, treble damages, and punitive damages against Baldoni. The initial complaint filed by Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of their film, which Baldoni denied, leading to the countersuit alleging a false narrative and smear campaign. </p>

          <p>The increasing demand for critical minerals like lithium, copper, and cobalt is vital for clean energy technologies, including solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. A UN Secretary-General highlighted the opportunity for developing countries to create jobs and diversify economies through these minerals if managed properly. The US is a major consumer but not a significant producer, leading to government efforts to increase domestic production and build a strategic mineral stockpile. As the demand for clean energy expands, scientists are exploring alternative materials and more efficient mining methods to mitigate supply constraints and environmental burdens, as lithium use is projected to increase drastically by 2040. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom escalated their conflict over protests in Los Angeles concerning federal immigration policies. Trump stated he would arrest Newsom if he were "border czar" Tom Homan, a statement Newsom decried as a step toward authoritarianism. Homan clarified that while no one is above the law, there were no specific discussions about arresting Newsom. Trump also reinforced his decision to deploy the National Guard to California, despite Newsom's objections, amidst ongoing demonstrations against immigration enforcement.</p>

They claim the company has a history of reducing Medicaid access to increase profits, citing reports of backlogs, delays, and fraud. Maximus, which has spent over $2 million lobbying, stated its objectives align with cost-cutting initiatives and that it delivers on policies enacted by both parties.

          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize the California National Guard due to protests against federal immigration authorities is a concerning use of military power against demonstrators. While federal law allows the president to federalize a state's National Guard under specific conditions, such as invasion or rebellion, it's questionable whether the protests meet this threshold. The Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the military from domestic use, but the Insurrection Act could be invoked, granting broad presidential powers. The author argues that the protests do not warrant federal intervention and that Trump's actions are a frightening signal about the willingness to suppress demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Families of missing Ukrainian soldiers gathered near the Belarus border as a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine took place. Relatives, desperate for information, brandished photos of missing loved ones, hoping for any news after years of waiting. The exchange, agreed upon during talks in Turkey, involved sick and wounded prisoners, those under 25, and the bodies of 12,000 soldiers. President Zelensky said the process would unfold in stages, while Russia's defense ministry confirmed the return of Russian servicemen under 25, with both sides refraining from providing exact figures.</p>

Rhianan, who took her own life in May 2022, had been investigated by MI5 after downloading a bomb-making manual, but the charges were dropped after the Home Office determined she was a victim of exploitation. The inquest found no organization was to blame for her death, but identified failures in providing mental health support.</p>
