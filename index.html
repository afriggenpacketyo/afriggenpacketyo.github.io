          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite Plunging Shipments to the U.S. Amid Tariff War</h2>

          <p>China's exports defied expectations with an 8.1% surge in April, even as shipments to the U.S. plummeted by over 21% due to tariffs. Imports saw a slight decline of 0.2%, indicating Beijing's efforts to stimulate domestic demand. The export surge may be attributed to transshipments and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced, but experts anticipate a gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months. China is attempting to mitigate the impact of tariffs by diverting sales to its domestic market, which could lead to deflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, a move condemned by top Democrats as an assault on American values. Hayden, the first woman in the role, was informed via email, prompting outrage from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and others who lauded her service and commitment to freedom. Trump is expected to announce her replacement soon, while lawmakers plan to introduce legislation to ensure congressional appointment of future librarians, following what they describe as an unprecedented and unjust decision by the Trump administration. This action sparks concerns about the erosion of public trust in institutions and the safeguarding of intellectual legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the framework of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K., aiming to boost trade and create jobs. While the 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, the agreement includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products and reduced non-tariff barriers. The deal, described as a win for both countries, allows the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers to be subject to the 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing higher rates. Rolls Royce engines will be exempt from tariffs, and a British airline will purchase $10 billion in Boeing planes.</p>

Kim emphasized the need to enhance the role of nuclear forces in deterring and fighting a war, accusing the U.S. and its allies of escalating tensions through nuclear operation drills near the Korean Peninsula.

          <p>A grand jury investigation into the Hanceville Police Department in Alabama revealed a "rampant culture of corruption," leading to the dismissal of nearly 60 felony cases. The investigation found that several officers and the police chief were indicted for mishandling or removing evidence from the department's evidence room. An audit revealed significant discrepancies in documented evidence, including missing firearms, cash, and illicit drugs. In response, the town's mayor placed the entire department on leave and later announced it would be disbanded and rebuilt from scratch.</p>

          <p>According to a mines developer, developed nations are seeking to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on the metal. Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list in February as retaliation against U.S. tariffs, causing panic in the industry reliant on Chinese raw materials for three decades. U.S. defense contractors also face a looming challenge to cease using Chinese tungsten by 2027. China accounts for over 80% of global raw tungsten ore mined, and the element is used in cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy applications.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being removed as part of an investigation into the Eaton fire, was damaged when it contacted power lines during a helicopter lift. No injuries were reported, but the extent of the damage and its impact on the investigation are still being assessed. The tower was being transported to a warehouse for testing, as investigators explore induction as a possible cause of the fire. This incident occurred after the successful removal of another tower from the suspected ignition point.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and U.K. have announced a trade deal, but analysts suggest its substantive benefits are limited, with the 10% import tax on most U.K. goods remaining intact. The agreement primarily involves walking back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel in exchange for expanded access for American agricultural products. Critics argue the deal is more about political optics than significant economic changes, with Trump eager to declare victory. The announcement has drawn sharp rebukes from American carmakers and skepticism from farm groups.</p>

The proposal coincides with the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII and President Xi Jinping's attendance at a Victory Day parade in Moscow.
