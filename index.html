          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced the imposition of anti-dumping tariffs on brandy imported from the European Union, a move primarily affecting French cognac producers. The tariffs, ranging from 27.7% to 34.9%, will be effective for five years starting Saturday. The ministry stated that its investigation found that dumping practices posed a material threat of injury to China's domestic brandy industry. This decision was revealed just as China's Foreign Minister began a visit to Paris, highlighting ongoing trade tensions between the two economic powers (not investment advice).</p>

Ideas range from celebrating the UK's maritime heritage and famous landmarks to featuring classic TV characters and vintage trains.

The public consultation reflects a broad desire for the new currency to represent the entire nation's culture, history, and natural beauty.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, faced one of its most intensive aerial attacks as Russia launched a record 550 drones and 11 missiles overnight. The bombardment, which hit nearly every district, occurred just hours after a phone call between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, during which Trump expressed disappointment over the lack of progress toward ending the war. Ukrainian officials condemned the timing of the attack as a deliberate show of disregard from Putin. The strikes caused numerous injuries and significant damage to infrastructure, intensifying as ceasefire talks remain stalled.</p>

          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs has reported that the UK Home Office does not know if foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee found that the department has failed to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020. With 1.18 million people applying through this route, the committee criticized the Home Office for its lack of curiosity and slow response to worker exploitation. The government acknowledged inheriting a "broken system" and pledged to implement stronger measures, including biometric checks.</p>

          <p>The 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are facing potential politicization by the Trump administration, which could leverage the event's security apparatus for aggressive immigration enforcement. The designation of the games as a National Special Security Event (NSSE) grants federal agencies, including ICE, broad latitude, raising concerns for LA's large undocumented population. Critics worry that President Trump may use the event to target political rivals like California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass by threatening federal funding and intensifying ICE raids.

          <p>President Donald Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has passed Congress, marking a major legislative victory for his administration. The bill combines tax cuts, increased defense and immigration spending, and a rollback of clean energy initiatives, but is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt. While Trump and his supporters celebrate it as fulfilling campaign promises, critics and Democrats decry the deep cuts to health and social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The legislation is deeply divisive, with polls showing a majority of Americans oppose it.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered a dominant performance, pitching into the eighth inning for the first time in his career to lead his team to a 6-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox.

In this outing, he took a perfect game into the sixth inning and a shutout into the eighth, providing much-needed stability. The win marked the Dodgers' fourth consecutive victory.</p>

          <p>An Oregon jury has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault and other related charges stemming from an incident in 2021. The case involved a 21-year-old woman who prosecutors argued was incapacitated and unable to consent during a party at a teammate's house. The defense contended the encounter was consensual, but the jury delivered a guilty verdict on three of four counts. The local District Attorney emphasized that celebrity status does not shield individuals from prosecution for criminal acts in the county.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially become the first country in the world to formally recognize the Taliban's rule over Afghanistan, a move the Taliban's Foreign Minister called "courageous." The decision, conveyed by Russia's ambassador in Kabul, marks a significant diplomatic shift and is seen by the Taliban as an example for other nations. This formal recognition follows Russia's earlier actions to remove the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations and sign an economic deal with them in 2022. The move contrasts sharply with the stance of Western governments, who have condemned the Taliban's human rights violations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's announcement that he plans to host a large-scale UFC fight on the White House grounds for the nation's 250th anniversary has been met with widespread criticism and ridicule. The proposal, which would involve an audience of up to 25,000 spectators, was described by critics as undignified and something out of the dystopian comedy film "Idiocracy." The plan was revealed during a rally in Iowa, where Trump credited UFC CEO Dana White, a longtime friend and supporter, with organizing the event. While not the first fight at the White House, it would be the first commercial one of this scale.</p>

While Newsom's political advisors deny he is laying groundwork for a presidential run, the visit to an early primary state is seen as a significant political move.
