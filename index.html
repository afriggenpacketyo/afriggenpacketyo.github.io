          <p>A UK court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap. He was charged for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization, during a 2024 concert. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" and "null" due to a technical error in how it was brought forward by prosecutors. Supporters, including Northern Ireland's First Minister Michelle O'Neill, celebrated the decision, framing the case as a politically motivated attempt to silence criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza and a victory against political policing.</p>

          <p>An Interpol-coordinated operation across 14 African nations has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running large-scale romance and "sextortion" scams. The sting, funded by the UK, targeted criminal networks that used digital platforms to defraud over 1,400 victims out of an estimated $2.8 million. During the crackdown, authorities seized numerous devices, forged documents, and dismantled 81 cyber-crime groups. The operation highlights the rising threat of digital-enabled crimes in Africa, which cause significant financial and psychological harm to a wide range of victims, including the elderly.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris recounts her frustration following Joe Biden's difficult debate performance against Donald Trump in June 2024. She reveals she angrily rejected campaign-issued talking points that declared Biden the winner, throwing the paper on the table and refusing to be fed "bulls--t." The book describes the debate as a disaster, citing Biden's verbal stumbles and a particularly damaging line about having "beat Medicare." Harris explains she chose to pivot her post-debate media interviews to focus on Trump's falsehoods rather than attempt to defend Biden's widely criticized performance.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, particularly with the United States, Beijing has developed a range of policy measures to protect its domestic industries and respond to foreign pressures. This article outlines key tools in China's economic arsenal, such as the "Unreliable Entity List," which can restrict trade and investment with foreign firms deemed harmful to China's interests. Another significant measure involves new export controls on dual-use items, which are goods with both civilian and potential military applications, requiring shipment approvals. These strategies allow China to retaliate against what it considers unfair trade practices and safeguard its national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody has reached at least 16 since January, raising serious concerns among lawmakers and advocacy groups. This figure marks a significant increase in the monthly death rate compared to the previous administration, occurring alongside a record-high detainee population that surpassed 60,000 in August.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the impending sale of TikTok's U.S. assets to a group of American investors, including billionaires Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, exacerbates the trend of media ownership by the ultra-rich. This concentration of power in the hands of a few wealthy individuals, who also control outlets like Fox News and have influence over CNN and The Washington Post, is presented as a threat to independent journalism. The author expresses concern that such ownership encourages self-censorship and prioritizes the owners' financial and political interests over unbiased reporting, with control of TikTok's influential algorithm being a key point of concern.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral primary winner Zohran Mamdani is championing a plan to create a network of city-owned grocery stores aimed at providing affordable food by operating on a non-profit basis. While the proposal has found support among many likely voters, it faces strong criticism from established industry figures who argue it is unrealistic and ignores the complexities of the grocery business. The article notes that similar experiments with municipal grocery stores across the U.S. have had mixed results, highlighting both a successful example in a small Kansas town and another nearby that failed financially.

          <p>A legal analysis suggests the Trump administration's prosecution of Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) represents a concerning test of authoritarian tactics and executive power. McIver faces felony charges for allegedly "forcibly" interfering with federal officers during the arrest of another Democratic official, though video evidence reportedly shows minimal contact. The article argues that even if she is acquitted, the case forces her to expend significant personal or campaign funds on legal defense, potentially setting a precedent for using the justice system to financially drain political opponents.

This plan is modeled on past international administrations in East Timor and Kosovo and comes as various parties table different proposals for Gaza's future governance.

While Trump claimed to have received a "go ahead" from President Xi Jinping, China's official statements have been more measured, emphasizing compliance with its own laws.

The company has significantly ramped up production, now making around 30 million plush toys monthly to meet demand and counter scalpers.

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security career expo in Provo, Utah, drew a wide range of applicants interested in joining Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies. The event is part of the Trump administration's push to hire 10,000 new ICE personnel to help achieve its goal of deporting one million people a year. Attendees included military veterans, current law enforcement officers, recent graduates, and even some federal workers who were previously laid off. Motivations varied, with some expressing strong support for the administration's immigration policies, while others viewed it simply as a stable federal job with good benefits.</p>

          <h2>Trump's TikTok Deal Payment Criticized as 'Shake-Down Scheme'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's demand for a multibillion-dollar payment to the federal government as part of the TikTok deal is being criticized by some financial experts as a "shake-down scheme" and a form of "crony capitalism." The group of U.S. investors taking over the app's operations, which includes Trump allies, reportedly agreed to the payment, viewing it as a "finders' fee." Critics argue this sets a dangerous precedent, where the government extracts fees for brokering private business deals, potentially distorting free-market principles. This action is seen as part of a broader pattern of the administration intervening in private business to reward allies and exert personal power.</p>

          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com has initiated a share buyback program for its employees, establishing a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its peak valuation of $40 billion during a 2022 funding round, reflecting a broader correction in the tech sector. The company, which competes with payment giants like Stripe and Adyen, says it is on track for strong revenue growth this year. The move to buy back shares provides a path to liquidity for employees at a time when many tech startups are delaying initial public offerings.</p>

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the starter relay can corrode, leading to overheating and a short circuit.

Trump stated the tariffs are necessary to protect American manufacturers from being flooded by foreign products. The move has raised concerns among U.S. business groups and international trading partners, such as the UK and Ireland, which are major pharmaceutical exporters to the United States.

          <p>Outdoor apparel brand Arc'teryx is facing a significant public relations crisis after a marketing campaign involving a large fireworks display in the Himalayas drew widespread condemnation.

The backlash intensified after reports of debris left on the mountain slopes, and the local government has launched an investigation.

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has stated that his country will continue to purchase fossil fuels from Russia, despite a recent demand from U.S. President Donald Trump for all NATO allies to do so. Orbán said he informed Trump that cutting off Russian energy would be an economic "disaster" for Hungary, causing its economic performance to drop by 4%. While most of the EU has worked to wean itself off Russian energy since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Hungary has maintained close ties with Moscow, citing infrastructural constraints. Orbán asserted that Hungary is a sovereign country that will act in its own national interest.</p>

The tournament, co-hosted with Canada and Mexico, is scheduled to feature games in 11 American cities, including several Democratic-run municipalities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. While FIFA is officially in charge of tournament organization and city selection, Trump claimed he has the authority to make such changes to ensure safety. The statement aligns with his administration's focus on crime and its willingness to deploy federal resources to cities led by political opponents.</p>

The IOPC is investigating Leicestershire Police's prior contact with the killer, Valdo Calocane.

Data from the first half of 2025 shows a noticeable decrease in the share of Chinese-built ships on routes to both the west and east coasts of North America. The move suggests that global shipping lines are proactively adjusting their operations to mitigate the financial impact of escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
