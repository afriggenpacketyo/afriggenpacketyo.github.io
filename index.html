          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the race to succeed him. At a joint appearance, Adams framed the endorsement as a necessary move to unify against Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, whom he called an "existential threat" to the city. Cuomo echoed this sentiment, stating that Mamdani's platform is disconnected from the Democratic party's values. The endorsement aims to consolidate support for Cuomo, who is polling competitively against Mamdani in the upcoming general election.</p>

          <p>New satellite images confirm the complete demolition of the White House East Wing to accommodate a new $300 million ballroom project initiated by President Trump. The White House Press Secretary defended the move, stating that architects advised demolition was necessary for a modern and stable structure, despite initial promises that the project would not affect the existing building. The administration claims the project is privately funded by the president and other donors, and argues it did not require external approval for demolition, only for new vertical construction.</p>

          <p>Maia Kobabe’s award-winning graphic memoir, “Gender Queer,” one of the most banned books in the U.S., will be released in a new annotated edition next year. The book chronicles Kobabe's journey of self-discovery with gender and sexuality, and has been a frequent target of conservative-led book challenges. This special hardcover edition will include new commentary from Kobabe, as well as contributions from other comic creators and scholars, offering deeper context on its themes. The author hopes the new edition provides a richer text for readers in a political climate increasingly hostile to LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>The union Starbucks Workers United is initiating a strike authorization vote as it seeks to secure its first contract with the coffee giant. The vote comes after negotiations stalled, with the union demanding better staffing hours, increased pay, and resolution for hundreds of unfair labor practice charges. If approved, the union, which represents over 12,000 workers, could call an open-ended national strike. Starbucks maintains that it offers competitive pay and benefits and stated it is ready to resume talks if the union returns to the bargaining table.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is intensely focused on the upcoming September consumer price index (CPI) report, as the ongoing government shutdown has halted the release of most other official economic data. Economists expect the headline inflation rate to be around 3.1%, a slight increase from the previous month. Because of the lack of other economic indicators, any significant deviation from this forecast could cause an outsized market reaction. The report is also critical for the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to approve another interest rate cut at its next policy meeting.</p>

Economists attribute the uptick in inflation partly to tariffs, which have led companies to pass costs to consumers.

          <p>Parenting toddlers often involves navigating a series of confusing behaviors, such as constant defiance, possessiveness, and a desire to explore everything physically. According to pediatric psychologists, these actions are developmentally appropriate ways for young children to establish their identity and understand their environment. Saying "no" to everything, for instance, is a method of testing boundaries and asserting newfound independence. Experts advise parents to reframe this behavior as a learning process and respond with calm, firm guidance rather than frustration, offering choices to give toddlers a sense of agency.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to pardon Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has drawn sharp criticism, notably from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who labeled the act as "corruption." Zhao had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and served a four-month sentence. The White House justified the pardon by claiming Zhao was unfairly targeted by the Biden administration's "war on crypto." Warren pointed out that Zhao's pardon followed reports of his company's involvement with a Trump family crypto venture, suggesting a quid pro quo that undermines the justice system and damages the nation's reputation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has voiced concerns about the safety implications of air traffic controllers taking on second jobs to make ends meet during the government shutdown. As essential employees, controllers are required to work without pay, forcing many to drive for services like Uber and DoorDash after long shifts. Duffy stated he wants controllers focused on their single, high-stress job and warned that staffing shortages could lead to more flight delays and cancellations. The shutdown is causing significant strain on personnel responsible for managing the nation's airspace.</p>

The mayor's staff allegedly instructed the fire department to issue a statement implying corruption, which Escobar argues was a direct response to his protected union activity and his constitutional right to free speech.</p>
