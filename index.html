          <p>A British court has sentenced aristocrat Constance Marten and her partner, Mark Gordon, to 14 years in prison each for the manslaughter of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run to prevent the baby from being taken into care, living in a tent during freezing winter conditions where the infant ultimately died from what the judge determined was likely hypothermia. The judge described the case as "neglect of the gravest and most serious type," noting the pair showed no genuine remorse. The article also provides context on Marten's estrangement from her wealthy family and Gordon's previous conviction for a violent sexual assault in the United States.</p>

          <p>The coffin of Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, who passed away at age 92, has been brought to Westminster Cathedral in London for her funeral service. Draped in the royal standard, the coffin was transported from Kensington Palace and received in a private family service, a tradition in the Roman Catholic faith. King Charles and Queen Camilla, along with other senior royals, are expected to attend the Requiem Mass, which marks the first Catholic funeral for a modern British Royal Family member. The duchess was remembered for her public service, love of music, and as a familiar presence at the Wimbledon tennis championships.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule imminently on whether the president has the authority to fire members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors at will. The case, Cook v. Trump, stems from the president's attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, a move that challenges the Fed's long-standing independence from direct political control. Legal experts warn that a ruling in favor of the president, based on the "unitary executive" theory, could have disastrous consequences for the U.S. economy by allowing a president to manipulate interest rates for short-term political gain. This could risk long-term inflation and economic instability, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has announced that DNA evidence directly links 22-year-old Tyler Robinson to the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. According to Patel, DNA from a towel wrapped around the rifle and a screwdriver found at the scene matched Robinson's profile. Investigators also recovered forensic evidence of a destroyed note in which the suspect allegedly wrote about his opportunity and intent to kill Kirk. Robinson, who turned himself in after being identified by a relative, is reportedly not cooperating with authorities, but officials are gathering information from his family and friends to understand his motives.</p>

          <p>Two separate sailing crews, totaling nine people, were rescued off the coast of Portugal after their vessels were attacked by orcas. The incidents occurred near Lisbon, with one attack happening off Fonte da Telha beach and the other in the Bay of Cascais. No injuries were reported, and rescue services successfully assisted both crews, towing one of the damaged boats to a nearby port.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that Washington and Beijing have reached a "framework" agreement regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, potentially avoiding a nationwide ban. The deal, which still requires final approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping, aims to address national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. While details remain sparse, the agreement was reportedly reached during broader trade talks in Madrid. China's trade representative confirmed a framework exists but stated that no deal would be finalized at the expense of Chinese companies' interests, leaving the future of TikTok's powerful algorithm uncertain.</p>

          <p>According to FBI Co-Deputy Director Dan Bongino, the suspect in Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appeared to have an "obsession" with the conservative influencer.

Law enforcement sources also revealed that Robinson had been tracking Kirk's public appearances online and had familiarized himself with the Utah Valley University campus prior to the attack. While a specific motive has not been officially declared, authorities are investigating the extent of his fixation and whether he was part of a larger network of individuals who may have been aware of his intentions.</p>

It suggests moving funds from traditional low-yield savings accounts into alternatives like a high-rate certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in a fixed interest rate for a set term. For those who need more liquidity, a high-yield savings account or a money market account are recommended, as they offer competitive variable rates, though these are expected to fall following the Fed's actions. The central advice is to act proactively to secure better earnings while current high rates are still available. (not investment advice)</p>

Tax professionals suggest that filers, especially those who could be affected by the new tax breaks, should review their obligations to avoid potential underpayment penalties.

          <h2>Analysis of Energy Production Costs Reveals Renewables as Most Affordable Option</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows that renewable energy sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before accounting for government subsidies. According to a report from investment bank Lazard, onshore wind is the most affordable, followed by solar, while traditional sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power are significantly more expensive to generate. Experts note that while renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are very low, unlike fossil fuels which are subject to volatile fuel prices. The report highlights the economic advantages of transitioning to cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will deploy RAF Typhoon fighter jets to help defend Polish airspace as part of a broader NATO mission to bolster its eastern flank. The move comes after Poland reported an incursion of 19 Russian drones into its territory last week, an incident that has significantly heightened regional tensions. The UK's jets will join aircraft from Denmark, France, and Germany in conducting air defense missions. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated the deployment sends a clear message of unity and resolve to Moscow, describing Russia's actions as reckless and unprecedented in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nomination of his top economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to the Federal Reserve Board is facing significant controversy ahead of a Senate vote. Critics are alarmed by Miran's plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role rather than resigning, a move they argue would compromise the Fed's crucial political independence. Miran's previous writings, which advocate for shortening Fed board members' terms and making them serve at the president's will, have further fueled concerns. The nomination comes as the president has been increasingly critical of the central bank's policies and has actively sought to exert more influence over its decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated he would "never" have appointed Peter Mandelson as the ambassador to the U.S. had he known the full extent of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer's comments follow his decision to sack Lord Mandelson after emails emerged showing supportive messages sent to Epstein around the time of his 2008 conviction. The Prime Minister defended the initial due diligence process but admitted the new information revealed a relationship far different from what was understood at the time of the appointment. The scandal has added to the pressure on Starmer's government, which has recently faced other high-profile resignations.</p>

          <p>Paul Ovenden, a senior aide to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has resigned from his position as director of political strategy after offensive messages he sent eight years ago surfaced. The messages contained graphic and sexually explicit comments about veteran Member of Parliament Diane Abbott. In a statement, Ovenden apologized for the remarks and said he was resigning to avoid becoming a distraction for the government. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister called the messages "appalling and unacceptable" and praised Abbott as a trailblazer who has faced horrendous abuse throughout her career.

          <p>Across the United States, individuals aligned with the "election integrity" movement who deny the results of the 2020 election are being appointed to local election boards, raising concerns about partisan interference in future elections. In key areas like Fulton County, Georgia, and Maricopa County, Arizona, these appointments have led to legal battles and political standoffs. Local officials and voting rights advocates fear these new board members could disrupt election administration, promote disinformation, and attempt to block the certification of legitimate results. This trend represents a strategy to potentially subvert democratic processes from within the system itself, creating instability ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "A Thousand Ways to Die," Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Trymaine Lee explores the profound personal and physical toll of his career spent reporting on gun violence in America. Lee recounts how a near-fatal heart attack at age 38 forced him to confront the stress and trauma he had absorbed from years of covering the deaths of young Black men. The book combines historical context on firearms in the U.S. with his personal journey, highlighting the humanity of the victims and the systemic issues that perpetuate the violence. Lee's work serves as a powerful call to action and a reflection on the emotional burden carried by those who document tragedy.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor known for her work on high-profile cases involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, is suing the Trump administration over her termination this summer. Comey, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, alleges in her lawsuit that she was fired without cause and that the dismissal was an unlawful act of retaliation due to her father's contentious relationship with the president. The lawsuit claims her removal was unconstitutional and based on her perceived political affiliation. Her case is one of several legal challenges filed by career civil servants who have been abruptly removed from their positions by the administration.</p>
