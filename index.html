          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel is bracing for potential retaliation from Iran following its recent attack, emphasizing the need for preparedness rather than euphoria. Netanyahu said he informed the Americans in advance of the attack, asserting that Trump makes decisions independently. He justified targeting Iran's nuclear facilities as a measure for Israel's survival, revealing that he had directed the military to attack Iran after the death of a Hezbollah leader in 2024 but the attack was postponed for various reasons. Netanyahu claimed he had wanted to attack Iran twice before but lacked the necessary political support.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has denied Donald Trump's attempt to overturn a jury verdict finding him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of E. Jean Carroll. The full panel declined to hear Trump's arguments, potentially leading to a Supreme Court appeal in the years-long case stemming from Carroll's 2019 allegations of sexual assault. Trump challenged the introduction of the Access Hollywood tape as evidence, but the court upheld the verdict, finding him liable for sexual abuse and defamation, awarding Carroll $5 million, while Trump is also appealing a separate $83 million defamation verdict in another case brought by Carroll. Two Trump-appointed judges dissented, arguing the tape was inadmissible propensity evidence.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's large-scale attacks on Iran, Donald Trump faces a foreign policy crisis and a diplomatic challenge, struggling to articulate a consistent message. Initial reactions from US diplomats were reserved, emphasizing the US's non-involvement in the attack's logistics or planning. Trump's responses on Truth Social ranged from gloating to offering Iran a "second chance," while his comments to media outlets conveyed support for Israel but lacked a clear strategy. Experts suggest that Israel's actions reflect a willingness to defy American preferences, and Trump's varied statements highlight the complex dynamics between the two allies. Optimism is tempered by the potential for escalating conflict and the uncertain future of nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>Two men have been sentenced to prison for the 2019 theft of a £4.8 million gold toilet from Blenheim Palace. James Sheen, who pleaded guilty to burglary and related charges, received a four-year sentence, while Michael Jones, convicted of burglary, was sentenced to two years and three months. The heist, described as "bold and brazen," took only five-and-a-half minutes to complete, with Sheen identified as a key player who sold part of the gold. The investigation involved deciphering coded messages and tracking down forensic evidence, revealing Sheen's extensive criminal history and Jones's reconnaissance visits to Blenheim Palace.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges after being brought back to the U.S. from detention in El Salvador. The case follows a prolonged legal battle after his deportation in March, despite a 2019 court order barring deportation due to fear of persecution. Federal prosecutors allege that Garcia participated in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country. The prosecution has requested a pre-trial detention hearing, arguing Garcia's alleged MS-13 ties pose a risk of obstruction or witness intimidation, while his attorneys contend the arguments for detention are meritless.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent airstrikes on Iran targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, according to the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that 200 fighter jets struck over 100 targets, including sites in Tehran and Natanz, a key uranium enrichment location. In response, Iran launched more than 100 drones at Israel, many of which were intercepted, and the IDF claimed damage to the underground area of the Natanz site, including centrifuge infrastructure. The U.S. Secretary of State said the U.S. was not involved in the strikes, which occurred amid ongoing efforts to negotiate an agreement limiting Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers can lower their credit card interest rates without opening new accounts by employing several strategies. Calling the card issuer directly to request a lower rate is often effective, especially with a good payment history. Enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can lead to negotiated lower rates, though it typically requires closing the cards. Temporary hardship programs offered by card companies can provide reduced APRs or deferred payments during financial difficulties, and leveraging an improved credit score can also justify a rate reduction. Mentioning competitive offers from other companies can strengthen negotiating power. (not investment advice)</p>

To counter tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China, projecting a drop in receipts from 16% to 2% by the fourth quarter. The company also plans to open stores internationally, including a location on Paris' Champs Élysées, though the launch of a new concept will be delayed until spring 2026.</p>

The warm weather has created ideal conditions for birch tree pollen, a major hay fever trigger, leading to a 'pollen bomb'. Allergy experts recommend a 'cocktail approach' of antihistamine tablets, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops for relief. Additionally, avoiding hay fever triggers, practicing good hygiene, and regularly cleaning the home can help reduce symptoms, and immunotherapy treatment may be available for those severely affected.</p>

The court heard that both girls had "deeply troubled home lives" and were abused, degraded, and discarded, with one victim estimating she may have been preyed on by hundreds of men.

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, oil prices have jumped and stocks have tumbled, heightening fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East. Crude oil prices saw their largest increase since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pushing the U.S. benchmark close to $73 a barrel, which could reverse the recent downward trend in gasoline prices. Investors were rattled by the air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran's retaliatory drone launch, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling sharply in early trading. Typically, nervous traders would seek shelter in U.S. government bonds, but this did not occur, signaling lingering concerns over the high level of U.S. debt.</p>

Critics argue that Trump's leadership has been making decisions without informing or seeking the consent of the bipartisan commission that oversees America250.</p>

          <p>An Air India passenger plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, western India, killing nearly all passengers and crew, as well as people on the ground. The flight, bound for London's Gatwick airport, crashed into a residential area, striking a doctors' hostel. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the crash, with aviation experts suggesting the position of the plane's wing flaps may have played a role. The airline and authorities are cooperating with the investigation, and support is being provided to the families of the victims, while a British man was the sole survivor of the crash.</p>

The protests, organized by a grassroots organization called 50501, aim to challenge Trump's actions, which opponents view as a threat to democratic pillars. Trump's decision to deploy the military against demonstrators in LA has drawn attention to the protests, and the organizers want the focus to be on the rest of the US and their protests rather than Trump's birthday and his military parade.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated Donald Trump's control over California's national guard, hours after a judge ruled his use of the guard to suppress protests in Los Angeles was illegal. The decision pauses a temporary restraining order against Trump until an emergency hearing, with the legal battle likely to reach the US Supreme Court. A judge had previously found Trump's move to federalize the California national guard illegal, arguing he failed to show there was a "rebellion" requiring federal intervention. The lawsuit challenges Trump's move to call up national guard troops and active-duty marines over Newsom's objections.</p>
