          <p>Actress Barbara Stock, who played Liz Adams on the hit 1980s series "Dallas," shared her experience of being written off the show without prior warning. She only realized it was her last day when a crew member mentioned it in the makeup room, noting in hindsight that a scene where her character packed a suitcase should have been a clear clue. Stock expressed that while the news was heartbreaking at the time, she holds no hard feelings and has fond memories of the cast, including stars Larry Hagman and Patrick Duffy. She later transitioned from acting to a career in interior design.</p>

          <p>In an interview about his new memoir, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy shared his concerns about the current state of the nation's highest court. The 89-year-old, who served as a pivotal "swing justice," stated that some opinions from the current court have become "a little bit too personal and confrontational." Kennedy reflected on his career, his role in landmark cases like those concerning abortion rights and same-sex marriage, and his worry that a lack of civility in public discourse is endangering democracy. He emphasized the importance of rational, respectful debate for the nation's health.</p>

          <p>This article examines the expanding presence of U.S. Border Patrol agents in major cities far from the nation's borders, a key component of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement strategy. Human rights advocates and legal experts express concern that the agency, trained for border interdiction, is ill-suited for civil enforcement in urban areas and employs overly aggressive tactics. The agency operates within a "100-mile zone" from any international boundary, which includes most major cities, but its increased deployment inland is a recent shift. Critics point to incidents in Chicago and Los Angeles as examples of potential constitutional rights violations.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights the growing issue of "workslop"—AI-generated content that appears complete but lacks substance—which is reportedly harming productivity. This article argues that the responsibility for this phenomenon lies not with the AI technology itself, but with employers who fail to properly implement it. The author contends that many businesses are swayed by hype and do not invest in necessary training, policies, or strategic planning for using AI effectively. True productivity gains require a thoughtful approach, including standardized tools and clear metrics, rather than leaving employees to figure it all out themselves.</p>

To ensure realism, Bigelow consulted with military experts, including a retired general who once commanded a missile defense base and a former director of the White House Situation Room.

The threat from President Trump, who cited China's "very hostile" moves, caused significant turmoil in financial markets, wiping an estimated $2 trillion off the value of U.S. stocks on Friday.

The case was marked by a flawed initial investigation where the scene was released and cleaned before it was deemed a potential homicide.

These include rescuing children from every struggle, modeling perfection instead of accountability, and silencing their big emotions. The article advises that instead of prizing achievement above all else, parents should praise effort and teach kids that their worth is unconditional. Fostering mental fortitude involves allowing children to face age-appropriate challenges, repairing trust after parental mistakes, and teaching them that difficult feelings are manageable and not emergencies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the appointment of conservative commentator Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is not a sudden shift but the result of a long-term strategy. The author traces this plan back to the 1971 Powell Memo, which urged corporations to exert influence over media to promote a pro-business narrative and counter accountability journalism. The article alleges that media executives, including at CBS, actively participated in this project to shift news coverage away from scrutinizing corporate power. The author argues that Weiss's ascent represents the fulfillment of this half-century effort to transform major news outlets into champions, rather than adversaries, of the powerful.</p>

          <h2>China's Secrecy Agency Warns Propaganda Departments Against Leaking State Secrets to Media</h2>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a public warning to staff in propaganda departments and other classified units to prevent media leaks. An article published by an affiliated social media account cited several instances where news media had disclosed state secrets due to lax confidentiality reviews. The agency cautioned that public-facing information is often scrutinized by "external forces" and that some news workers, in a pursuit of novelty, were prioritizing publicity over security. The warning underscores the government's tightening grip on information control across its vast network of state-run entities.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that the prime minister's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, had no role in the "substance or the evidence" related to the recently collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The charges were dropped after prosecutors said the government failed to provide necessary evidence confirming China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. Conservatives have suggested Powell, who has favored closer relations with Beijing, was behind the decision not to disclose the information. The government maintains it could only act based on the official policy designation of China at the time.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's Mayor Gong Zheng announced that the city will eliminate all limits on foreign investment in its manufacturing sector as part of a broader effort to open its market. The reforms have already granted overseas companies greater access in fields such as electric vehicles, biotechnology, and value-added telecommunications. Gong emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers will be treated equally in government procurement processes. The move is designed to support their integration into both upstream and downstream supply chains, signaling a significant step in deepening the city's economic reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with creator J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that many classic works were created by flawed individuals. Instead of simple boycotts or "offsetting" purchases with donations, the article suggests a more meaningful approach: engaging with the material critically and in community with others. By discussing the work's flaws and its positive core messages about rejecting supremacy, fans can generate social good and transform their relationship with the canon, much like religious communities have done with sacred texts for centuries.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister John Swinney stated that the precedent set in 2011, which led to the 2014 independence referendum, should apply again if his Scottish National Party (SNP) wins a majority in the next Holyrood election. After the SNP's 2011 majority, the UK government approved a legally binding vote. Swinney argues this history puts the SNP in a strong position to demand another referendum, despite the current UK Labour government's opposition. Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander reiterated that his party's manifesto opposes another referendum, setting up a potential constitutional clash if the SNP achieves its electoral goal.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has urged the Trump administration to follow his lead in removing "corrupt judges," a call that has found support among prominent Maga figures. This comes amid what experts describe as unprecedented threats against the U.S. judiciary, fueled by rhetoric from the administration. Bukele, who dismissed judges and the attorney general in his own country, has repeatedly attacked the U.S. legal system. Experts warn that these attacks are part of a broader authoritarian strategy to undermine judicial independence and democratic accountability, mirroring tactics used in countries like Hungary and Turkey.</p>

          <p>A Florida official appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis is leading an initiative to audit and identify "wasteful" spending in Democratic-run local governments, but the effort is facing criticism. Officials in Broward County, the first to be targeted, claim the state's calculation of $189 million in "excessive spending" is based on inaccurate population and inflation data and ignores unfunded mandates from the state. The initiative is also under scrutiny after two armed police officers were sent to the home of a military veteran who had sent a non-threatening postcard to the official criticizing his actions. Critics argue the audits are a politically motivated attack on DeSantis's opponents.</p>

          <p>Rangers FC's search for a new manager is in disarray after their top choice, former manager Steven Gerrard, declined the offer, citing that the timing was not right. This article analyzes the club's predicament, noting this is the second time Gerrard has turned them down recently, with insiders suggesting his reluctance stemmed from an unwillingness to work under the club's new sporting director structure. The rejection forces the Rangers board to consider other candidates, like Danny Rohl, whose limited managerial experience represents a significant gamble. The situation highlights the challenges of the role and the club's struggle to find a leader.</p>
