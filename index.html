          <p>In his New York retrial, Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley, but not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding Kaja Sokola. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of third-degree rape involving Jessica Mann, leading the judge to instruct them to continue deliberations. The retrial began after Weinstein's initial conviction was overturned, with the current proceedings marked by apparent tension and infighting among jurors. Weinstein himself addressed the court, claiming he was not receiving a fair trial, while his defense attorney expressed disgust with the jury's behavior.

          <p>President Trump's spending bill is facing challenges in the Senate due to Republican divisions over tax cuts, immigration enforcement, and defense spending.

Services like Esusu are working to democratize access to credit by partnering with landlords and creating direct lines for renters to report their rent payments, potentially boosting credit scores.

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA is rolling back pollution limits for power plants, allowing more unhealthy air toxins and unlimited planet-heating gases. The plan repeals a climate rule to eliminate greenhouse gases from power plants by the 2030s and weakens another regulation restricting hazardous air pollutants like mercury. Experts warn this will lead to pollution increases and harm public health, despite the EPA claiming it will save households money and defy the "climate change cult".
