          <p>A woman was stopped by the Transportation Security Administration at Miami International Airport after being discovered hiding two turtles inside her bra. The animals were wrapped in gauze and plastic, and tragically, one of the turtles did not survive the ordeal. The surviving reptile was handed over to the Florida Department of Fish andWildlife. The TSA used the incident to publicly remind travelers that while pets are allowed through security, they must be properly declared and carried, not concealed on one's person in such a manner.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist based in the U.S. shared her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting significant differences from American stores. She was impressed by the vast selection of traditional Japanese foods, including a wide variety of seaweed, diverse tofu and soy products, and seasonal local produce. The store also offered numerous healthy ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and an extensive range of green tea products. The article notes these items, often considered staples in Japanese cuisine for their health benefits, are less common or more expensive in U.S. locations.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Hazardous 'Forever Chemicals' Present in Some Reusable Period Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 10:24:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Notre Dame have detected per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as "forever chemicals," in nearly a third of tested reusable period products like underwear and menstrual cups. These chemicals, which are linked to cancer and other health issues, do not easily break down and can be absorbed through the skin or enter the environment after disposal. The study highlights that the presence of PFAS is not necessary for the products' function, as many competing brands are manufactured without them. Researchers hope this raises consumer awareness and pressures companies to eliminate these potentially harmful substances from their supply chains.</p>

          <p>A legal challenge by a fired Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member is poised to test the limits of a president's authority over independent agencies. The case, *Slaughter v. Trump*, directly confronts the nearly century-old Supreme Court precedent of *Humphrey's Executor*, which limited a president's power to remove commissioners without cause. Legal experts suggest the current Supreme Court may be inclined to overturn or narrow this precedent, potentially increasing presidential control over agencies like the FTC. The outcome of this fight could significantly alter the balance of power between the executive branch and independent regulatory bodies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old man, Christopher Kennedy, who was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) after a routine pre-surgery scan, has successfully undergone a double-lung transplant. Initially asymptomatic, his condition progressed to the point where he was given less than a year to live before the transplant became his only option. Despite initial hesitation and post-surgery complications, including an infection and a stroke, Kennedy has made a remarkable recovery with his lung capacity now at 98%. He has since returned to training hospital therapy dogs, a passion that has gained new meaning following his own medical journey.</p>

The company revealed that the 25% U.S. tariffs have already cost it €1.3 billion, leading to a significant drop in operating profit and a revised financial forecast. Beyond a general EU-U.S. agreement, Volkswagen is lobbying for company-specific provisions that would allow its substantial investments in the U.S., such as a new plant in South Carolina, to offset its tariff liabilities.

          <p>After winning a recent match, tennis champion Venus Williams quipped that she had to return to competition for the health insurance benefits, shedding light on a common struggle for many Americans. Because most U.S. health insurance is tied to employment, taking a break from work, as Williams did, often means losing coverage or facing expensive COBRA premiums. The article explains that even for a wealthy athlete with specific health needs like Williams, navigating the U.S. healthcare system can be challenging. Her situation illustrates the concept of "job lock," where individuals feel compelled to remain employed to maintain necessary health benefits.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned the Hong Kong government for offering cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of 19 pro-democracy activists residing in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression" and affirmed their commitment to protecting the rights and safety of those who have made the UK their home. The activists are accused of violating Beijing's national security law. This is the latest instance of Hong Kong authorities placing bounties on overseas dissidents, escalating tensions with Western governments.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a dramatic 29-26 victory over Australia with a last-minute try by Hugo Keenan, clinching the series in a thrilling Test match in Melbourne. In front of a record crowd of over 90,000, the Lions had to mount a remarkable comeback after trailing 23-5 in a stunning first half dominated by a resurgent Wallabies team. The game was a tense, back-and-forth affair, with six tries scored in the first half alone. The Lions' victory, sealed after a nerve-wracking TMO review, marks the first time they have won the first two Tests of a series since 1997.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory complex resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and left a 19-year-old injured. The incident occurred early Friday morning when a suspect opened fire on a group of four people playing video games inside a dorm room. New Mexico State Police arrested an 18-year-old suspect, John Fuentes, hours later and charged him with first-degree murder and other offenses. The shooting prompted a campus-wide shelter-in-place order and the closure of the central campus for the day, tragically impacting the university's new student orientation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters chose not to remove two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall effort, supported by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was initiated over concerns that the KMT-led legislative majority was obstructing key government policies and passing laws favorable to Beijing. The failure of the recall signals that President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face a challenging and resistant legislature. Analysts view the outcome as a setback for the DPP, highlighting public fatigue with blanket "anti-China" political strategies and solidifying the opposition's power.</p>

          <p>The Chinese military's procurement department has blacklisted the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) for engaging in bid rigging and collusion. The suspension, announced on Thursday, bars the prominent state-run institute from participating in military procurement for an unspecified period. This is the second time this year the institute, which conducts critical research in areas like remote sensing and electronic countermeasures, has been placed on a suspension list. The penalty highlights Beijing's efforts to crack down on corruption and misconduct within its vast defense-industrial complex.</p>

          <p>According to a Politico report, Navy Secretary John Phelan is taking steps to centralize power and limit the authority of his incoming undersecretary, Hung Cao, even before Cao's Senate confirmation. Internal memos and sources suggest that decision-making and analysis will be consolidated within the secretary's front office, effectively sidelining the undersecretary's traditional role in key areas like shipbuilding and research. This internal power struggle is seen as a potential disruption to the Navy's efforts to manage its massive budget and address critical strategic challenges, particularly competition with China's growing naval power.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, conditions in the country have deteriorated, according to analysts. The junta, led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani, cited insecurity and economic hardship to justify its takeover, but little has improved. The regime has cracked down on civil liberties, forced many NGOs to cease operations, leading to job losses, and has shown no clear path back to civilian rule. Niger has since joined military-led Mali and Burkina Faso in withdrawing from the regional bloc ECOWAS, deepening its political isolation and instability.</p>

          <p>A loneliness epidemic is reportedly growing among young people in Germany, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and social media. According to a WHO study, one in five teenagers worldwide feels lonely, and sociologists in Germany are observing a concerning link between youth loneliness and susceptibility to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. Experts note that chronic loneliness can lead to resentment and a sense of rejection, making individuals more vulnerable to conspiracy theories. The problem is not confined to urban areas, as those in rural communities with fewer opportunities for social interaction are also at high risk.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England has commenced, leading to significant disruptions across the NHS as thousands of operations and appointments are canceled. The walkout stems from a pay dispute between the British Medical Association (BMA) and the government. Patients have expressed anger and fear over the delays, with some worrying their conditions, including cancer, could worsen while they await rescheduled procedures. While the government insists disruption will be minimized, previous strikes have resulted in over a million cancellations, highlighting the profound impact of the industrial action on patient care.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old man sought advice from financial personality Dave Ramsey after his girlfriend of eight months requested a prenuptial agreement to keep their finances separate. The man expressed a desire to combine assets, while his girlfriend, who also owns property, preferred to protect her individual holdings. Ramsey advised the couple to slow down and address their fundamental disagreements on money, which he identified as a major cause of divorce. He suggested their differing views on a prenup indicate a deeper misalignment of values and trust that should be resolved before considering marriage. (not investment advice)</p>
