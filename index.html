            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policies are causing disruption at US maritime gateways, particularly those handling goods from China. Ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, which manage a significant portion of US containerized cargo, are experiencing operational disarray and increased uncertainty. Supply-chain analysts anticipate rerouting, uneven port utilization, slower trade, and potential job losses. Despite a recent surge in activity due to importers stockpiling goods, the long-term effects of the tariffs are expected to create a 'bumpy' ride for ports and related industries.

            <p>An opinion piece draws parallels between Donald Trump's trade policies and the actions of Empress Dowager Cixi, whose declaration of war on Western powers led to the collapse of imperial China. The author suggests that Trump's tariffs are fueled by outdated assumptions about American industrial might. While some fear a slide into pre-World War II-style economic aggression, the author believes China will not seek confrontation but will prepare for it, standing firm on core interests. The piece reflects concerns about escalating trade tensions and their potential global ramifications.</p>

The piece accuses Democrats of disloyalty to the Constitution and projecting their own flaws onto Republicans, ultimately calling for accountability and resistance against Democratic saboteurs.</p>

The Saints have used the fleur-de-lis since 1967 and trademarked it in 1974 for use in professional football entertainment. The court affirmed the symbol's association with the team.</p>

If accepted, this could reduce the agency's workforce by roughly 20%. Those accepting the offer will go on paid leave through the end of the fiscal year. The looming exodus coincides with the tax filing deadline. The Treasury Department claims the departures are comparable to the number of employees added under the previous administration.

Filing an extension provides an additional six months to complete and submit their tax returns. However, taxpayers are still required to pay any owed taxes by the original deadline to avoid penalties. The IRS offers various online and mail-in options for filing an extension, and also provides payment plans for those who cannot afford to pay their taxes on time.</p>

The bill would require courts to maintain trackable records of restraining orders and make them accessible within one day, addressing a bureaucratic failure that allowed the father to purchase the murder weapon.</p>
