          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens, particularly women, about an increasing number of kidnappings across the country. This alert follows multiple recent incidents and a fatal home invasion targeting Chinese nationals. Analysts believe Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they operate largely with cash and outside the formal banking system, making them vulnerable. The embassy has urged its nationals to avoid going out alone and to take extra precautions to ensure their personal and property safety amid the rise in violent crime.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Sues California Over Regulations Impacting Egg Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 23:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against the state of California, arguing its regulations on egg production are unlawfully driving up prices nationwide. The suit claims that California's laws, which mandate specific space requirements for hens to improve animal welfare and food safety, impose "unnecessary red tape" on out-of-state producers. Administration officials contend these state-level rules interfere with federal authority over egg safety standards and contribute to inflation. California has previously defended its regulations against legal challenges from other states, with the Supreme Court preserving a similar initiative in 2023.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have sunk a second cargo vessel in the Red Sea, the Greek-operated Eternity C, just a week after a similar attack. At least three crew members were killed, and others remain missing, though six were rescued after the ship was hit by rocket-propelled grenades. The Houthis claimed they attacked the vessel for heading to Israel and stated they took some crew members to a "safe location." These escalating attacks on commercial shipping, which the group claims are in support of Palestinians, have now sunk four ships and killed at least seven seafarers since November.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative party, is advocating for a new policy that would prevent foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits. In an upcoming speech, she will frame Britain's rising welfare bill as a "ticking time bomb" that requires tighter curbs to avoid economic collapse. The proposal aims to limit access to benefits like the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to British citizens, with some exceptions. This move seeks to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour party, which recently scaled back its own plans for welfare cuts.</p>

The Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach nursed the pelicans back to health.

          <h2>Study Finds California's Life Expectancy Has Not Fully Recovered to Pre-Pandemic Levels</h2>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California, while improving, remains nearly a year lower than it was in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the virus was the initial cause of the decline, the persistent gap is now primarily driven by deaths from drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The recovery has been notably slower for Black and Hispanic Californians, highlighting ongoing racial and income-based health disparities. The findings suggest that the pandemic exacerbated long-standing public health challenges that continue to impact mortality rates across the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur who investigates human rights in the Palestinian territories, for her criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza. U.S. officials accused Albanese of expressing support for terrorism and promoting antisemitism, claims she has previously denied. The move is part of a broader U.S. campaign against international bodies and officials perceived as biased against Israel, including the International Criminal Court. The sanctions were condemned by human rights advocates as an attempt to silence critical voices and undermine international law.</p>

          <p>As he prepared to begin a seven-year prison sentence for fraud, former Rep. George Santos made a final, unsubstantiated claim on social media. After posting a message stating he was not suicidal and warning against false reports, a follower asked why he had not been pardoned. Santos alleged that House Speaker Mike Johnson had "Blocked it," implying Johnson had prevented President Trump from issuing a pardon. The claim was met with widespread skepticism, as the House Speaker does not have the authority to block a presidential pardon.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 jobs at NASA, targeting mostly senior-level employees with specialized and management experience. According to documents obtained by Politico, the staff reductions are part of a broader government-wide push to shrink the federal workforce through buyouts and early retirements. The proposed cuts, along with a potential 47% reduction in the NASA science budget, have caused alarm within the space industry. Former agency officials warn these moves could cede U.S. leadership in space exploration to other nations like China.</p>

          <p>A former Kerr County official has stated that emergency flood alerts were delayed as the disaster unfolded because dispatchers needed authorization from a supervisor. Review of emergency radio traffic from the morning of the flood reveals a firefighter requesting a CodeRED alert be sent to residents, only to be told it required approval. Despite the National Weather Service issuing 22 warnings, including a "PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION" alert, many residents reported receiving no local warnings. This potential failure in the emergency response system is now under scrutiny as the community grapples with the devastating loss of life.</p>

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic expressed optimism about finalizing an agreement before the extended August 1 deadline. The situation remains complex, however, as the U.S. continues its strategy of using tariff threats to renegotiate trade relationships with key partners globally, including Brazil and Japan.</p>

The massive assault occurred shortly after President Trump criticized Vladimir Putin and confirmed the U.S. would resume sending defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent pause.
