            <p>The UK housing market sees a surge in low-deposit mortgage deals, reaching the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. This provides a boost for first-time buyers, despite higher house prices and mortgage rates. Competition is fierce, with homes selling relatively quickly. However, uncertainty over interest rates and stamp duty changes remains a factor for buyers.</p>

            <p>President Trump blamed Ukrainian President Zelensky for starting the war with Russia, a day after a deadly Russian attack in Ukraine. Trump claimed Zelensky shared the blame with Putin and criticized Biden's handling of the conflict. He also questioned Zelensky's competence and accused him of seeking to purchase missiles. Trump's comments followed a heated exchange with Zelensky at the White House in February.</p>

            <p>The U.S.'s $2.36 trillion tourism business is experiencing anxiety over the potential impact of Trump's trade policies on international visitors. Preliminary figures show a decline in visits to the US, particularly from China. The uncertainty is sending chills through the travel industry, with warnings of a potential "Trump Slump." However, a weakening dollar could make travel to the US more attractive, and some international visitors remain undeterred.</p>

            <p>Farmers across the US face potential financial ruin due to Trump's tariffs and cuts to federal programs. Climate crisis-fueled extreme weather has compounded the situation, leading to significant crop losses. Farmers are concerned about being used as bargaining chips and are seeking a bailout to compensate for losses. The cuts to federal climate and conservation schemes, along with trade chaos, have created uncertainty and anxiety among the agricultural base.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration cut funding to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to fund the National Garden of American Heroes, a sculpture garden with 250 likenesses of people deemed “American heroes.” This move represents a shift from supporting intellectual and historical inquiry to demanding reverence. The repurposing of funds signals a fundamental change in values for the federal government, replacing inquiry with a manner of codifying history and closing the books.</p>

            <p>A high-level international conference is taking place in London to find a "pathway to peace" in Sudan, co-chaired by the UK, EU, and African Union. The aim is to unite international partners around a common position, increase aid to Sudan, and chart a way to end the hostilities. Neither of Sudan's main warring parties has been invited, but regional allies will be represented. The war has caused a humanitarian crisis, with millions displaced and widespread reports of violence.</p>
