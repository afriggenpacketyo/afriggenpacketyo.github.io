          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK is set to announce plans to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. This move aims to highlight divisions within the Labour party, as Keir Starmer has also announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments but without specific details. Reform UK intends to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and asylum seeker hotels. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the proposals as unrealistic promises that the country cannot afford. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing police reform, with Police Chief Brian O'Hara focused on internal changes for safer streets and community trust. Despite a decrease in shootings, Minneapolis is struggling with violent crime compared to other major cities due to officer shortages. O'Hara is working to restore pride within the department, adjust arrest tactics, and improve community engagement. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of several police agencies, but O'Hara insists reform efforts will continue in Minneapolis, with residents noting positive changes in policing.</p>

The attack underscores the failure of ongoing cease-fire negotiations, while Ukraine has also increased its air attacks on Russian territory, albeit on a smaller scale. Despite the intensified violence, Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, releasing a total of 1,000 prisoners from each side.</p>

Some experts believe Trump is exploiting his office for personal gain, while others are concerned about foreign influence and the SEC's lax oversight of crypto firms with ties to Trump.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with services now the responsibility of the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator. The government emphasized plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure but refrained from promising lower fares. Unions voiced concerns over potential outsourcing of staffing to private companies, while the opposition criticized Labour for needing to deliver on promises. Further renationalization is expected with C2C and Greater Anglia later this year. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the move as a watershed moment.</p>
