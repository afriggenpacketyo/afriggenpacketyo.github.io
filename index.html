          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that the U.S. is ready to "fight and win" against China if deterrence fails, emphasizing the need for Asian allies to enhance military coordination and boost defense spending. Hegseth criticized China's increasing military pressure in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, urging leaders to take urgent action. He also vowed to eliminate China's influence over the Panama Canal, asserting U.S. control over the key terrain. Hegseth's statements come amidst rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, with U.S. officials expressing concerns about China's intent to alter the regional status quo.

          <p>An inquest is underway in Australia to investigate the Bondi mass stabbing, seeking to understand how Joel Cauchi, a 40-year-old with a history of mental illness, was able to fatally stab six people and injure 10 others at a popular Sydney shopping center. The inquiry is focusing on Cauchi's interactions with police and mental health professionals in the years leading up to the attack, with scrutiny on the decision to wean him off anti-psychotic medication in 2018. Families of the victims shared emotional testimonies, highlighting the "cumulative failures" of multiple systems.

This action is part of Trump's broader effort to reshape federal cultural institutions, which he has criticized as being leftist and anti-American.

          <p>UC Irvine's baseball team lost to Arizona State 4-2 in the Los Angeles Regional of the NCAA tournament, failing to capitalize on key scoring opportunities.

Jacob McCombs' attempted sacrifice bunt in the fifth inning did not lead to any runs, and Alonso Reyes hit into a double play in the eighth with the bases loaded.

          <p>President Donald Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, claiming it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and be "controlled by the USA." Trump announced plans to double steel import tariffs to 50% and said Nippon would invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel, promising no layoffs and a $5,000 bonus for workers. However, he later stated he has yet to see the final details of the deal. The Biden administration had previously blocked the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel over national security concerns.
