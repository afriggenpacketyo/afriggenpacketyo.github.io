        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a royal expert, Kate Middleton has achieved royal success by adhering to royal rules and avoiding the rebellious path of Princess Diana. Unlike Diana, who entered the royal family at a young age, Kate was more mature when she married Prince William, which allowed her to better navigate the scrutiny and expectations of royal life. Kate's composed and dutiful approach, supported by a strong family and Prince William, contrasts with Diana's struggles with press intrusion and lack of palace support. The article emphasizes that the monarchy's future looks promising, partly due to Kate's ability to balance public duty with personal life, in a way that Diana struggled to do.</p>

          <p>Britain's armed forces are facing significant challenges, including dwindling troop numbers, weak morale, and aging equipment, amidst growing geopolitical uncertainty. A Strategic Defence Review is underway to address these issues, but doubts remain about its ability to achieve realistic goals. The article points to weaknesses in the army's ability to meet NATO commitments and the need for increased investment in technology and military hardware. The real problem is whether the UK will do less or spend a lot more.</p>

Sixty years ago, on May 12, 1965, Germany and Israel established diplomatic relations after a long period of preparation. The visit takes place during the first days of the new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the conservative Christian Democrats(CDU). Despite all the criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians have repeatedly emphasized that Israel has the right to defend itself after the terror attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>Former members of UK Special Forces have broken years of silence to give BBC Panorama eyewitness accounts of alleged war crimes committed by colleagues in Iraq and Afghanistan. Giving their accounts publicly for the first time, the veterans described seeing members of the SAS murder unarmed people in their sleep and execute handcuffed detainees, including children. One veteran who served with the SAS in Afghanistan said: "They handcuffed a young boy and shot him," "He was clearly a child, not even close to fighting age." The new testimony includes allegations of war crimes stretching over more than a decade, far longer than the three years currently being examined by a judge-led public inquiry in the UK.</p>
