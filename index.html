          <p>One year after a catastrophic landfill avalanche killed 34 people in Kampala, Uganda, affected residents are still awaiting compensation and living in fear. The disaster prompted the closure of the Kiteezi landfill, but the city's new waste disposal site is mired in controversy over its location in a potential forest reserve. Despite government promises and some international aid to secure the old site, victims remain in a precarious situation as authorities struggle with long-term waste management solutions.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery partially owned by a Russian firm for processing discounted Russian crude, a move intended to limit Moscow's war funding. However, experts believe this action is largely symbolic and will not derail ongoing EU-India free trade negotiations. They argue that a greater pressure point for India is the threat of potential U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically increase India's motivation to finalize a trade agreement with the EU as a more predictable economic partner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has reformed its civil service summer internship program to exclusively target applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds, sparking a mixed reaction. While some students from disadvantaged families feel the change gives them a fair opportunity, others who consider themselves working-class but do not meet the strict criteria feel unfairly excluded. The policy aims to make the civil service more representative of society, but critics argue its narrow definition of 'working class' could alienate deserving candidates and deter them from public service careers.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have achieved a significant breakthrough by creating high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory setting. This rare diamond structure, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic arrangement than common cubic diamonds. The research team successfully synthesized crystals up to 100 micrometers in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence. This achievement, published in the journal Nature, overcomes previous challenges where attempts yielded mixed-phase or cubic diamond samples.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed no year-on-year change in July, indicating that domestic demand remains sluggish amid ongoing trade challenges. This flat reading was slightly better than the anticipated decline, following a marginal 0.1% rise in June. Meanwhile, the producer price index continued its deflationary trend, highlighting persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector. The data reflects a mixed economic picture where policies to stimulate demand are showing some effect, but overall price pressures remain subdued. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disney and actress Gina Carano have settled a lawsuit she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. While details are private, a Lucasfilm statement praised Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future collaboration. The article argues that her firing was an overreaction and that the settlement was the right decision, separate from broader concerns about "cancel culture" or corporate capitulation. It suggests the initial termination was an extreme response to posts that, while provocative, were less severe than what is common on social media.</p>

          <p>The political standoff over Texas's congressional map has intensified, with the state's Republican attorney general suing to vacate the seats of absent Democratic lawmakers. These Democrats fled to blue states to block a GOP-led redistricting effort, and on Friday they met with California Governor Gavin Newsom in Sacramento. In response to the Texas plan, California leaders announced they are prepared to advance a retaliatory ballot measure to redraw their own state's map to favor Democrats, vowing to "nullify" any gains Republicans make in Texas.</p>

          <p>A chief market technician at BTIG is forecasting an imminent 5% pullback for the S&P 500, suggesting the index could fall to the 6,100 level before presenting a new buying opportunity. The prediction is based on several technical indicators, including observed weakness in consumer-focused sectors like retail and transportation. Other contributing factors include the historical underperformance of semiconductor stocks in late summer and potential profit-taking in major tech companies following strong earnings reports.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent advertising bans against major UK retailers like Zara and M&S for using models who appeared "unhealthily thin" have fueled concerns about a return of the "super skinny" trend. The UK's Advertising Standards Authority reports a notable increase in complaints regarding the weight of models in ads. While some fashion experts connect the trend to the rise of weight-loss drugs and 90s fashion revivals, others worry it signals a regression after years of progress in body positivity. The debate highlights the fashion industry's ongoing struggle with promoting diverse and healthy body images.</p>

Vance is currently on a personal holiday in the UK, which began with a stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, their Christian faith, and education at elite U.S. universities. This personal relationship is seen as potentially valuable for UK-US relations, especially given the personalized nature of diplomacy under the current U.S. administration.</p>
