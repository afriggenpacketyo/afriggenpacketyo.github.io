          <p>Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel has called on the UK government to support potential US action against Iran, emphasizing the need to stand with allies during a crisis. Patel argued that the UK should offer assistance to the US, including the use of military bases and aircraft refueling, if requested. However, concerns have been raised by the Attorney General regarding the legality of Israeli actions in Iran under international law, potentially restricting the UK's ability to support US intervention. Patel stressed that national security should take precedence, especially considering Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities which pose a threat to the UK, and that the UK cannot hide behind legal advice at a time of crisis, but should support its biggest ally. The situation remains tense as the UK navigates its legal obligations and its alliance with the US.</p>

          <p>Yoshihiko Noda, head of Japan's main opposition party, has ruled out submitting a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely, as the ruling bloc led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives. Noda cited concerns over higher U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East as reasons to avoid a political vacuum. The House of Councillors election is expected to be held on July 20, with Ishiba's government struggling to bridge differences with the United States over tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The opposition party would need support from others for a no-confidence motion to pass.</p>

          <p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has claimed responsibility for firing hypersonic missiles at Israel, marking the latest exchange of strikes between the two nations. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported striking an Iranian centrifuge production site in Tehran, along with several weapons factories. Amidst the conflict, the first plane carrying stranded Israelis landed at Ben Gurion Airport, while Iran's UN ambassador vowed a strong response to Israeli and potential US aggression. The UN's nuclear watchdog has indicated that two Iranian facilities producing centrifuge parts were hit, and the German ambassador to Tehran was summoned due to Chancellor Friedrich Merz's remarks about Israel doing "the dirty work for us all."</p>

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend the signing ceremony, building on principles agreed upon in April. This deal seeks to attract Western investment to the mineral-rich region, but the commitment of the Congo River Alliance, including the M23 rebel group, remains uncertain, as previous ceasefires have been broken.</p>

          <p>Escalating tensions between Israel and Iran have led to a significant increase in shipping insurance costs in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for journeys into the Gulf, up from 0.125% before Israel's recent attack on Iran. War risk insurance rates have also risen in the Red Sea, while coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. The period for which quotes are valid has been reduced from 48 to 24 hours, reflecting the deteriorating security situation. Despite the increased costs, cargo flow through these areas continues, with close monitoring of potential US intervention.</p>

Negotiations have been ongoing since April, with Trump imposing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, threatening further levies on Japanese imports. While Ishiba and Trump agreed to accelerate negotiations during a meeting in Canada, gaps remain, particularly over auto tariffs, complicating efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

          <p>During a visit to the White House, former President Donald Trump engaged in an awkward exchange with members of the Juventus football team, pressing them for their views on transgender women in sports. Trump, who signed an executive order banning transgender participants from women’s sports, repeatedly questioned the players, prompting nervous smiles and deflections. The incident occurred amidst increasing hostility towards trans people in the US, coinciding with a Supreme Court ruling that upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors. The Juventus general manager attempted to steer the conversation toward the team's successful women's team, but Trump insisted that they "should be playing with women."</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test firing at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, resulting in a significant setback for the Super Heavy-Starship program. The explosion occurred while the Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and methane fuel, sending debris across the test site. SpaceX confirmed the incident, stating that all personnel were safe and that they were working to secure the area, but the explosion's impact on the test site infrastructure remains unclear. This mishap will likely delay the next test flight, which is critical for NASA's plans to use Starship for lunar landings.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully created a compact device capable of producing controlled nuclear reactions between hydrogen and lithium. This portable neutron gun utilizes a novel electromagnetic technique to generate a high-intensity neutron beam, producing 10 billion fast neutrons per second. Each neutron carries 3 million electron volts of energy, comparable to particles emitted during an atomic bomb explosion. This breakthrough has significant implications for scientific, industrial, and defense applications, marking a notable advancement in neutron generation technology.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in central London by piecing together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, reveal intricate details of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The team is still searching for a missing fragment bearing the artist's name, as the art reveals local plants such as mistletoe and a classical idea which incorporates a North West European twist. The villa, dating back to the first or second century AD, may have been home to a wealthy family or a hotel for rich travelers.</p>

          <p>The idea of regime change in Iran is appealing, given the country's repressive policies and destabilizing actions in the region, however, it is also fraught with challenges. While the removal of the current theocratic regime would address numerous international threats, history suggests that regime change is rarely a straightforward process. The experiences in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya serve as cautionary tales, highlighting the potential for prolonged instability and suffering. A defeated Iran could lead to civic unrest and power struggles, as well as a weakened Islamic republic which could lead to further chaos, and it's important to consider these potential consequences before advocating for regime change.</p>
