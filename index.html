        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review, led by Baroness Harriet Harman KC, has unveiled systemic sexual harassment and bullying within England and Wales' legal profession, known as the Bar. The comprehensive report, prompted by a 2023 study on rising inappropriate conduct, revealed that 44% of barristers experienced or observed such behavior, with junior members often fearing career repercussions for reporting. Specific accounts detailed instances of groping and propositioning, underscoring a significant power dynamic. The review urgently calls for robust measures to protect future victims and preserve the Bar's reputation as a pillar of the rule of law.</p>

Headlines also scrutinised Sir Keir Starmer's new cabinet, particularly concerning workers' rights following Angela Rayner's departure and the sacking of the Employment Rights Minister. Amidst the political news, many papers celebrated England's cricket team's victory over South Africa in Southampton, where Jacob Bethell's first professional century led to a record-setting winning margin in men's one-day-international history.</p>

          <p>Former Army Sergeant Major Michael Webber has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting 19-year-old Gunner Jaysley Beck, who later died by suicide. Beck had reported Webber for pinning her down and attempting to kiss her at a work event, but an inquest determined the Army's inadequate handling of her complaint played a significant role in her death. Her mother emphasized that the Army's failure to report the sexual assault to the police was a critical oversight. While the guilty plea brings some relief, the family believes proper institutional response could have prevented this devastating loss, prompting calls for improved policies.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei's La Libertad Avanza (LLA) party experienced a substantial defeat in the Buenos Aires provincial elections, losing to the opposition Peronist party by a larger margin than anticipated. This loss, occurring amid criticism over a bribery scandal and public spending cuts, serves as a significant setback for Milei. Despite admitting to "mistakes," the president vowed to "accelerate" his libertarian reforms ahead of national midterm elections. The outcome is seen as a crucial indicator, given Buenos Aires province contributes over 30% of Argentina's GDP and holds 40% of its voters.</p>

The agenda also includes combating child sexual abuse online and the proliferation of deadly synthetic opioids, as the government explores expanding accommodation options for asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of Jair Bolsonaro's supporters rallied across Brazil, including in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, just days before a Supreme Court verdict in his trial for an alleged coup attempt. Demonstrators demanded amnesty for those involved in the January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings in Brasília. Bolsonaro and seven co-defendants, including former ministers, are accused of plotting to overturn the 2022 election results. If found guilty, Bolsonaro would become the first former president in Brazil's history convicted of attempting a coup, potentially facing over 40 years in prison.</p>

As a result, any assets held by Seki within Chinese territory will be frozen, and all Chinese organizations and individuals are prohibited from engaging in transactions or working with him.

          <p>China's August shipments to the U.S. plunged by 33%, contributing to the slowest overall export growth in six months, falling below economists' expectations. This decline is largely attributed to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies targeting transshipments and the waning momentum of businesses frontloading exports. While China has diversified its markets, the U.S. remains its largest single-country trading partner, absorbing $283 billion in goods this year as of August. Bilateral trade talks have shown little progress, and tightening U.S. scrutiny on goods routed through third countries is expected to further impact Chinese exports. (not investment advice)</p>

This finding challenges previous assumptions about Mars' internal structure and cooling rate, as most solar system bodies haven't cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core.

          <p>President Trump's attendance at the U.S. Open men's tennis final caused a 30-minute delay and long security lines for ticketholders, drawing mixed cheers and boos from the crowd. The televised event began with muffled sound during the national anthem, as the U.S. Tennis Association reportedly advised broadcasters to censor crowd reactions to the president. Trump's appearance in Rolex's luxury box, alongside its CEO, also sparked discussion, coming mere weeks after he imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss products. This marks his continued trend of attending high-profile sporting events during his second term, the first sitting president to attend the U.S. Open in over two decades.</p>

          <p>Ryan Wesley Routh is set to stand trial in Florida for an alleged assassination attempt on President Donald Trump last September, an incident that intensified scrutiny on political violence in the U.S. and Secret Service protection. Routh, 59, who has pleaded not guilty and will represent himself, was reportedly spotted in bushes near Trump's golf club and fired on an agent. FBI agents later found an SKS semiautomatic rifle with a scope and extended magazine in the area, along with documents listing Trump's upcoming appearances. The trial will take place in the same federal courthouse where Trump himself faced charges earlier.</p>

Speaking at the TUC annual conference, he urged ministers to make "right political choices," including lifting the two-child benefit cap, funded by new wealth taxes. Sharon Graham, leader of Unite, echoed these concerns, threatening to re-evaluate the union's significant financial ties with Labour if living standards don't improve. Union leaders are also concerned about potential watering down of the Employment Rights Bill, emphasizing the need for radical action to prevent voter shifts to parties like Reform UK.</p>

Trump, who has been actively involved in negotiations, stated there would not be another warning and expressed confidence in a deal soon, expecting all hostages to be returned, dead or alive. Hamas later confirmed receiving ideas from the U.S. through mediators and reiterated its readiness for negotiations to release all hostages in exchange for a clear announcement of an end to the war and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave.</p>

          <p>France's parliament is poised to oust Prime Minister François Bayrou in a confidence vote, marking another chapter in the country's year-long political deadlock. Bayrou initiated the vote to "shock" politicians into tackling France's spiraling national debt, which stands at 114% of its economic output, warning of "disorder and chaos" without austerity measures. However, he lacks the necessary votes, making his removal almost certain. This crisis stems from President Macron's 2024 snap election, which resulted in a weakened minority government and a deeply divided parliament, signaling a broader shift towards the right and far-right across the nation.</p>

          <p>The family of Raish Ahmed, a 50-year-old man murdered by his neighbor Daniel Whybrow in Canning Town, east London, has publicly criticized authorities for failing to protect him despite numerous complaints. Ahmed was repeatedly stabbed in front of horrified neighbors during a dispute over a communal door, after months of Whybrow's aggressive and anti-social conduct. His wife, Jannatul Mauwa, stated that her husband was "failed by London," specifically by police who ignored warnings and the council who did not adequately address the issues, despite being alerted to Whybrow's behavior and previous convictions. Whybrow has since been sentenced to life with a minimum term of 24 years for murder and causing grievous bodily harm.</p>

Leaders like Rev. Marshall Hatch called for residents to carry identification and stay connected, advocating resistance against what they term "fascism and authoritarianism." President Trump has threatened federal actions in "sanctuary cities" like Chicago, despite FBI data showing lower crime rates in these cities compared to some red states. This has heightened fears in Black and Latino communities, prompting clergy to remind people of their rights and emphasize resource allocation over military presence to address violence, which they see as a more effective solution.</p>

Robinson reported no unusual symptoms, attributing hip pain to a previous birth. The dramatic arrival, witnessed by family and aided by an off-duty paramedic, occurred during a match dedicated to a deceased "uncle Huggy," leading the couple to name their son Henry James in his memory.</p>

This crucial defensive play, alongside cornerback Cobie Durant's interception and multiple sacks, compensated for an offense still finding its rhythm. Quarterback Matthew Stafford passed for over 60,000 career yards, and receiver Puka Nacua showed grit with 10 catches despite an injury, contributing to the Rams' 7-2 record in openers under coach Sean McVay.</p>

          <p>Global investors are reportedly shifting capital away from US equities towards Asian markets, marking a significant diversification trend after a decade of US dominance. This move is driven by Asia's booming artificial intelligence sector, a weakening US dollar, and expectations of more accommodative Federal Reserve policies in 2025-2026, according to Candace Browning of Bank of America. While US equities attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020-2024, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now evenly allocating between US and international markets. Asia's AI market is projected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, offering compelling opportunities and better valuations compared to expensive US stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
