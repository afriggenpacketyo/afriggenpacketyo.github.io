        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles and affirmed the Trump administration's stance that the National Guard deployment is still necessary, despite waning protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of "endangering law enforcement" by allegedly encouraging violence during the protests. He suggested that the administration would not need to deploy the Guard if state and local officials protected federal law enforcement. Federal agents were seen outside the Los Angeles Dodgers ballpark after the team blocked immigration authorities from entering, though DHS claimed it was unrelated to any operation. Tensions remain high as federal immigration officers increase enforcement efforts, aiming for 3,000 arrests a day.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, on bail after he was detained by ICE. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat, despite the government's arguments. Khalil's arrest had sparked protests, with his attorneys arguing that his free speech rights were being violated, and the judge expressed skepticism about the government's reasons for keeping him detained. The government accused Khalil of failing to disclose information when applying for permanent residency, but the judge found this reason "highly unusual" and suggested it was a pretext to punish him for his protests. Under the conditions of his release, Khalil is permitted to travel domestically for court appearances, attorney visits, and lobbying purposes.</p>

          <p>Representative Darrell Issa suggested a constitutional amendment to facilitate the removal of a president deemed unable to perform their duties, citing concerns over the alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's health. Issa argued that the current 25th Amendment, relying on the Vice President and Cabinet, may be insufficient due to potential bias. He proposed involving Congress and the Supreme Court in the process. The House Oversight Committee is set to interview Biden administration officials regarding the former president's mental state, and the results of that investigation could inform the amendment's specifics. Amending the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber and ratification by three-quarters of states, presenting a significant hurdle.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allege that prosecutors intentionally violated his right to a fair trial by releasing his journal entries. The defense argues that the release of the entries, included in a filing to justify terrorism enhancement charges, serves no legitimate objective other than to bias the public. Mangione's attorneys are seeking to delay or dismiss the state case to focus on the federal prosecution, which could result in the death penalty. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is currently held in federal custody.</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously critiques the lack of a clear uniform for ICE agents, questioning how individuals are supposed to recognize them as law enforcement officials. The piece suggests that without a uniform, agents might be mistaken for rogue criminals rather than officers of the law. It mocks the idea that agents should prioritize self-expression over accountability and official representation. The article sarcastically advises agents to avoid anything that might identify them as acting in an official capacity, recommending outfits that would make people question their authority.</p>

          <p>A former Syracuse University basketball player, Brendan Paul, testified at Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial, stating that Combs became "extremely creative" when using drugs. Paul, who worked as Combs' personal assistant, was arrested with cocaine he claimed belonged to Combs. He testified under immunity, admitting to buying drugs for Combs on several occasions. Paul's testimony is part of the prosecution's effort to demonstrate that Combs oversaw a racketeering enterprise, while the defense acknowledges domestic violence but denies federal crimes. Despite mixed feelings about Combs, Paul maintained he would not work for a criminal.</p>

          <p>The Liberal government's One Canadian Economy Act, Bill C-5, passed in the House of Commons, granting cabinet the ability to expedite certain projects deemed in the national interest. The legislation allows the government to bypass laws like the Impact Assessment Act to accelerate construction. While supported by the Conservatives, the bill faced opposition from some First Nations and environmental groups, who fear it will grant the government sweeping powers to override other laws. Prime Minister Mark Carney promised to build big and bold, signaling support for new energy corridors and resource-related initiatives.</p>

The White House has stated that Iran has the necessary components to build a nuclear weapon within weeks. Trump's decision on whether to join Israel in strikes on Iran is expected within two weeks, and he has dismissed the intelligence community's assessment.</p>
