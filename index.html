        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Ukraine have finalized an agreement to share revenues from Ukraine's mineral reserves, creating a joint investment fund. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the agreement signals commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine and aims to give President Trump a personal stake in the country's fate. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal noted the countries would have equal voting rights over the fund, with Ukraine retaining control over its resources and profits reinvested locally. Some view the deal as a U.S. attempt to leverage Ukraine's reliance on aid for control of its resources, while others see it as a deterrent against future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Eleven students involved in an alleged hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team turned themselves in after the district attorney threatened kidnapping charges. Older players reportedly lured younger teammates to an isolated area, where masked accomplices simulated an abduction, tying up one student and placing him in a car trunk. The district attorney described the incident as "hazing on steroids" and expressed concern over the potential for tragedy, while the attorney for the students stated they regret their involvement and recognize their actions were inappropriate.

          <p>The Bank of Japan has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of trade policies on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The central bank now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a significant reduction from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent. This decision comes as President Trump's tariff threats weigh heavily on global economic prospects, exacerbating pressures on Japan's already fragile economy. The Bank of Japan also kept interest rates steady, complicating its efforts to revert to more conventional monetary policies amid tariff-induced economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The trial of Erin Patterson, accused of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder another by serving them a poisonous mushroom lunch, has begun in Australia. Her estranged husband testified that it was "very rare" for her to host social gatherings at home. The prosecution alleges Ms. Patterson invited the group to lunch "on the pretence she'd been diagnosed with cancer", while the defense claims she "panicked" after unintentionally serving poison. The case centers on a beef wellington lunch in July 2023 that resulted in the deaths of three people and the hospitalization of another.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated there is "a very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, despite his own trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, stating that no official negotiations are currently underway. Trump reiterated his view that the U.S. was previously "ripped off" by China and emphasized the need for a fair deal.

          <p>This article analyzes the shift in American foreign policy, noting a withdrawal from aid and democratic ideals that is causing confusion and concern among former allies. The author contrasts the current situation with the past, when the U.S. sought to shape the world in its image, highlighting China's growing influence in Asia. While some countries still desire American support and ideals, the Trump administration's policies, including tariff threats and dismantling of aid programs, are seen as another form of withdrawal, leading to questions about America's commitment to democracy and global leadership.</p>

          <p>A recent poll by the Asian American Foundation indicates that a quarter of non-Asian Americans view Chinese-Americans as a potential threat, particularly concerning national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings highlight a troubling disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and their actual experiences, reinforcing the stereotype of the "perpetual foreigner" and raising concerns about safety, belonging, and opportunities for this community.</p>

Harris also condemned Trump's immigration policies, asserting that it is unacceptable to detain or disappear American citizens without due process. She urged Americans to stand together and prepare for the challenges ahead, emphasizing that the country belongs to its citizens, not to whoever is in the White House.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee revised a bill to end solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, limiting its impact to those who sell their homes. The original bill, AB 942, aimed to shorten the incentive period for existing solar panel owners, but the committee removed that provision. Despite the amendment, concerns remain that the bill could reduce home values, prompting opposition from solar owners, schools, and environmental groups. The bill's proponent, Lisa Calderon, argues that the credits unfairly raise electric bills for non-solar owners, while opponents contend that utility spending is the primary driver of rising costs.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warned of a breakdown in the global order and the end of America's dominant economic role, suggesting that the global shift away from U.S. economic and geopolitical influence is underway. In response, Tesla CEO Elon Musk challenged Dalio's core claim—suggesting that China, not the U.S., is now the world's true consumption powerhouse. Musk stated that Chinese consumers will buy more cars than America and Europe combined this year, shifting the leverage in the global economy.</p>

          <p>Japanese energy firm Jera Co. has pledged to contribute to stable power supply this summer by utilizing one of the world's largest power plants fueled by liquefied natural gas. The firm showed the Kawagoe thermal power station in Mie Prefecture with a maximum output of 4.80 million kilowatts to the media ahead of summer, when electricity consumption rises due to high air conditioning usage. By utilizing the LNG-fired plant that can control output easily, Jera seeks to compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation, which has been rapidly expanding in the area.</p>

          <p>Stephen Cloobeck, a Democratic businessman, is suing former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa over the use of the phrase "proven problem solver" in campaign materials. Cloobeck, who has applied for a federal trademark of the phrase, claims it has become associated with his campaign. Villaraigosa's representatives dismissed the lawsuit as ludicrous, arguing the phrase is commonly used in politics. Legal scholars suggest the lawsuit has little chance of success, viewing it as a political tactic rather than a legitimate legal claim.</p>

Ukraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium, and the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.</p>
