          <p>Two siblings from Birmingham, aged 11 and 13, have drowned while swimming off a beach in Salou, Spain. The children, Ameiya and Ricardo Junior Parris, were on holiday with their parents when they encountered strong currents. Their father also required rescue after attempting to save them and has since been released from the hospital. A fundraising effort to repatriate the children's bodies has seen an overwhelming response from the public, raising over £30,000 for the grieving family.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced it will raise the U.S. prices for its original Switch family of systems and some accessories, citing "market conditions" influenced by trade tariffs. The price hikes, effective August 3, will impact the original Switch, Switch Lite, and OLED models, but not the new Switch 2 console for now. This decision comes as the company reports strong fiscal earnings and robust initial sales for the Switch 2. The move highlights how ongoing trade policy shifts are directly affecting consumer electronics pricing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of expectations and signaling a potential cooling of the labor market. Compounding the weak report, figures for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating that hiring was much weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, with job gains concentrated in the healthcare sector while federal government employment declined. The slowdown has intensified calls for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates amid ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission, designated Crew-11, proceeded after a one-day delay due to unfavorable weather conditions. The crew, commanded by NASA's Zena Cardman, includes members from the U.S., Japan, and Russia, continuing international cooperation aboard the station. This launch is notable as Cardman and other crew members were reassigned to this flight following issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.</p>

          <p>A new application called Balance is using artificial intelligence to help parents monitor their children's mental health by analyzing their online habits and language patterns. Developed by security company Aura, the tool tracks a child's digital activity to detect anomalies that could signal stress or mood shifts, providing parents with reports to facilitate conversations. While some parents in a clinical study found it helpful for opening dialogue, critics argue that systemic change from lawmakers and tech companies is needed to truly protect children online.</p>

          <p>Troy Taylor, the former head football coach at Stanford, is suing ESPN for defamation, alleging that a story published by the outlet led to his termination. The lawsuit claims an ESPN article falsely reported that multiple investigations found Taylor had engaged in hostile and aggressive behavior, particularly towards women. Taylor contends that the investigations were improperly disclosed and that their findings were misrepresented in the media. He is seeking punitive damages, asserting the network knowingly published false statements with the intent to harm his reputation.</p>

          <p>Advocates for in vitro fertilization are questioning the delay in the Trump administration's fulfillment of a campaign pledge to make the treatment more accessible and affordable. After campaigning on the promise, President Trump signed an executive order in February directing policy recommendations on IVF to be delivered by May, but that deadline has passed without an update. The issue is significant for many families, as a single IVF cycle can cost between $12,000 and $25,000, and is rarely covered by insurance.

Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the film successfully casts Neeson in the deadpan comedic role of Frank Drebin Jr., a successor to Leslie Nielsen's iconic character. The article praises the movie for its commitment to a high joke-per-minute ratio and its refreshing, nonsensical fun amidst a landscape of serious summer blockbusters. The film's reliance on silly gags and one-liners is seen as a delightful throwback to a style of comedy that has become rare in modern cinema.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Restrict Civil Service Internships to Students from Lower Socio-Economic Backgrounds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 11:39:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." The policy, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will also be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program, in a move aimed at improving social mobility within government.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled that Italy can use an accelerated process to deport migrants to countries designated as "safe," but only under specific conditions. The court stated that the sources used to designate a country as safe must be publicly accessible, and the designation must apply to the entire population, including minorities. This ruling came after an Italian court questioned the policy in the case of two Bangladeshi nationals who were sent to a detention center in Albania. The decision places new legal checks on Italy's controversial migration policies.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has been hit with a 39% tariff rate by the United States, one of the highest imposed on any European country, causing shock and dismay across the nation. The punitive rate is much higher than the 10% that Swiss officials had hoped for after recent negotiations and has been described as a major defeat. The primary sticking point appears to be the trade deficit Switzerland has with the U.S., which President Trump views as a problem. Swiss businesses are now warning of potential job losses as the government scrambles to negotiate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Utility workers installing a natural gas network in Lima, Peru, have unearthed a pre-Incan tomb containing the 1,000-year-old remains of an individual. The discovery was made in the capital city, which is home to over 400 archaeological sites. Alongside the human remains, which were found in a seated position wrapped in a bundle, archaeologists found clay vessels and artifacts linked to the Chancay culture. This is one of over 2,200 archaeological finds made by the same gas company during its two decades of excavation work in the region.</p>

          <p>As economic uncertainty continues, this article outlines five key rules for individuals considering an annuity for their retirement savings. These guidelines include keeping total annual fees below 1%, not buying a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for returns, and ensuring guaranteed income sources cover essential expenses. Financial planners also recommend allocating no more than 25% of a retirement portfolio to annuities to maintain diversification. These rules are intended to help retirees make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls in the complex annuity market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting August 1, interest will begin accruing again for the roughly 8 million student loan borrowers who were enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan. These borrowers had been placed in a zero-interest forbearance after court injunctions halted the program. The change could increase monthly costs by an average of $300 for a typical borrower. While enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance without making payments, their loan balances will now grow, prompting many to evaluate other repayment options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Allergy experts are increasingly warning that the common over-the-counter medication diphenhydramine, widely known as Benadryl, is an outdated drug whose risks outweigh its benefits. In a recent review, experts called for its removal from markets, citing side effects like sedation, cognitive impairment, and potential links to dementia in older adults. They argue that for every use case, including allergies and itching, newer and safer second-generation antihistamines like Zyrtec or Claritin are more effective. Doctors particularly caution against its use for food allergies, where it can mask worsening symptoms.</p>

These false claims were then widely circulated on the social media platform X, often used to dismiss the severity of the current situation in Gaza.
