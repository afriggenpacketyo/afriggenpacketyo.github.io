          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," House Speaker Mike Johnson reflected on the week's political climate following the assassination of activist Charlie Kirk, calling for a reduction in inflammatory rhetoric from all leaders. He emphasized that while vigorous debate is essential, it must be conducted with respect and without personal hatred, suggesting this could be a turning point for the nation's civil discourse. Johnson also addressed pressing legislative issues, stating his preference for a short-term, clean continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown and allow more time for appropriations. Additionally, he expressed strong support for imposing long-overdue sanctions on Russia in partnership with the White House.</p>

          <p>Members of the Sikh community organized a protest in Oldbury, West Midlands, to express solidarity with a woman who was the victim of a sexual assault that police are treating as a racially aggravated attack. The woman, in her 20s, was reportedly assaulted by two men who made racist remarks, an event that has deeply shaken the local population. Community leaders and politicians at the demonstration called for stronger measures to protect citizens and unite communities against division and extremism. In a public statement, the victim expressed profound gratitude for the incredible love and support she has received from her family and the community.</p>

Authorities have identified and arrested the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, on charges including aggravated murder, describing the event as a "targeted attack." The report details the evidence trail, including security footage of the suspect's movements, the recovery of a high-powered rifle, and messages on the Discord platform that helped lead to his capture.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 12:41:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romania has reported that a Russian drone breached its airspace, making it the second NATO member, after Poland, to experience such an incursion recently. The Romanian defense ministry stated that its F-16 jets were monitoring Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure along the Danube when they tracked the drone, which did not fly over populated areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the incident as an "obvious expansion of the war by Russia," while the EU's foreign policy chief condemned it as an unacceptable breach of sovereignty.

          <p>A British couple, Hayley and Lewis Trow, discovered that taking an extended "gap year" to travel the world with their six-year-old daughter is significantly cheaper than their previous lifestyle in the UK. After quitting their corporate jobs, they found they are saving up to 50% on living costs, with a monthly travel budget of £2,000–£3,000 compared to their former £4,000-£5,000 expenses at home. The family has managed their daughter's education through online tutoring and temporary enrollment in a school in Bali. They emphasize that the decision was driven by a desire for more family time and adventure, trading boardroom meetings for invaluable life experiences.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In an interview with the BBC, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences and that every person involved, regardless of status, should be held to the fullest extent of the law. Despite Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties and reaching an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022, her family feels justice has not been served. They also urged President Trump to release remaining files related to Epstein's network.</p>

However, the most significant development is the surge of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which more than tripled its share of the vote to 16.5% from just 5.1% in 2020. The results are seen as a critical test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition government. The gains for the AfD in a key western German state signal a continuing rightward shift in the country's political landscape, potentially increasing pressure on the ruling coalition in Berlin.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is posing a significant challenge to traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are drawing transactions away from credit cards, thereby reducing key revenue drivers like transaction fees and interest income. A major concern for financial institutions is that BNPL usage is largely invisible on standard credit reports, creating a "giant black hole" in their understanding of a consumer's overall debt and credit risk. This lack of transparency complicates lending decisions as millions of Americans adopt this alternative form of credit.</p>

Kennedy, he cautions that such cycles are far more damaging and self-reinforcing than many realize. Fallows argues that real American life is less fractured than social media portrays and calls on leaders to remind citizens of their common ground. He concludes by invoking Robert F.

While the museum has long housed his most famous work, "Paris Street - Rainy Day," the show highlights Caillebotte's unique focus on male subjects, a departure from the typical landscapes and ballerinas of his contemporaries. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers" and a realistic male nude, were considered scandalous at the time. The exhibition aims to reintegrate Caillebotte into the Impressionist narrative, allowing his sensuous and insightful artistry to be rediscovered by a modern audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law championed by President Trump that makes up to $25,000 in tip income tax-deductible is criticized in this article as a flawed policy that entrenches America's problematic tipping culture. The author argues that the benefits are temporary, expiring in 2028, and exclude many deserving workers like postal carriers and teachers while including questionable categories like "digital content creators" and "self-enrichment teachers." Instead of providing a temporary tax break, the piece advocates for eliminating tipping altogether and mandating that employers pay a living wage. The author suggests the current law is a populist political maneuver rather than a sustainable solution for workers.</p>

          <p>Jon Green, a Democratic county supervisor in Johnson County, Iowa, has announced he will not comply with the Republican governor's order to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the slain right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. While condemning the killing, Green stated he would not grant county honors to a man whose mission was to "denigrate" marginalized communities and harm the nation's political fabric. He contrasted this with the governor's failure to issue similar orders for other victims of political violence, such as a Democratic lawmaker from Minnesota. The decision has drawn both criticism from the governor and support from a fellow supervisor who cited Kirk's divisive rhetoric.</p>

The shooter, Desmond Holly, reportedly posted images of other attackers and tactical gear with extremist symbols on his social media accounts. The ADL highlights these online platforms as a common thread connecting recent acts of school violence, urging for greater awareness of their role in fostering extremist ideologies.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new AI-powered feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short, AI-voiced audio summaries for over a million products. This tool synthesizes information from product descriptions, customer reviews, and other web sources to give shoppers a quick overview, potentially streamlining the decision-making process. While this could enhance accessibility for visually impaired customers, critics raise concerns that the feature may strip the nuance and personal context found in human reviews. There is also a risk that by blending marketing language with user feedback without clear attribution, the AI could unintentionally obscure the line between promotional content and genuine customer experience.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a tragedy that should be unequivocally condemned, the public should not rewrite the reality of his political life. The author criticizes commentators who have posthumously praised Kirk as a practitioner of good-faith debate, asserting that his public appearances were actually trolling affairs designed to humiliate opponents and spread hateful rhetoric. The article contends that an honest accounting of Kirk's career—which included opposing the Civil Rights Act and promoting the "great replacement theory"—is necessary. To condemn political violence, the author concludes, does not require sanitizing the divisive and harmful politics the victim championed in life.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that after two years of war, Israeli society has become dangerously disconnected from the suffering in Gaza, adapting to the conflict as a new normal while Palestinian suffering remains abstract. The author contends that political discourse has been replaced by a mythical language of victimization, framing the conflict as a biblical, zero-sum battle rather than a political problem of occupation. This mindset, combined with a lack of vision for the future, allows for the perpetuation of atrocities. The article suggests that recent international moves to recognize a Palestinian state are a necessary step to break this bubble and re-establish Palestinian rights as a foundation for any future resolution.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear and apprehension following a Supreme Court ruling that permits federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and profile individuals based on appearance. The ruling overturned a temporary restraining order that had slowed sweeping raids in the region, and the Department of Homeland Security has vowed to "flood the zone" with enforcement actions. This has placed undocumented workers in a difficult position, forcing them to choose between risking deportation by going to work or facing eviction by staying home. In response, volunteer groups are increasing their presence in vulnerable areas to monitor agents and inform residents of their rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new "Make Our Children Healthy Again" report is facing criticism for its near-total omission of the words "smoking," "tobacco," and "nicotine." Health advocates and parents find the exclusion alarming, as tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death and youth vaping continues to be a public health concern. Critics, including the former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, argue that a strategy to combat chronic disease without addressing tobacco control is destined to fail. The report's focus on public service campaigns is seen as weak, especially as the administration has recently cut funding for successful tobacco control programs and withdrew a proposed ban on menthol cigarettes.</p>

          <p>In an unconventional preparation strategy, Europe's Ryder Cup golf team is using virtual reality headsets that simulate a hostile crowd by shouting abuse at them. Captain Luke Donald introduced the technology to help players desensitize themselves to the intense environment expected at Bethpage, New York. Rory McIlroy revealed the tactic, explaining that players can have the VR simulation say "whatever you want them to say," allowing them to prepare for the worst-case scenario of heckling from American fans. This innovative approach is part of a detailed effort to help the European team overcome the challenge of playing on U.S. soil, where they have not won since 2012.</p>
