          <p>President Trump has initiated the controversial demolition of the White House's historic East Wing to construct a new, privately-funded $300 million ballroom. This project coincides with significant foreign policy developments, including efforts to expedite the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal with Australia to counter Chinese influence. Trump is also preparing for a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming APEC summit, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions that have led to new tariffs. The week also saw diplomatic engagements with NATO and Ukraine, highlighting a busy period for the administration.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery to remove more than 80 high-powered magnets he had swallowed, leading to the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, purchased online, formed dangerous chains inside his intestines, causing tissue death through pressure necrosis. This case highlights the significant dangers of small, powerful magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys but can cause severe internal injuries if ingested. Despite a ban in New Zealand, these products remain easily accessible online, prompting renewed calls for awareness and stricter enforcement.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard VOO ETF, may be losing favor among some investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated in the technology sector, which now accounts for a record 35% of the index's weight. Consequently, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index outperforming the S&P 500 in recent months. This potential market broadening comes as major tech companies are scheduled to report their latest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reclusive billionaire Timothy Mellon, a major financial backer of Donald Trump, has been identified as the anonymous donor who gave $130 million to the Pentagon to help pay U.S. troops during the government shutdown. The donation, which President Trump had praised without naming the source, has raised legal and ethical questions, as it may violate the Antideficiency Act prohibiting agencies from accepting such funds. Mellon has a history of large political contributions, including over $165 million to support Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur is set against a backdrop of escalating rivalry between the United States and China, forcing member states into a difficult geopolitical balancing act. While the official agenda covers economic integration and security, the underlying tension revolves around trade disputes, territorial claims in the South China Sea, and technological competition. Many Southeast Asian nations are attempting to maintain beneficial relationships with both superpowers, cooperating with the U.S. on security while depending on China for trade and investment. This dynamic makes it increasingly difficult to avoid choosing sides in the great power competition.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU is actively working to end its strategic reliance on rare earth elements imported from China. Beijing's recent export curbs on these critical materials, which are essential for manufacturing everything from electric vehicles to military technology, have caused significant economic damage to some European industries. The EU's strategy involves securing alternative sources through partnerships with countries like Australia and Canada, boosting domestic production and processing, and significantly increasing recycling efforts.

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, who was pardoned by President Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been arrested and charged with making a terroristic threat. He allegedly sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City. This incident highlights concerns about recidivism among the more than 1,500 riot defendants who received clemency, many of whom have been defended by the former president.

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which would allow the Democratic-controlled legislature to redraw congressional districts, is being framed by supporters as a necessary response to Republican gerrymandering in other states like Texas.

This strategy appears to be resonating with California voters, a majority of whom view the measure as a way to counteract Republican efforts to manipulate elections. Polling suggests the visceral opposition to Donald Trump is a key factor driving support for the initiative.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that nearly one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs) among a group of patients in Southern California were caused by E. coli strains linked to contaminated meat from local grocery stores.

The findings suggest that foodborne pathogens are a more significant cause of common infections like UTIs than previously understood, raising concerns about food safety standards.

The act is seen not just as a physical alteration but as a statement that "thumbs its nose at the idea that checks and balances actually work."

          <p>According to Chinese state media, President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team and played a "decisive role" in formulating the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. The reports emphasize the extensive effort and personal oversight Xi dedicated to the process, which was informed by his investigative tours across China throughout the year. This narrative, released after the Communist Party's fourth plenum, is designed to highlight Xi's deep involvement and central authority in shaping China's long-term economic and strategic direction. The framework underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation.</p>

          <p>In a new interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris has strongly indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency, stating that her career in public service is not over. When asked if she could be the next president, she replied "possibly," marking her clearest suggestion yet of a potential 2028 campaign. Harris dismissed current polls that show her with low favorability, noting she has defied polls throughout her career. In the interview, she also criticized former President Trump as a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system and is enabled by business leaders who "capitulate" to him.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize sleep, has created a multi-billion dollar industry of gadgets like smart mattresses, rings, and headbands. However, this reliance on technology introduces new points of failure, as demonstrated when an Amazon Web Services outage caused high-tech Eight Sleep mattresses to malfunction, trapping users in cold, hot, or upright positions. While some sleep tech can be beneficial for specific medical conditions, the broader movement risks over-complicating a natural biological process.

Described as an "underwater phantom," the drone is small, lightweight, and made from a transparent hydrogel material that makes it difficult to detect. Its design allows for near-silent operation and low power consumption, making it ideal for tasks such as observing fragile marine ecosystems, inspecting underwater structures, and conducting covert monitoring. The robot's lifelike appearance and movements represent a significant advancement in biomimetic underwater technology for scientific and potentially military applications.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his mansion in Hunts Point, Seattle, for $63 million, making a significant profit on the property he purchased in 2019 for $37.5 million. This move comes as Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez, have been living primarily in Miami for the past two years. The sale coincides with Bezos gradually reducing his ownership stake in Amazon to below 10%, having sold over 100 million shares in the last year. These financial decisions occur alongside an ongoing legal dispute where Bezos is seeking to have his wife's brother cover legal fees from a past defamation lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, just seven weeks after being sacked from the cabinet by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Her victory over Bridget Phillipson, who was seen as the candidate closer to the party leadership, is viewed as an expression of unease within the party about its current direction and recent series of political missteps. While not a landslide, the result signals a desire for a different voice in the party's senior ranks. Powell's new role creates a potentially awkward dynamic with Starmer as Labour attempts to recover from a period of internal turmoil.</p>

This gap is drawing attention to Berkshire's decision to sell a significant portion of its stake in Apple, its largest holding. Since Berkshire began reducing its position in late 2023, Apple's stock has surged over 50%, meaning the firm has left an estimated $50 billion in potential profits "on the table."

          <p>Modern weddings are increasingly characterized by "wedding sprawl," where celebrations expand into multi-day events with high expectations, placing significant financial and logistical strain on guests and bridal parties. This phenomenon, fueled by social media and cultural aspirations, leads to "bridesmaid inflation," where the duties and costs associated with being in a wedding party become excessive. While many Americans have adjusted their expectations for other life milestones, the dream of a large, elaborate wedding persists. This often results in couples inadvertently burdening their closest friends and family in the pursuit of a perfect day.</p>

The key is to turn boundaries into teachable moments by explaining the reasoning behind them, particularly concerning safety and kindness. Providing children with limited choices can empower them and give them a sense of control, which often leads to greater cooperation. Consistency is crucial, as it helps children feel secure and understand expectations, even when they are upset.
