          <p>Denmark is raising its retirement age to 70, prompting experts to consider whether the U.S. may follow suit, though it could present problems. While Denmark's move signals a desire for people to work longer, retirement experts suggest that raising the U.S. retirement age may not be the same solution due to income, wealth, education, and life expectancy disparities. A policy to raise the retirement age would take time to phase in, and lawmakers need money right now to resolve looming depletion dates for the trust funds it relies on to help pay benefits. The Social Security Administration faces looming depletion dates for the trust funds it relies on to help pay benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawmakers' letter to Governor Newsom urges adherence to the law's original terms. The concerns are directed at the draft regulations' potential approval of polluting recycling technologies and the documentâ€™s expansive exemption for products and packaging that fall under the purview of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

With the state's senior population expected to increase significantly by 2040, there are concerns about who will provide care for those unable to afford it or without family support. The Trump administration's immigration policies, including increased arrests and an end to temporary protected status, have created fear among caregivers and employers.

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has confirmed three new wolf packs in the stateâ€™s far north, bringing the total to ten, which marks a continued resurgence for the protected species. The growing wolf population is welcomed by conservationists, but ranchers are concerned about increasing attacks on livestock. Shasta County has joined other Northern California counties in declaring a state of emergency due to wolves. The state is taking steps to address ranchersâ€™ concerns, including releasing an online map of GPS-collared wolves and exploring harsher methods to haze the animals.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of state parole hearings after nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons yielded false positives between April and July of last year. The review will determine if any inmates were denied parole based on these faulty tests and whether they are owed a new hearing. Representatives at UnCommon Law, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the review involves at least 459 parole hearings. Some advocates are pushing for medical files to not be included in parole hearing decisions.</p>

          <p>Despite advocating for harsher penalties for drug dealers, President Trump has pardoned several convicted drug offenders, including Larry Hoover, who was serving multiple life sentences for crimes linked to the Gangster Disciples. This move has sparked controversy and mixed messages, with some critics questioning the consistency of Trump's drug policy. While Trump's administration expects Illinois officials to release Hoover, he will remain incarcerated due to a state-level murder conviction. Some view Trump's pardons as transactional, influenced by powerful individuals like Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.</p>

The upgrade involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's economic benefits, opponents criticize its high cost and lengthy construction period.</p>
