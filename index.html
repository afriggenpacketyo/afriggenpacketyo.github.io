            <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel to reach the UK has hit a new record for the first four months of the year, surpassing previous highs from 2022 and 2023. Provisional Home Office figures indicate that over 8,000 people have arrived in 2025 so far, with 656 people arriving on Saturday alone. The government insists it has a plan to restore order to the asylum system and dismantle people-smuggling operations, while the opposition criticizes the government's handling of the border situation. The French Coastguard reported rescuing 50 people from boats at sea on Saturday, highlighting the ongoing dangers of these crossings.</p>

            <p>Military planners have been requested to assist Birmingham City Council in tackling the mounting piles of rubbish due to a month-long bin strike by Unite union members over pay disputes. The strike has resulted in approximately 17,000 tonnes of uncollected rubbish, leading the council to declare a major incident. While soldiers won't be collecting rubbish, office-based military personnel will provide logistical support. The government has also provided staff to aid the council with logistics and opened household waste centers in an effort to address public health risks.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are pressing the US to "completely cancel" import taxes as the trade war between the two largest economies persists. Despite a temporary pause on some global tariffs, the US has increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%. China views the tariff exemptions as a "small step" but calls for a full correction of what it deems wrongful practices. The Trump administration, however, hints at imposing separate "semiconductor tariffs" in the future, adding uncertainty to the situation. Tensions remain high, with no immediate plans for talks between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping.</p>

            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping currently have no scheduled communication amidst the ongoing trade war between the two countries. Despite the U.S. imposing tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries and increasing tariffs on Chinese imports, Greer insists that the U.S. is working to reshore American manufacturing. China has responded by raising tariffs on U.S. goods, criticizing the U.S. imposition of levies as a violation of international economic rules. Greer suggests that China chose to retaliate, unlike other countries willing to negotiate.</p>

            <p>Manchester City Women's Football Club is facing a difficult season due to an extensive injury list impacting key players like Vivianne Miedema, Khadija Shaw, and Lauren Hemp. Interim manager Nick Cushing admits the injury crisis needs examination, questioning whether it's due to bad luck or poor practice. Unlike rivals Chelsea, who made significant signings to cover injured stars, City's limited January signings and a loan of Chloe Kelly have raised concerns about squad depth. Former City captain Steph Houghton emphasizes the team's missing experienced players and the need to address the lack of depth.</p>

His lawyer stated that Lacy was crushed under the weight of an irresponsible and prejudiced process, noting the NFL withdrew his draft card based on mere accusations.

He urges finance ministers and central bankers to discuss strengthening the global economy at the upcoming IMF and World Bank meetings.
