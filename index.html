        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K., experts suggest that the U.S.'s 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners. The deal allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing higher duties, while British steel and aluminum industries can export tariff-free. Analysts believe that the deal signals more flexibility on sectoral tariffs but indicates that a 10% baseline tariff will likely remain for other countries. Some analysts warn that the tariffs could negatively impact U.S. economic growth as well.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, during an appearance on ABC's "The View," expressed that he was not surprised by Vice President Kamala Harris's loss in the 2024 presidential election, attributing it to sexism and racism. Biden stated that there was a consistent campaign to undercut the notion that a woman, particularly a woman of mixed race, could lead the country. He also mentioned that he and Harris have a close relationship and communicate frequently, and sidestepped questions about her future political ambitions, though he hopes she stays engaged in politics. Progressive figures have criticized Biden for being in denial about the Democratic party's viability in 2024.</p>

The court also suggested Alabama be subjected to federal preclearance for future districting plans. The Black voters who sued hailed the decision as a victory for voting rights.</p>

Swing district GOP lawmakers oppose proposals that strip benefits, while conservatives demand deep spending cuts. The conflict stems from the need to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the cost of extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts. Potential solutions under consideration include caps on spending, work requirements, and adjusting the Medicaid enrollment period, each with significant implications for coverage and state budgets.</p>
