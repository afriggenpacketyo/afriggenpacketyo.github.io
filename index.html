        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked a massive Black Lives Matter movement, the nation is experiencing a significant backlash, with policies and rhetoric shifting towards "white grievance," particularly under President Trump. While the initial protests saw widespread support across party lines, the current climate reflects a retrenchment, including the removal of Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., and the abandonment of Justice Department oversight agreements for police forces accused of racial bias. Despite this shift, some argue that change is never fully rolled back, and Black activism remains crucial for a robust democracy, though concerns persist about the silencing of voices and a potential return to a "bad square one."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:59:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on creating a secure environment where children feel comfortable expressing their emotions, with the goal of building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents, encouraging them to accept their child's emotions without dismissing them and to view misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parenting involves setting boundaries with empathy, preventing shame, and modeling healthy repair after conflicts, ultimately fostering an environment where children can show up as their full, authentic selves.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU requires until July 9 to finalize a trade deal with the United States, following a "good call" with President Donald Trump. This comes after Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods, later halving it to 10% until July 8 to allow for negotiations, while the EU has also threatened countermeasures against US imports. European leaders are urging a diplomatic resolution to avoid harming both economies, as Trump has long criticized what he views as an unfair trade relationship with the EU.</p>

The incident involved Bramall incorrectly calling a foul against Villa when Morgan Rogers appeared to have legally scored, an error that VAR couldn't overturn due to the whistle being blown before the ball crossed the line. Villa's director of football operations expressed dissatisfaction with Bramall's inexperience for such a crucial match, suggesting more seasoned international referees should have been assigned.</p>

          <p>A quiet funeral was held in Beit Zayit, Israel, for Yaron Lischinsky, who was killed in a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., alongside Sarah Milgrim. The low-profile affair, attended by family, friends, and Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, honored Lischinsky, an Israeli Embassy research assistant known for his peace-seeking efforts. The shooting, carried out by a man who shouted "Free, free Palestine!", has sparked outrage and highlighted rising antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment, while the community mourns the loss of a dedicated patriot and bridge-builder.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Accused of Monetizing the Presidency</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for allegedly monetizing the presidency to an unprecedented extent, with concerns raised about potential conflicts of interest and ethical boundaries being blurred. Examples include Jeff Bezos financing a promotional film about Melania Trump, the Trump family collecting millions from a new cryptocurrency, and Qatar donating a luxury jet for the president's use. Critics argue that these activities normalize what would once have been considered serious ethical violations, while the White House defends the president's actions by claiming he is abiding by applicable conflict of interest laws and that his prior wealth negates any need for additional income.</p>
