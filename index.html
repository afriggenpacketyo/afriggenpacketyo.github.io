          <p>According to the article, manufacturing a 100% American-made vehicle is complex and costly due to the global automotive supply chain. While President Trump pushed for automakers to build in the U.S. through tariffs, experts say sourcing all parts domestically is not feasible. Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that 15% to 20% of parts are currently impossible to source in the U.S. The article suggests that increased costs could price consumers out of the market, leading to lower demand and production.
