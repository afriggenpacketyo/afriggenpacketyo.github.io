          <p>Ferrari is grappling with tyre performance issues, hindering their ability to compete with McLaren in Formula 1, as highlighted after the Miami Grand Prix. Team principal Frederic Vasseur acknowledged that Ferrari's car pace matched Red Bull and Mercedes during the race but was compromised by poor grid positions due to tyre struggles. Small upgrades are expected for the upcoming races in Imola and Monaco, with stricter rules on front wing deflection anticipated to level the playing field in Barcelona.

Experts believe that their agile supply chains and ability to operate on thin margins will allow them to continue offering competitive prices. While prices have risen, many products may still be cheaper than those on American e-commerce sites.</p>

The removal of two defense ministers and several senior People’s Liberation Army officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, indicates internal turmoil and corruption within the military. This situation offers Taiwan and the United States an opportunity to strengthen their defenses, although China's military has made significant advancements and continues to rehearse invasion scenarios.</p>

          <p>A dental practice in Sheffield, Darnall Dental Clinic, is facing financial difficulties and may not be able to continue treating all of its NHS patients due to a loss of funding. Despite taking on an additional 4,000 patients since 2022, the clinic has lost an NHS subsidy, leading to reduced service levels and verbal abuse from patients unable to secure appointments. The clinic invested £466,000 into expanding its premises but is now facing a £544,000 funding loss. Staff members are experiencing increased stress and abuse from frustrated patients.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from receiving new federal grants, citing concerns over antisemitism and criticizing its diversity policies. The Education Department has accused Harvard of failing its "legal obligations," freezing billions of dollars in potential research grants. Harvard has vowed to fight what it calls an "illegal government overreach," arguing that the administration's demands would impose unprecedented control over the university. The move follows similar actions against other universities, including Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

At 17, Yamal has already achieved significant milestones, including winning a European Championship with Spain and a La Liga title with Barcelona. While Yamal is hesitant to compare himself to Messi, his trajectory is outpacing both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at the same age. However, analysts note that reaching Messi's level of success will be a significant challenge.</p>

The lawsuit, filed by Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri, aims to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone, require in-office visits, and restrict its use based on pregnancy stage.</p>

          <p>Germany is still engaged in the painstaking process of searching for and reburying its fallen soldiers from World War II, 80 years after the war's end.

The gestures of remembrance are part of a long, complicated — and sometimes controversial — effort to bring the German dead to rest, 80 years after a war that Nazi Germany started.</p>
