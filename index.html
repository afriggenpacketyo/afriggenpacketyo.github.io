          <h2>Trump Claims Ceasefire Between Israel and Iran, Though Confirmation Lacks</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran on Truth Social, stating it was "now in effect," but neither Israel nor Iran confirmed any such agreement. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested Iran had stopped strikes but denied any ceasefire agreement, adding that the final decision on military operations would be made later. According to a White House official, both sides had agreed to a ceasefire contingent on no further Iranian strikes, brokered with Qatar's help after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base. The conflict began on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks. The article indicates the disagreement between the U.S. intelligence community and Trump regarding Iran's nuclear program, with Trump believing Iran is close to having a nuclear weapon. The Human Rights Activists group reported that at least 950 people have been killed and 3,450 wounded in Israel's strikes in Iran, while Israeli officials claim that Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global equities saw minimal gains as investors considered President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, alongside growing skepticism towards Trump's policy changes. The MSCI World index rose slightly, and U.S. futures also showed marginal increases. Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, attributed the market's muted response to a sense of weariness with Trump's policy shifts and the subdued Iranian reaction to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. Dive noted that previous tariff policy changes had a more significant impact, whereas the market's reaction has been less extreme recently. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities reflects a long-standing debate regarding Tehran's nuclear program, pitting the US intelligence community against Israel and Iran hawks. For two decades, US intelligence has assessed that Iran enriches uranium but hasn't built atomic bombs, leading to disputes over the significance of enrichment versus weaponization. Trump, unlike his predecessors, is more inclined to heed Israel's views and distrusts the CIA, dismissing intelligence assessments that Iran isn't building a bomb. This shift has led to disputes over the importance of changes in Iran's uranium enrichment program, with Democrats expressing concern that Trump acted without new intelligence justifying the action.</p>

          <p>Western airlines may experience greater disruptions than their Chinese counterparts this summer due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel and U.S. military strikes. Most carriers are avoiding flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes, but Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, unlike Chinese companies. Analysts suggest this may widen the competitive gap already existing between Chinese and Western airlines. Flight diversions and cancellations increased after Tehran's missile assault on a U.S. military base in Qatar, with Western firms diverting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, as well as southern routes over Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>Google may be required to make changes to its search services in the UK to promote greater competition, according to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA is investigating Google under a new law that allows the regulator to demand changes if a firm holds excessive power in a market. Google accounts for over 90% of UK searches, with 200,000 businesses relying on the company's search advertising. Google has stated it will cooperate with the CMA but acknowledged the announcement presents challenges to its UK operations.</p>

          <p>The Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in the Hebrides after owning it for 80 years, listing it for £5.5m. The island includes a ruined castle, a working farm, and a holiday accommodation business. The Dowager Viscountess Selby bought the island after World War II, seeking a fresh start for her family. Jim Gully, her grandson, described an idyllic childhood on the island, while Sothebys International Realty suggested the island could become a wellness destination. The castle on the island was built in 1911 by a New Zealand-born adventurer, and its blueprints are believed to have been lost on the Titanic.</p>

          <p>Germany may face tax increases and increased debt as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target. In 2024, Germany spent around 2% of its GDP on defense, which aligns with the current NATO target, but falls short of the proposed 5% goal. Hubertus Bardt of IW Koeln suggests the additional expenses would likely be financed by loans, leading to budget conflicts and potential funding cuts elsewhere. Emilie Hoeslinger of the ifo institute notes that while Germany's new rules allow for debt-financed defense expenditures, higher debt will lead to increased interest costs in the medium term.

Blaze went missing while visiting family in Orange County, California. Sam Woodward, a high school classmate, was the last person to see him and was later arrested. Woodward was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, as prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward killed Blaze because he was gay.

          <p>China has increased control over rare earth exports, leading to global shortages and highlighting industries' dependence on Chinese supply chains. China relies heavily on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for approximately 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar is a key source of dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-tech manufacturing, including defense, aerospace, and renewables. This dependence poses supply chain risks due to the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, particularly in the Kachin State, where most heavy rare earths originate.</p>
