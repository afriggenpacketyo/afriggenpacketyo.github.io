          <p>A public feud erupted between President Trump and Elon Musk after Musk criticized Trump's domestic megabill, leading to a series of insults and accusations exchanged on social media. Trump expressed disappointment in Musk's opposition to the bill, particularly regarding electric vehicle subsidies, while Musk claimed he helped Trump win the election and accused him of ingratitude. The dispute escalated with Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts and Musk alleging Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case. This public falling-out marks a significant shift in their once-close relationship, raising questions about the future of their collaboration and the potential impact on policy decisions. </p>

          <p>The article explores the reasons behind the deteriorating relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk, highlighting the shift from a friendly alliance to a bitter public feud. The conflict stems from Musk's opposition to Trump's legislative agenda, specifically the "big, beautiful bill," which Musk criticizes for increasing the national debt. The article suggests that Musk's motivations may also be tied to his business interests, as the bill rolls back credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. The article also mentions underlying issues, such as disappointment in DOGE, a pulled NASA nominee, and a promised $100 million that didn't materialize. </p>

The court's decision was based on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally shields gunmakers from liability for the misuse of their products by third parties.

          <p>Multiple sources are reporting that Aaron Rodgers is set to sign a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, marking the end of speculation about his future in the NFL. Rodgers, who recently parted ways with the New York Jets, had expressed uncertainty about continuing his career due to personal matters. The Steelers, lacking an established starting quarterback, have been linked to Rodgers for some time. Despite Rodgers's age and recent performance, the Steelers are likely hoping he can bring experience and leadership to the team. </p>

          <p>David Lira, the son-in-law of disgraced lawyer Tom Girardi, pleaded guilty to one count of contempt of court for defying a judge's order regarding the distribution of settlement funds to clients. The case involves funds owed to relatives of victims in a 2018 Indonesian plane crash. Lira admitted to knowing that Girardi did not fully pay the Lion Air clients' settlement funds, violating court orders. The plea agreement did not assert any acts of fraud on the part of Lira, who faces a potential prison sentence. </p>

The new ban, which is set to take effect on June 9, is wider in scope and has clearly defined exemptions, making it more legally robust. Unlike the original ban, the new restrictions do not explicitly target Muslim-majority states.

Mexico had sued seven American gun manufacturers, claiming their products are often sold to gun traffickers who then provide these guns to Mexican drug cartels. The court's decision, based on the PLCAA, grants broad immunity to American gunmakers from lawsuits seeking to hold them liable for harms caused by the misuse of firearms by third parties.
