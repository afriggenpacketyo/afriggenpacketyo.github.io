          <p>West Ham United has appointed former Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract after sacking Graham Potter. The decision comes as the club sits 19th in the Premier League table, having secured only three points from their initial five matches. Nuno, who was recently dismissed by Forest despite guiding them to a high league finish last season, is expected to implement a more stable, counter-attacking style. His appointment aims to restore confidence and improve the team's competitive standing amid recent fan dissatisfaction with on-field performances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Labour party conference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating their policies would "tear this country apart." He specifically condemned Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, labeling it one of the most "shocking" policies he has encountered. Starmer positioned the conference as an opportunity to present Labour's vision of "patriotic national renewal" as a contrast to what he described as Reform's divisive politics. The comments come as Labour faces pressure from opinion polls and internal party debates over policies like the two-child benefit cap.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has summoned hundreds of high-ranking military leaders from around the world to an unusual meeting in Washington, D.C. The purpose of the gathering remains unclear, sparking concern among analysts about the significant security risk of having so many key commanders in one location. The meeting coincides with new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, which critics argue will hinder transparency and public understanding of such major events. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed whether the assembly is part of a broader effort to communicate new expectations to the military leadership.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve was ejected during a Game 3 playoff loss after a heated confrontation with officials over a non-call that led to an injury for her star player, Napheesa Collier. In the final minute, Collier was injured during a steal by an opponent who then scored a game-sealing layup. In a post-game press conference, Reeve delivered a two-minute critique of the league's officiating leadership, calling the crew's assignment to a semifinal game "malpractice." The incident highlights a season of widespread frustration among WNBA players and coaches regarding the inconsistency and physicality of officiating.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and went on to serve in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, overcoming significant racial discrimination to serve with distinction. After retiring from the Air Force in 1971, Hardy became a dedicated advocate for preserving the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>A resilient stock market is currently fueling consumer spending and supporting the U.S. economy, potentially preventing a recession despite concerning indicators like low job growth. This "wealth effect" is largely concentrated among the top 10% of earners who own the majority of stocks, while broader consumer sentiment remains low. Economists warn that this economic stability is precarious, as it is heavily dependent on market performance amid high valuations. A significant downturn in the stock market could quickly erode consumer spending and push the economy into a recession, given the lack of other strong growth drivers. (not investment advice)</p>

This innovative approach was recently demonstrated when Fading West produced 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires, a project coordinated with FEMA.

The author contends that this rhetoric is another form of mom-shaming, placing undue blame on mothers for health outcomes while ignoring other contributing factors.

          <p>Denmark's defense ministry has reported multiple drone sightings over several military facilities, including the country's largest airbase in Karup. This follows a series of similar incidents earlier in the week that temporarily shut down major Danish airports and raised concerns about national security. The unexplained drone activity has also been reported in neighboring Germany and Norway, prompting investigations across the region. While officials have not assigned blame, the incursions have sparked fears of a potential "hybrid attack," with many European nations on high alert amid ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.</p>

          <p>When six-year-old Imani Dell's eyes suddenly became crossed, her mother initially suspected it was from too much screen time. However, when Imani began seeing double, a trip to the emergency room revealed a golf-ball sized tumor in her brain. Surgeons at Holtz Children's Hospital successfully removed the mass, which was identified as a medulloblastoma, a fast-growing cancer common in children. After undergoing 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year, Imani has finished her treatment. She is now recovering and returning to school, with regular scans monitoring for any recurrence.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves adding flavored syrups and cream to soft drinks, is revitalizing the beverage industry after originating in Utah in 2010. Popularized by chains like Swig and amplified by social media, the concept is now being adopted by major corporations including PepsiCo, McDonald's, and Taco Bell. For restaurants, it's an easy menu addition that leverages existing soda fountains, while for beverage companies, it's a way to attract younger consumers and reverse a long-term decline in soda consumption. PepsiCo is set to release ready-to-drink versions, signaling the trend's move from foodservice into the mainstream retail market.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is developing advanced cockpit alerts designed to give pilots critical extra seconds to avoid runway collisions, a growing concern at congested airports. The system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), uses GPS data to provide automated voice and visual warnings like "Traffic on runway!" when a potential conflict is detected. This technology is being tested amid a rise in serious runway incursions, with safety experts urging wider adoption of such systems. While not yet required by regulators, some airlines like Southwest and Alaska have already implemented similar alerts, viewing the investment as a crucial layer of safety.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered their social media photos were used without consent to create explicit deepfake pornography on a "nudify" website, sparking a fight for legal accountability. The case highlights a significant legal loophole, as the creation of such content for personal use without distribution is not illegal in many jurisdictions. The victims, including a law student and a technology consultant, have worked with Minnesota State Senator Erin Maye Quade to introduce a bill that would fine AI companies for enabling these services.

          <p>Broadcast media companies Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," restoring the show to their affiliate stations. The companies had initially pulled the program after host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a move encouraged by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. However, when ABC reinstated Kimmel, the affiliates' continued refusal to air the show proved economically unsustainable, as their replacement programming drew significantly fewer viewers. This standoff highlighted the shifting power dynamics between networks and large affiliate groups, ultimately demonstrating that the network still holds significant leverage through valuable content like live sports.</p>

While some are committed to reconstruction, widespread frustration with insurance delays, financial shortfalls, and the prospect of living in a construction zone for years has led to exhaustion and uncertainty. Many homeowners who initially vowed to rebuild are now reconsidering, weighed down by the emotional and financial toll. Community advocates are pushing for more support from insurance companies and state officials to prevent the recovery from stalling entirely.</p>

          <p>The article revisits the landmark 1977 case involving a neo-Nazi group's plan to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors, to explore the complexities of the First Amendment. The ACLU, represented by Jewish lawyer David Goldberger, defended the group's right to demonstrate, arguing that free speech must be protected even when it is deeply offensive. The courts ultimately sided with this principle, establishing that speech cannot be restricted simply because it is disliked or causes pain. The author suggests this historical precedent remains crucial today, asserting that the principle of free speech is most vital when protecting expression with which we disagree.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's long history of public attacks against former FBI Director James Comey could undermine the federal case brought against him. Comey was recently indicted on charges of making false statements to Congress, a move that followed the installation of a Trump ally as the top prosecutor in the office handling the case. Defense lawyers are expected to argue for dismissal based on selective or vindictive prosecution, using the president's own statements as evidence of political motivation. The unusual circumstances, including internal disagreement among career prosecutors over the charges, may give these legal challenges a higher chance of success.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications could have detrimental effects on the U.S. economy, according to economist Britta Glennon. While the administration argues the policy will encourage companies to hire American workers, Glennon's research indicates that restricting access to high-skill foreign professionals often leads companies to offshore jobs instead. She argues that the exorbitant fee would disproportionately harm startups and universities, reduce U.S. innovation, and make the country less attractive to top global talent. Glennon suggests alternative reforms, such as raising the visa cap and implementing a weighted lottery system. (not investment advice)</p>

The article argues that the memoir reveals a candidate hampered by indecision, such as her choice of Tim Walz as a running mate, whom she later criticizes for a poor debate performance. The book is said to lack coherent policy discussions on key issues like immigration and inflation, instead focusing on the difficult circumstances she inherited. The reviewer concludes that Harris failed to connect with key voter demographics and did not effectively articulate a compelling vision.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump administration officials and allies have increasingly adopted the language of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a charismatic Christian movement. They frame the political landscape as a cosmic battle against evil, with Kirk described as the "first martyr of the third Great Awakening." This rhetoric, which emphasizes combating demonic forces and establishing dominion over society, has spread through churches nationwide and mobilized millions of followers. The movement's leaders have cast Kirk's assassination as a satanic attack, escalating calls for spiritual, if not physical, warfare against their political opponents.</p>

This public health crisis causes irreversible neurological damage and costs the global economy trillions of dollars annually.

For decades, the film's campy, queer-positive narrative has provided a safe space and a sense of community for those who feel like outsiders.
