          <p>Thousands of people participated in a march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson in London, while a smaller counter-protest was held by anti-racism campaigners. Over 1,000 police officers were deployed to maintain order and prevent clashes between the two groups, who held opposing views on issues such as immigration and free speech. The "Unite the Kingdom" rally, organized by Robinson, drew a crowd of approximately 110,000, while the counter-protest attracted around 5,000 participants. The events took place amid ongoing debates in the UK regarding migrants and national identity, with both sides expressing their views through signs and chants. </p>

          <h2>California Considers AI Transparency Bill to Prevent Catastrophic Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 11:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's State Assembly has passed SB 53, a bill requiring transparency reports from developers of powerful AI models, focusing on preventing "catastrophic risks." The bill targets AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini, requiring companies to detail safety frameworks and report critical safety incidents, with penalties for violations. While some argue the bill stifles innovation, proponents believe it's a necessary step to regulate AI before it outpaces oversight, emphasizing prevention over liability. The bill's focus on transparency aims to raise alarms before AI-related catastrophes occur, although its effectiveness in addressing existing AI harms is debated. </p>

The NBA is investigating allegations that the Clippers circumvented salary cap rules by funneling $28 million to Leonard through a "no-show" endorsement deal with Aspiration, a now-bankrupt company partly funded by Ballmer. Ballmer confirmed he introduced the deal to Leonard but denied knowledge of the endorsement contract's details, expressing he was also conned by Aspiration's fraudulent activities.

Critics argued the state rushed to suppress the 'Stop Cop City' movement, violating its own rules.

          <p>Lip oils have gained popularity for their glossy appearance and hydrating properties, but certain ingredients can cause hyperpigmentation. Dr. Rebecca Small advises consumers to focus on ingredients rather than brand names, recommending lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF, linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid. She suggests avoiding fragrances and oleic acids, as these can irritate the lips. If experiencing pain, swelling, or unusual discoloration, it's important to consult a medical professional and discontinue use of the product. </p>

          <p>Nepal's major political parties are demanding President Ram Chandra Poudel reinstate parliament, which he dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. The parties claim the dissolution was unconstitutional and against judicial precedents. President Poudel dissolved the House of Representatives on the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki, a key demand of the protest movement. The protests were triggered by a ban on social media and grew to encompass broader discontent with Nepal's political elite. </p>

          <p>UCLA's football program is under scrutiny after a humiliating defeat to New Mexico, raising questions about the leadership of second-year coach DeShaun Foster.

          <p>Workers at a Montana animal shelter were hospitalized after smoke from methamphetamine being incinerated by the FBI filled the building. The incident occurred because a fan meant to reverse the pressure was not available, causing the smoke to be sucked into the building. Fourteen workers were evacuated, and the shelter's animals were relocated. The shelter will remain closed until it can be tested for contamination, and workers were tested for potential exposure. </p>
