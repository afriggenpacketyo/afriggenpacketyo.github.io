          <p>Former President Donald Trump's lawyers are requesting a judge to compel 94-year-old media executive Rupert Murdoch to be deposed within 15 days. The motion is part of Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Murdoch over a Wall Street Journal article about a letter sent to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's team argues that Murdoch's advanced age and health create a risk he may be unavailable to testify if they wait for the normal legal timeline. The lawsuit centers on a report about a "bawdy" birthday letter Trump allegedly sent to Epstein in 2003.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NPR, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg analyzed the current state of the Democratic Party and its future direction. He addressed what he believes were the party's missteps and outlined strategies for rebuilding public trust. Buttigieg also commented on the challenge of widespread public disbelief in official government narratives, particularly concerning topics like the Jeffrey Epstein files. The discussion focused on the need for Democrats to move beyond the pre-Trump political landscape and connect more effectively with American voters.</p>

The tariffs could also impact the cost of housing, as a significant portion of lumber and other building materials are imported from Canada, which faces potential levies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, two prominent Israeli human rights organizations, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, have publicly accused their own country of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. In a joint report, the groups allege that Israel's actions, including bombing, displacement, and starvation, constitute a "coordinated, deliberate action to destroy Palestinian society." The Israeli government has vehemently denied the charge, calling it baseless and highlighting the 1.9 million tons of aid it has allowed into the territory. The accusation carries significant weight given the term's historical context.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has revealed that she played the entire Euro 2025 tournament with a fractured tibia, an injury she sustained in June. Despite the significant injury to her shin bone, the 33-year-old Chelsea player started in all six of the Lionesses' matches on their way to winning the championship. Medical experts describe the feat as "remarkable," suggesting the injury was likely a stress fracture that was carefully managed by the team's medical staff. Bronze's resilience and pain tolerance were praised by manager Sarina Wiegman as key to the team's success.</p>

          <p>As 92-year-old Paul Biya runs for his eighth term as president of Cameroon, analysts examine the "Biya system" that has kept him in power for over 40 years. Despite widespread poverty, corruption, and a lack of prospects for the youth, Biya maintains control through a complex web of patronage and by skillfully playing potential rivals against each other. The military is structured to prevent any single group from being strong enough to stage a coup, and the political opposition remains fractured. Experts suggest Biya's continued rule ensures stability for the ruling elite who fear losing their privileges.</p>

Key recommendations include staying in air-conditioned spaces, as fans alone do not prevent heat-related illness, and staying well-hydrated with water or electrolyte drinks. It is best to avoid strenuous outdoor activity, especially between noon and 4 p.m. Recognizing the signs of heat exhaustion (heavy sweating, dizziness) and the more dangerous heat stroke (high body temperature, confusion) is crucial for seeking timely medical help.
