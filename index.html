          <p>Following days of unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) reports a surge in families requiring emergency accommodation, with approximately 50 households receiving assistance and 14 families provided with temporary housing. The unrest began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault, escalating into violence that injured 63 police officers over four nights. NIHE chief executive Grainia Long anticipates a further increase in demand for emergency and temporary housing, emphasizing the scarcity of available appropriate housing and concerns about vulnerable households facing exploitation. The NIHE is working to support communities and ensure the safety of residents amidst the ongoing challenges. Optimism is limited given the displacement and underlying social tensions.</p>

          <p>Global markets reacted strongly to Israel's military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, with stocks falling and oil prices surging. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both experienced declines, while U.S. benchmark crude oil increased significantly. The strikes, which Israel stated were the beginning of a multi-day attack, prompted Iran to launch over 100 drones in response, which Israel claimed to have mostly intercepted. The tensions in the Middle East are also affecting markets beyond oil, with declines in Bitcoin prices and a rally in defense stocks. Airline stocks, which are heavily impacted by fuel costs and consumer confidence, experienced sharp losses as a result of the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced a significant expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The proposal, if adopted, would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation, to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. The reauthorization of RECA also includes claims for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers to the list of those eligible for benefits. Hawley hopes this shows the country stands beside those affected by nuclear exposure, offering a measure of vindication and appreciation.</p>

"Jane," testifying under a pseudonym, faced scrutiny over suggestive text messages to Combs and a male escort, Paul. Prosecutors sought to reframe the messages, highlighting Combs' directive to Paul to "persuade her." "Jane" testified that she did not derive physical pleasure from sexual encounters and often faked orgasms. She also expressed jealousy of other women involved with Combs, revealing the emotional toll of their relationship.

          <p>Alexander Dighton, 28, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 22 years for attempting to murder a police officer outside the Talbot Green police station. Dighton, armed with Molotov cocktails and wearing body armor, carried out the attack in January, injuring several officers. The court heard that Dighton was motivated by anti-government ideology, with journals found at his home containing anti-immigrant views and dissatisfaction with the British government. Despite being interviewed by counter-terrorism police a year prior, Dighton was not deemed a threat. The judge emphasized the terrorist connections of the crimes, highlighting Dighton's targeting of the police as a keystone of government power.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongly deported and then returned to the United States, has been arraigned in Nashville on charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Federal prosecutors allege that Garcia, a purported member of MS-13, conspired with others to bring migrants from Latin America into the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. Garcia's lawyers accuse the Trump administration of abusing its power in his return, while prosecutors argue that he poses a danger to the community and is a flight risk. The case has drawn attention due to Garcia's initial deportation and subsequent legal battles.</p>

          <p>Israel's strikes on Iran have sent shockwaves through global financial markets, particularly affecting oil prices, which surged by 7%. Experts warn that this could lead to higher energy prices, impacting everything from petrol and food to travel expenses. The main concerns revolve around the duration of the conflict, the potential involvement of other countries, and disruptions to shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical route for a fifth of the world's oil production. While the situation is significant, the impact may not be as severe as the Ukraine conflict due to current economic conditions and the capacity of oil producers to increase supply.

While Iranian authorities confirmed the Natanz enrichment site was impacted, they reported no elevated radiation levels and stated that the Esfahan and Fordow sites were not affected.

          <p>Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS made their U.S. public market debut, opening at $13.65 a share, valuing the company at roughly $30 billion. JBS operates a sprawling business worldwide, with significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia, and owns more than 80% of Pilgrim's Pride. The company's U.S. listing comes after more than 15 years of planning, but it has been marred by a history of corruption and bribery allegations. Despite opposition from lawmakers, the SEC approved JBS's request to list on the New York Stock Exchange in April. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychological research suggests that far-right narratives about social breakdown could lead to increased support for authoritarianism, not less. President Trump has compared images of the LA protests to a "foreign invasion" and deployed the National Guard. Critics argue that Trump is manufacturing a crisis for political gain, and studies indicate that people who perceive society as unstable are more likely to favor authoritarian leaders who promise order. Reducing people's sense of fear and insecurity, as well as better communication on the meaning and purpose of politics, may help counteract the appetite for authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals how young women, mainly from Africa, are being exploited in Russia's war factories, assembling cheap drones under poor conditions. The Alabuga Start program, named after an industrial area in southwestern Russia, lures female applicants from poorer countries with the prospect of a well-paid career. However, many find themselves in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone (SEZ) assembling Geran-2 drones, which are based on the Iranian-made Shahed 136 and play a key role in attacks on Ukraine. The young women are exposed to dangerous chemicals and face exploitative working conditions, with some parents in Zimbabwe reporting their daughters are under surveillance and have had their passports withheld.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, Hezbollah, once Iran's best equipped and biggest militia group in the region, issued a statement condemning the attack but did not offer to join in the retaliation. Experts suggest that Hezbollah could be waiting for a clear call to action from Iran, or that the group is prioritizing internal restructuring and local arms production. The group may also be too weak to attack due to major losses during last year's war with Israel. Growing pressure on Hezbollah from both Lebanon's government and international calls for disarmament further complicate the situation.</p>
