          <p>Russia conducted a massive overnight assault on Ukraine, deploying over 300 drones and more than 30 missiles across ten different regions. The attacks resulted in at least one fatality and several injuries in Odesa, where a residential building was hit. Critical infrastructure was also damaged in Sumy and Pavlohrad, causing power outages and further destruction. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the ongoing nature of the attack, with rescue operations underway as aerial threats persisted.</p>

Dozens of vessels from around the globe are participating in the four-day festival, which includes musical performances by bands like Deacon Blue and Kaiser Chiefs. Despite the festive atmosphere, organizers are monitoring a yellow weather warning for heavy rain.

          <p>Slovenia's parliament has passed a law legalizing medically-assisted suicide for terminally-ill adults, marking a significant policy shift in Eastern Europe. The legislation, approved with a 50-34 vote, follows a referendum where 55% of voters supported the right to end-of-life autonomy. The law applies to mentally competent adults with unbearable suffering and no prospect of improvement, excluding those with only mental illnesses. While hailed as a compassionate step, implementation is pending as procedures are finalized, and opposition groups have pledged to challenge the measure.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans whose personal details were leaked in a February 2022 data breach are not expected to receive compensation from the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD). The MoD stated it will "robustly defend against any legal action," citing a review that concluded it was "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted by the Taliban solely for being on the leaked list. Despite this, affected Afghans and their families express fear for their safety, with some now in hiding. The leak exposed the details of over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation to the UK.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being viewed as a significant moment for Muslim and South Asian American political representation. His campaign, which focused on issues like affordability and Palestinian rights, mobilized a diverse coalition of voters, including working-class immigrant communities. Mamdani's rise has been met with both widespread support from Muslims nationwide and Islamophobic attacks from political opponents. His success challenges long-standing assumptions about who can represent a major American city, reflecting broader shifts within the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from injury, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite the team's defeat, Glasnow's outing was a positive development, showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective control. The pitcher has been working on a simplified, more athletic approach on the mound to overcome the physical and mental issues that have plagued his career. His successful return is a crucial step for the Dodgers, who are counting on him to bolster their starting rotation for the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>Scott Morrison, the former prime minister of Australia, is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China next week. The hearing will focus on countering what is described as China's "economic coercion against democracies." Morrison's government faced significant trade pressure from Beijing, including tariffs on key commodities, after calling for an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 in 2020. His testimony comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, has been working to warm diplomatic and trade relations with China.</p>

          <p>The United States has enacted the GENIUS Act, a new law establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, which could pave the way for wider use of these dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies in payments. The legislation, signed by President Trump, requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets and is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long sought legitimacy. Proponents believe the law will reinforce the U.S. dollar's global status, while critics argue it lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study from Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, can sometimes awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings help explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis despite successful initial treatment. The research team also identified specific drugs that, when used with chemotherapy in mice, could inhibit this process. A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with breast cancer patients to explore strategies for improving treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew. The restrictions were imposed due to fears he might flee the country while on trial for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn the 2023 election results. The order also bans him from social media and from communicating with his son and foreign diplomats. The case has drawn international attention, with U.S. President Trump calling it a "witch hunt" and threatening tariffs on Brazil.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and its reporters over an article about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit stems from a report detailing a sexually suggestive letter allegedly sent by Trump to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, while the newspaper has expressed full confidence in its reporting and stated it will vigorously defend against the suit. The legal action comes amid renewed scrutiny of the Epstein case and pressure on the Justice Department to release related documents.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced it is shutting down its primary scientific division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a major reorganization. The move is expected to impact hundreds of scientists and researchers and will result in savings of $748.8 million, according to the agency. The ORD conducts critical research on environmental pollutants to protect human health. Critics, including a former EPA official, argue the cuts dismantle a respected research organization and will leave the public more vulnerable to pollution by shifting costs to communities and hospitals.</p>

          <p>China's central disciplinary authorities are using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City" project, which was intended to be a major health tourism hub, was plagued by poor decisions and a broken capital chain, leaving it largely abandoned. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection condemned the project as a "severe waste of resources" and a case of local officials making "blind decisions." The high-profile shaming serves as a warning to other local governments across China to avoid similar vanity projects that are out of touch with reality.</p>

          <p>Scientists at a Chinese army university have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, a world first, has been limited by its power, capping projectile weight and effectiveness for warfare. The new concept involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would significantly increase bore pressure and allow for much heavier projectiles to be fired at hypersonic speeds. The researchers state this advancement is necessary to overcome the current weapon's limitations and enhance the military application of electromagnetic technology.</p>
