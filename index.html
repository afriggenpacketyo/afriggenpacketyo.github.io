          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock increase by 5% after the company significantly raised its long-term financial outlook during an analyst meeting. The computer manufacturer now anticipates annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, up from a previous forecast of 3% to 4%. This optimistic revision is driven by strong customer demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, where Dell positions itself as a key solutions leader. The company, a major customer of Nvidia, is capitalizing on the AI boom to fuel its growth and shareholder returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached a historic milestone, trading at over $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever as investors sought refuge from market instability. The surge, representing a more than 50% gain this year, is attributed to geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, and persistent inflation. Both central banks and retail investors are increasing their holdings to hedge against risks like U.S. sanctions and to protect their assets' value. However, some analysts, like those at Bank of America, are advising caution, warning that the precious metal's rapid ascent could lead to a correction. (not investment advice)</p>

Key topics will include allegations of the Justice Department's 'weaponization' against political opponents of Donald Trump and the administration's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The hearing follows a tumultuous period for the DOJ, marked by controversial indictments and the removal of career officials, prompting accusations of politically motivated actions. Nearly 300 former DOJ employees have publicly condemned Bondi's leadership, citing a loss of independence from the White House.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court to Hear Case on Colorado's Ban of Conversion Therapy for Minors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:30:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding Colorado's 2019 law that prohibits licensed mental health professionals from performing 'conversion therapy' on minors. The challenge comes from a Christian counselor, Kaley Chiles, who argues the ban infringes on her free speech rights by censoring conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity with her young clients. Colorado officials defend the law as a regulation of professional conduct designed to protect minors from a practice widely deemed harmful and ineffective by major medical associations. The case's outcome could have significant implications for state-level regulation of healthcare practices across the country.</p>

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on a Sacramento freeway, leaving its three crew members with critical injuries. The aircraft, operated by REACH, was returning from a hospital transport when it experienced an in-air emergency and went down on Highway 50. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the incident, a fact one fire captain described as 'mind blowing.' Bystanders assisted first responders in lifting the wreckage to free a trapped crew member, and the National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, an upcoming military pay date on October 15 is being viewed as a critical deadline that could compel Congress and the White House to reach a compromise. Analysts suggest that the political fallout from failing to pay 1.3 million active-duty service members might be too great for either side to bear. While prediction markets indicate low confidence in a swift resolution, the potential public anger over missed paychecks could pressure lawmakers into passing at least a temporary funding bill. If this deadline passes without a deal, concerns grow that the stalemate could extend for a prolonged period. (not investment advice)</p>

His comments have drawn condemnation from political opponents, including Labour's West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker, who labeled them as racist.

          <p>Current national average mortgage rates are hovering around 6.34% for a 30-year loan and 5.64% for a 15-year term, presenting challenges for prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. While rates are higher than in recent years, experts suggest that a potential pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hikes could bring some relief to borrowers. To secure the best possible rates in the current environment, financial advisors recommend that applicants strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s. It is also crucial for borrowers to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the outlook for 2026 is less positive, with the WTO slashing its growth prediction from 1.8% to just 0.5%.

          <p>Glenn Medical Center, the only hospital serving 28,000 residents in a rural Northern California county, has been forced to close after 75 years. The closure was triggered by the federal government's decision to revoke its 'critical access' designation, a status that provides enhanced funding to ensure healthcare in remote areas. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) determined the hospital no longer met the required 35-mile distance from the nearest facility, a calculation local officials dispute. The shutdown leaves a significant healthcare gap, forcing residents to travel over 30 miles for emergency services and highlighting the fragility of rural healthcare systems across the U.S.</p>

Their work in the 1980s on electrical circuits demonstrated phenomena like 'macroscopic quantum tunnelling,' which has become a foundational principle for building today's powerful quantum computers. The Nobel committee highlighted that their discoveries are essential to the development of quantum technology, which underpins many modern devices.

          <p>In the absence of official government data due to the shutdown, investment firm Carlyle Group released an analysis from its portfolio companies suggesting U.S. employment growth was nearly flat in September.

This report aligns with other private-sector data, such as ADP's, which also showed a decline in hiring. While Carlyle's data points to a cooling labor market, it also indicated underlying GDP growth was a solid 2.7%. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Bill Newlands noted that consumer concern about the economy remains high, particularly among Hispanic consumers who have shown reduced demand.
