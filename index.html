He assured that a comprehensive range of policy tools will be used to maintain ample liquidity. The statement was made at a conference that highlighted China's financial sector achievements over the past five years, which has reportedly increased the attractiveness of Chinese assets for overseas investors. This approach emphasizes stability and responsiveness to internal economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a Florida golf course, is representing himself in federal court and plans a brief defense. After prosecutors presented their case over seven days with 38 witnesses, Routh indicated he will call only three witnesses, including a firearms expert. Routh has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, and the trial is proceeding faster than anticipated due to his concise cross-examinations. The judge expects closing arguments to begin Tuesday, after which the jury will deliberate on the case.</p>

Hayat, who pleaded not guilty, was arrested in June for allegedly shooting Yousuf after she rejected his friendship proposals. Yousuf was known for promoting traditional Chitrali culture and advocating for girls' education on her popular social media channel. The case has drawn widespread condemnation and highlights the pervasive issue of violence against women in Pakistan, where attacks following rejected proposals are not uncommon.</p>

          <p>Shares for German luxury car manufacturer Porsche dropped over 8% after the company reduced its 2025 profitability forecast and announced delays for new electric models due to weak demand. The news also negatively impacted Volkswagen, Porsche's largest shareholder, whose stock fell by nearly 8%. This downturn in the auto sector contributed to a slight decline in the broader pan-European Stoxx 600 index. The market activity occurred as investors also monitored the Trump administration's new, significantly higher application fee for H-1B visas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government says will create thousands of jobs and boost economic growth. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While proponents champion the investment and increased travel options, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups like Greenpeace and the Green Party, who have condemned it as a "disaster for the climate crisis" due to increased emissions and noise pollution.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has announced a policy proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for migrants, a key pathway to British citizenship. Under the plan, ILR would be replaced with visas requiring reapplication every five years with stricter criteria, including higher salary and English language thresholds. The party claims the policy would save the UK over £234 billion and bring it in line with countries like the US and UAE. Critics, including the Liberal Democrats, argue the proposals are "not serious" and would cause economic disarray by disrupting businesses and losing tax revenues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to increase the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000 has created a potential opportunity for other countries to attract top global talent. Experts suggest that as the U.S. becomes more restrictive, global hubs in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia could benefit by opening their doors to skilled workers. The move is part of a broader push to protect American jobs, but critics argue it could harm U.S. innovation. In contrast, the U.K. is reportedly considering abolishing some visa fees for top professionals to position itself as a "talent magnet." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, influential climate author and activist Bill McKibben expressed significant optimism about the future of clean energy. He argues that the rapid, global proliferation of cheap solar and wind power has created a powerful economic momentum that can withstand political opposition, such as that from a potential Trump administration. McKibben points to the fact that renewables are now the world's cheapest energy sources, highlighting how states like Texas are installing them faster than California due to their tangible local benefits. He believes this economic reality is fundamentally changing the politics of energy, creating a plausible path to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.</p>

The plan, announced at the party's autumn conference, also includes a two-hour daily cap on accessing short-form video content for users under 18. Citing research linking excessive social media use to anxiety and sleep disruption, the party argues that these platforms pose well-documented risks similar to tobacco and alcohol.

This act of obliteration shifts the focus from the victim to the mob and the surrounding context, forcing the viewer to confront the societal dynamics of such atrocities. The review praises the work for its pressing relevance and its power to transform identity from an answer into a question.</p>

          <p>Patricia Lockwood's new autofiction novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," explores the lingering, mind-altering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic through its protagonist, a writer struggling with long COVID. The book uses an expressionistic and associative style to depict the main character's experience with brain fog, intrusive thoughts, and hallucinations while quarantining in Savannah, Georgia. The review notes that while the narrative can feel disjointed and self-indulgent at times, it also contains moments of startling beauty and effectively illuminates the disorienting reality of long COVID. The novel is described as a mixed bag, offering an experimental portrait of a personal health crisis.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is aggressively trying to recruit experienced local law enforcement officers, but is facing significant challenges in California. Despite offering large signing bonuses and six-figure salaries, the federal agency is struggling to compete with the high compensation offered by many local police departments in the state. For example, entry-level pay in San Francisco is close to $120,000, often exceeding what ICE can offer. This dynamic highlights the broader recruitment and retention struggles facing law enforcement agencies nationwide, as ICE's poaching efforts add another layer of competition for a limited pool of qualified officers.</p>

          <p>Following January's devastating Eaton and Palisades fires in Southern California, a historically fast federal cleanup operation has cleared nearly 12,000 properties. However, experts and residents are now concerned that the emphasis on speed may have compromised safety. Federal officials did not conduct soil testing, citing time constraints, but subsequent independent sampling has found elevated levels of toxic metals, including lead, at nearly half of the tested properties that had already been cleared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This has shifted the burden onto homeowners to ensure their properties are safe before rebuilding.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that kindergarteners are the most frequently absent students in California, a trend that can have long-term negative effects on literacy and educational success. Chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% of school days, remains a significant issue, with 26% of the state's transitional kindergarten and kindergarten students being chronically absent in the 2023-24 school year. In Los Angeles Unified School District, the rate for Latino children in these grades was nearly one in three. Parent focus groups cited illness, chronic health conditions, and a difficult transition into the school environment as primary reasons for the absences.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials are refusing to release a preliminary seismic safety report for the Gas Co. Tower, a downtown skyscraper the county recently purchased for $200 million. This decision leaves the public and employees in the dark about the building's potential vulnerability in a major earthquake. Some structural engineers are concerned that the tower, a type of steel-moment-frame building known to have issues, could be rendered unusable after a large quake. The Board of Supervisors has suspended work on a potential $230 million retrofit, citing financial constraints, while insisting the building already exceeds safety requirements.</p>

          <p>Tangier Island, a small, inhabited island in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay, is at risk of being completely submerged within the next 50 years due to rapid land loss from erosion and sea level rise. Since 1850, the island has lost two-thirds of its landmass, and its population, largely descended from original colonial settlers, has dwindled to 240. Climate change is accelerating the crisis by causing higher sea levels and more intense storms, while the entire region is also sinking tectonically. Despite the dire predictions and some federal funding, residents and experts feel the response has been too slow to save the unique culture and way of life.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved an experimental device that treats rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating the vagus nerve. The implant, made by SetPoint Medical, is for patients whose symptoms are not controlled by medication. It works by sending electrical pulses to the vagus nerve for one minute each day, which signals the brain to instruct the spleen to reduce the production of inflammatory proteins. A clinical trial showed that 35% of patients in a difficult-to-treat group saw meaningful improvement, offering a new therapeutic option for this debilitating autoimmune disease.</p>

          <p>The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has confirmed that a ransomware attack is responsible for major disruptions at several of Europe's busiest airports, including London Heathrow and Brussels. The attack targeted software from U.S. maker Collins Aerospace, scrambling automatic check-in and boarding systems and forcing airlines to use manual workarounds. The incident has led to continued delays and flight cancellations as recovery efforts are ongoing. An internal memo from Heathrow suggests the hackers may have remained in the system even after an initial relaunch, complicating the restoration process.</p>
