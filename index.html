          <p>President Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles following violent clashes between protesters and authorities over immigration enforcement. Approximately 300 National Guard soldiers are on the ground to ensure the safety and protection of federal property and personnel. Secretary of Defense Hegseth threatened to send in active duty Marines, while House Speaker Johnson supported Trump's decision. The LAPD reported arrests and the use of tear gas to disperse crowds, while ICE defended its operations, blaming local officials for a slow response. The situation has sparked a debate over federal intervention and states' rights, with Governor Newsom calling the move inflammatory and unnecessary. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on the appropriate response. </p>

          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia, causing alarm among residents in cities like Bogota, Medellin, and Cali. The shallow quake, centered near Paratebueno, prompted people to evacuate buildings, though initial reports indicated no significant damage. The Colombian Geological Service reported several aftershocks following the initial tremor. Colombia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region prone to seismic activity, which makes this event a somber reminder of the country's geographic reality. The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management is assessing the situation in various municipalities to ensure citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Costco has introduced a new frozen strawberry lemonade at its food courts, sparking varied reactions from members. The drink, priced at $2.99, boasts real fruit and no artificial flavors or colors, but some customers find it too tart or sweet. While some reviewers praise the drink as refreshing, others express disappointment, with some longing for the return of the previous strawberry banana smoothie or even the churro. One customer even had to use a blender to make the drink drinkable due to fruit chunks getting stuck in the straw, indicating a potential quality control issue. This new beverage is the latest in a series of food court changes at Costco, including the revival of the combo pizza in calzone form and the replacement of Pepsi products with Coca-Cola. </p>

          <p>Enrique Anaya, a constitutional lawyer and vocal critic of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, has been arrested on charges of money laundering. Human rights organizations have condemned the arrest, viewing it as an attempt to silence dissent against Bukele's administration. Anaya, who has described Bukele as a "dictator," was apprehended at his home in Santa Tecla. The arrest follows similar actions against other critics, raising concerns about diminishing civil liberties in El Salvador. Bukele has defended his actions, stating he would rather be called a dictator than see Salvadorans killed in the streets, which further underscores the tension between his administration and its critics.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein's book, "Abundance," has ignited debate within the Democratic Party, with some viewing it as a potential savior and others as a threat. The book advocates focusing on increasing the supply of essential goods and services, but has faced criticism from anti-corporate populists who prioritize addressing concentrated power. The debate highlights a fundamental disagreement within the party regarding the core problems facing America, as some believe bottlenecks in production are the primary issue, while others emphasize the dominance of large corporations. A poll commissioned by a leftist advocacy group found that voters were more concerned with corporate power than production bottlenecks, revealing a key challenge for Democrats as they seek to unify their message after recent political setbacks. The party's future direction hinges on which critiques gain prominence in its reimagining.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to multiple brown organic and brown cage-free egg brands has sickened dozens of individuals across seven states. Health officials have traced the outbreak to eggs distributed to grocery stores, prompting a recall of approximately 1.7 million eggs by the August Egg Company. Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and stomach cramps, with young children, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems facing the greatest risk. Consumers are advised to discard or return recalled eggs and disinfect any surfaces they may have contacted. The recall is the most recent in a series of salmonella-related outbreaks involving food, including tomatoes and cucumbers, highlighting ongoing concerns about food safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests has drawn criticism and fueled tensions. Despite the LAPD's assessment that protests were largely peaceful, the Trump administration cited concerns over attacks on immigration agents and a slow local response. Over California Governor Newsom's objections, Trump federalized 2,000 National Guard soldiers, with potential deployment of active duty Marines. The move has been interpreted as a political statement and an infringement on states' rights. The rapid escalation and federal government's unwillingness to defer to local authorities have raised questions about the administration's intentions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles as the most frequent causes of conflict in relationships. A sour tone can signal contempt, a major predictor of divorce, while family disagreements often stem from unmet needs or value clashes. Arguments over chores frequently reflect an unequal distribution of labor and a lack of acknowledgment for the invisible load. Ineffective communication can escalate minor issues into major fights, but the psychologist suggests strategies for moving past these issues, such as naming the effect of a condescending tone, reassuring one another in family disputes, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated word or phrase to signal a time-out during heated conversations. By understanding the underlying psychology behind these conflicts, couples can take steps to improve their communication and strengthen their relationships.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests has ignited controversy over the use of federal power.

Local officials have expressed concern that the heavy-handed response risks escalating tensions and infringing on states' rights. Vice President Vance defended the action, framing the anti-ICE protesters as "insurrectionists."

The move is reminiscent of Trump's use of national guard troops during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, raising concerns about the suppression of dissent. California Governor Newsom has condemned the deployment as a spectacle, while White House officials have defended it as necessary to address lawlessness. The situation has sparked debate about the appropriate response to protests and the potential for the erosion of civil liberties.</p>
