            <p>Researchers have developed an experimental drug, lepodisiran, that nearly eliminates lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a), a genetically determined cholesterol-like particle that elevates the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The study, involving 320 participants across multiple countries, demonstrated that the drug could reduce Lp(a) levels by almost 100% with few safety concerns. While lifestyle changes and statins don't affect Lp(a) levels, this new drug offers a potential treatment for the millions worldwide with elevated Lp(a). A phase 3 trial is underway to confirm whether reducing Lp(a) translates to lower rates of heart attack and stroke. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Despite a recent downturn in Pfizer's stock price, analysts suggest it may be a worthwhile investment due to the company's strong manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and its decreasing reliance on coronavirus product revenue. With potential tariffs looming, Pfizer's extensive U.S.-based manufacturing network provides a competitive advantage by allowing it to shift production domestically and avoid tariffs. The company's CEO highlights Pfizer's capacity to produce blockbuster products, positioning it favorably even if tariffs persist. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's reversal on tariffs has sparked confusion and uncertainty, leading economists to question his dealmaking abilities and the long-term economic impact of his policies. While the pause on tariffs provides temporary relief, it raises concerns about the reliability of trade agreements and the potential for future disruptions. The erratic policymaking is causing businesses and consumers to adjust their spending and investment decisions, contributing to fears of stagflation and a potential recession. The US is now charging a tariff of 145% on Chinese exports, and China is charging a tariff of 125% on US exports.</p>
