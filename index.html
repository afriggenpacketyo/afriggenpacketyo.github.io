          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, the highest in more than two years, driven by surging rice prices. This increase comes as the Bank of Japan considers pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. The core inflation figure exceeded expectations, rising from 3.2% in the previous month, while headline inflation remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to lower rice prices, staking his job on the line, amid concerns about the rising cost of living.</p>
