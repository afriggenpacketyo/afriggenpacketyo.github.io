          <p>Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has stepped down, and his Social Democrat party is exiting the government following the success of right-wing nationalist George Simion in the first round of the presidential election. Simion, a eurosceptic, garnered 40.9% of the vote and is expected to win the runoff. Ciolacu cited the coalition's failure to meet its objectives as the reason for the resignation, creating political instability in the EU state. Simion's likely victory is causing concern in European capitals due to his opposition to supplying weapons to Ukraine and his desire for an EU of sovereign nations.</p>

Alcatraz, a former maximum-security prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs and now operates as a popular tourist site within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted student loans, ending a nearly five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent analysis reveals that delinquency rates among student loan borrowers are at an all-time high, with approximately 20% at risk of defaulting. Borrowers in default may face wage garnishment and reduced Social Security benefits, and face damage to their credit scores. Experts recommend income-driven repayment plans and better outreach to borrowers to minimize defaults.</p>

          <p>Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration's decision to suspend leasing and permitting of new wind projects. The states argue that the pause threatens the wind industry and a key source of clean energy. The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring the indefinite pause unlawful and barring agencies from implementing Trump's directive, which was announced on his first day back in office.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on foreign films has ignited a debate about the state of Hollywood and the global movie business. While Trump claims Hollywood is "dying," industry analysts point to recent box office rebounds, but acknowledge the challenges posed by streaming platforms and production costs. The potential impact of the tariffs on American film companies producing films abroad and on co-productions remains unclear, and the UK government has expressed concern about the potential impact on its film industry.</p>
