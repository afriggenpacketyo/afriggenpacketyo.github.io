          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced its plan to shift its primary listing to the United States, a setback for the London Stock Exchange. The company's full-year earnings statement revealed a move towards a dual listing, with the main hub relocating to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This would enable Wise shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, as stated in their earnings announcement. Shares of Wise experienced a surge, trading almost 11% higher following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House's directive marks a significant escalation, instructing the Justice Department to formally investigate Biden's actions.

The proclamation directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of foreign students already in the U.S. studying at Harvard. Trump claimed that Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has "extensive entanglements with foreign countries," and has discriminated in its admissions practices.</p>

The MPs performed the haka in response to a bill seeking to redefine the country's founding treaty with Māori people.

          <p>Brian Colbert has made history as the first Black supervisor in Marin County's 175-year history. Colbert focused his campaign on local concerns such as wildfire prevention, disaster preparedness, and flood control, rather than emphasizing race. Colbert's upbringing and experiences have shaped his perspective, particularly regarding civil rights and equality. He aims to address municipal issues like housing, traffic, and government accessibility, while also acknowledging the significance of his election as a precedent.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering policy changes to protect the state insurance program for high-risk homes following devastating wildfires. AB 226, sponsored by Assemblymembers Lisa Calderon and David A. Alvarez, would make the FAIR Plan eligible for state loans and bonds to avoid financial collapse after a disaster. Other wildfire-related bills aim to protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline claims processes, and offer financial protections for disaster victims. Lawmakers approved $2.5 billion in wildfire aid after the Palisades and Eaton fires, signaling a bipartisan approach to disaster relief.</p>

          <p>The Glendale City Jail is housing immigrants detained by federal agents, under a long-standing contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This makes Glendale one of the few known jurisdictions in California to sidestep rules prohibiting local law enforcement from assisting in federal immigration enforcement. The city council defends the detentions, citing an 18-year-old contract to temporarily house noncriminal detainees, claiming it complies with state sanctuary laws. Advocates fear that Glendale's arrangement exploits a loophole in state sanctuary laws, raising concerns amid increased enforcement efforts by the Trump administration.</p>

It highlights methodological issues in studies claiming a "China shock" and points out that the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China's WTO entry. The author concludes that the real "shock" America faces is the resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese man detained in connection with the murders of two Japanese nationals in Dalian was reportedly involved in a financial dispute with the victims. The victims were his business partners, and the dispute allegedly centered around the purchase of a hot spring hotel near Mt. Fuji. The suspect, who founded a real estate company in Tokyo, may have failed to pay his Japanese partners, leading to the conflict. The two Japanese nationals were killed on May 23 in a Dalian village.</p>
