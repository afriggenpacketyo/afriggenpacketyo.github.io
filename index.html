          <p>Despite a recent feud, President Trump may find it difficult to cut ties with Elon Musk due to SpaceX's dominance in space launch capabilities and the U.S.'s reliance on the company for space-related projects. Canceling Musk's contracts would be challenging, particularly if Trump wants to pursue ambitious goals like the Golden Dome missile defense project. The US military and NASA heavily rely on SpaceX for satellite launches, astronaut transport, and lunar missions. The article highlights the strategic importance of SpaceX and the limitations Trump faces in severing the relationship. The optimism score is 55.</p>
