          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook can continue in her role, denying an immediate removal request from the Trump administration. The court has scheduled arguments for January to hear the full case regarding the president's authority to fire a Fed governor "for cause." President Trump sought to remove Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, while Cook argues the move is politically motivated due to her monetary policy stances. This decision allows her to participate in at least two more interest rate votes.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Mexico has strongly criticized comments made by a U.S. diplomat urging Mexico to help reduce dependence on Chinese semiconductor chips. The embassy accused the United States of imposing geopolitical competition, erecting trade barriers, and practicing economic bullying under the guise of supply chain security. The statement was in response to remarks by Mark Johnson, the chargé d’affaires at the U.S. embassy, who stated that Washington would not tolerate dependence on critical technologies from China. This exchange highlights the ongoing technological and economic tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition at the Palazzo Tarasconi in Parma, Italy, was raided by police after the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation reported that several pieces on display were forgeries. The Italian carabinieri's art squad seized 21 suspected fakes, including tapestries and drawings, from the "Salvador Dalí, Between Art and Myth" exhibit. Salvador Dalí is known to be one of the most frequently forged artists in the world, alongside Pablo Picasso. The incident underscores the pervasive issue of counterfeit art circulating in the market, with some experts estimating that over half of all art may be forged or misattributed.</p>

          <p>German federal prosecutors have announced the arrest of three suspected members of Hamas for allegedly planning attacks on Israeli and Jewish institutions within Germany. The individuals, two German citizens and one Lebanese-born man, were apprehended in Berlin during what was reportedly a weapons handover. Authorities stated the men had been procuring firearms, including an AK-47, since the summer to carry out assassination attacks. The arrests highlight ongoing concerns about terrorist threats in Europe and the operational activities of groups like Hamas on the continent.</p>

          <p>Two hurricanes, Humberto and Imelda, are swirling in close proximity in the Atlantic, raising the possibility of a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While a full merger is unlikely, experts note that Humberto's presence has already influenced Imelda's trajectory, possibly steering it away from the U.S. mainland. The interaction between the storms is creating dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast, posing a significant threat to coastal areas.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced a significant price increase for its top-tier gaming subscription, with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate rising by $10 to $29.99 per month. The company is also restructuring its other plans, rolling the 'Core' tier into the 'Essential' tier while upgrading 'Standard' subscribers to 'Premium'. This move aims to deliver more value, including access to over 400 games and the addition of the Ubisoft+ Classics library for Ultimate members. The price hike comes as Microsoft seeks to bolster its gaming revenue amid declining Xbox console sales compared to competitors like Sony's PlayStation 5.</p>

          <p>With U.S. home equity at a record high, homeowners are exploring borrowing options like home equity loans and HELOCs, especially as interest rates decline following the Federal Reserve's recent cuts. A HELOC may be more appealing this month due to its lower, variable interest rate, which is expected to fall further. However, a home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed rate, providing security against potential economic volatility. The article advises homeowners to weigh the trade-off between the lower but variable cost of a HELOC and the predictable payments of a slightly more expensive home equity loan.

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in their third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely fueled by record demand for electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush purchases to take advantage of a $7,500 federal EV incentive that expired in September. GM's EV sales more than doubled, while Ford's saw a 30% increase compared to the previous year. This surge in EV adoption helped the overall industry achieve a higher-than-expected sales pace, though some analysts anticipate a potential slowdown in EV sales now that the federal tax credit has ended.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest in three years.

This is about $270 less per month compared to January 2025, when rates were over 7%, and nearly $500 less than in October 2024.

          <p>The BET Hip Hop Awards have been suspended indefinitely, a move attributed to declining ratings but which coincides with broader industry shifts, including the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at parent company Paramount. This article reflects on the award show's 18-year run as a significant, if imperfect, cultural archive for a genre often overlooked by mainstream institutions. The author argues that the cancellation highlights the vulnerability of Black cultural programming to corporate financial decisions and the urgent need for more stable, community-owned institutions to preserve hip-hop's history and narrative.</p>

          <p>In an unusual assembly of military leaders, President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered speeches indicating a desire to reshape the armed forces into a more partisan and culturally conservative institution. Hegseth focused on purging "wokeness" and rolling back diversity and misconduct reporting procedures, while Trump described a "war from within" and suggested using U.S. cities for military training. This article analyzes the speeches as a clear signal to generals that their future missions may involve suppressing domestic dissent and conforming to the administration's political agenda, raising concerns about the military's civilian control.</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" and the temporary suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" have created significant instability in the late-night television landscape, posing challenges for advertisers. President Trump's vocal criticism of these shows and calls for others to be canceled have added a layer of political pressure. Live programming like late-night talk shows remains a valuable and rare opportunity for advertisers to reach engaged audiences. However, as media companies shift focus to streaming and face rising costs and political scrutiny, the future of this traditional advertising staple appears increasingly uncertain.</p>

          <p>Eight months into President Trump's second term, an aggressive campaign to compel so-called "sanctuary" cities and states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement has yielded few concrete results. Despite numerous lawsuits and threats to cut funding, most targeted jurisdictions have not altered their policies, and court rulings have largely blocked the administration's attempts to withhold federal funds. The Justice Department has cited only one city, Louisville, Kentucky, that has abandoned its policies in response to legal pressure. The standoff highlights the ongoing clash between federal immigration authority and local governance rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has stripped funding from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), a key federal watchdog body. The White House claims the inspectors general have become "corrupt" and "partisan," while critics argue the move will cripple government oversight and isolate individual agency watchdogs. CIGIE provides essential training, data analysis, and investigative support to nearly 14,000 federal employees tasked with rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. The decision has drawn bipartisan criticism from senators who warn it will severely compromise the ability to protect taxpayer interests.</p>

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is significantly scaling back its operations as it navigates bankruptcy, ending service to eleven cities primarily in the western and southern U.S. The airline also plans to furlough approximately 1,800 flight attendants, seek pay cuts from pilots, and reduce its overall flight schedule by 25%. These drastic measures are part of a restructuring effort aimed at returning the airline to profitability following a failed merger and a post-pandemic shift in consumer preferences. Analysts warn that Spirit's withdrawal from these routes could lead to higher fares for consumers due to reduced competition.</p>

The article explores how the human brain is not wired to interact with non-conscious entities that speak fluently, leading some users into delusion.

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry has been significantly softened following a new drug pricing agreement with Pfizer. The deal includes a three-year exemption from such tariffs in exchange for Pfizer voluntarily lowering some U.S. drug prices and investing $70 billion in domestic manufacturing. This agreement sets a precedent for other major drugmakers, many of whom are now expected to seek similar pacts with the administration. The development has brought relief to the industry, suggesting a path to avoid broad, punitive tariffs while still allowing the president to claim a victory on drug pricing.</p>

He referenced a 1999 Buffett quote describing a phase where investors are driven by momentum rather than fundamentals, leading to irrational exuberance and bubble-like conditions. Cooperman pointed to the "ridiculously high" valuations of artificial intelligence companies as evidence of this trend. While he believes stocks are risky, he considers them less risky than government bonds at current levels due to the erosive effect of inflation on fixed-income returns. (not investment advice)</p>

As a result, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs and non-essential government services will be halted. The impasse reflects deep partisan divisions over spending and healthcare policy, leading to the first government shutdown since 2018.</p>
