            <p>Sanya, a resort city in Hainan, China, is experiencing a significant increase in Russian tourists, with Russian becoming more commonly spoken than English. The surge in visitors has helped the local travel sector recover from the pandemic, with Russian tourist visits increasing elevenfold in 2024. This upswing is attributed to a general recovery in Russian outbound tourism and China's relaxed visa policies, including visa-free stays of up to 30 days for citizens of 59 countries in Hainan province.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely watching the U.S. bond market after a rare surge in bond yields, signaling a potential loss of confidence in the U.S. economy due to uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs. This volatility can affect ordinary Americans through higher borrowing rates for mortgages, credit cards, and car loans, potentially impacting businesses and the housing market. The bond market's reaction to tariffs prompted President Trump to introduce a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries, highlighting the market's influence on policy.

Trump's policies build on Bukele's crackdown against criminal gangs, leveraging anti-establishment anger to justify an authoritarian slide.

            <p>Experts suggest that Donald Trump's escalating trade war could give corporations cover to raise prices, leading to profiteering. While tariffs are expected to increase prices for American consumers, the expectation of inflation could become self-fulfilling. The US Federal Trade Commission is monitoring companies to ensure they compete fairly on price, but analysts suggest that companies may choose to increase profit margins or market share. Consumer expectations about inflation are deeply split along political lines, making it difficult to predict the true impact. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's museums are being tasked with promoting ethnic unity and countering 'wrong historical views,' according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums should avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities and instead tell the 'China story' using archaeological findings. The goal is to cultivate a sense of community within the country and emphasize that China is diverse but unified. This initiative includes refuting attempts to create opposition between the Central Plains and border areas, or between Han and non-Han groups.</p>
