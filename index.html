          <p>Global markets are showing tentative optimism as European leaders prepare to meet with U.S. President Trump to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. However, experts are tempering expectations, suggesting that any peace agreement will be a long and complex process, contrary to market hopes for a swift resolution. The article notes that Russian President Putin may be using the talks to prolong the conflict, a sentiment echoed by Ukrainian officials who see significant obstacles to a comprehensive deal. This dynamic suggests continued volatility, with European defense stocks rising in anticipation of increased spending regardless of the talks' outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners outfielder Victor Robles was ejected from a minor league game after a dangerous outburst where he threw his bat toward the pitcher. The incident occurred during a rehab assignment with the Tacoma Rainiers when Las Vegas Aviators' pitcher Joey Estes threw a high and inside pitch. After making contact, Robles walked around the catcher and hurled his bat at Estes, leading to his immediate removal from the game and being restrained from charging the mound. His frustration continued as he was seen throwing a water cooler from the dugout onto the field before leaving.</p>

          <p>Chinese sportswear company Xtep International reported a record interim net profit of 913.6 million yuan, a 6.4% increase from the previous year. This growth was largely fueled by a marathon boom across China, which significantly boosted sales of its professional running shoe brands, Saucony and Merrell. The professional segment saw a remarkable 32.5% jump in sales, with operating profit more than tripling, validating the company's strategy to fully control the brands' distribution in China. The company's CEO, Ding Shuipo, highlighted the success of their "professional-to-mass" marketing strategy at major marathon events, which has driven brand visibility and sales.</p>

          <p>At least seven people were killed in a shooting at a pool hall in Santo Domingo, Ecuador, marking the latest instance of extreme violence in the nation's struggle against organized crime. This attack follows several similar massacres, including one at another billiards hall and a cockfighting ring, highlighting the escalating brutality of drug trafficking organizations. Despite government crackdowns and states of emergency, the homicide rate has surged, with transnational cartels exploiting the country's ports for drug shipments to the U.S. and Europe. The incident underscores the severe security crisis President Daniel Noboa's administration is facing as gang violence continues unabated.</p>

Ahead of the meeting, Trump publicly pressured Zelenskyy, stating the war could end "almost immediately" if Kyiv accepts territorial concessions, including ruling out the return of Crimea and membership in NATO. The summit follows Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin, where the Russian leader reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the Donbas region for a peace deal. European leaders are attending to support Zelenskyy and defend continental security interests amid concerns over the pressure campaign on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been banned from all football stadiums in the United Kingdom after being arrested for racially abusing Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. The incident occurred during a Premier League match at Anfield, causing the game to be briefly paused after Semenyo reported the abuse to the referee. Merseyside Police confirmed the man was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offense and has been released on conditional bail, which includes the stadium ban. Semenyo later posted on social media, thanking the football community for their unified support in response to the incident.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added several new words popularized by social media, including the viral terms "skibidi" and "tradwife." "Skibidi" originated from a YouTube animated series and is defined as a versatile slang word that can mean "cool" or "bad," or be used nonsensically as a joke. "Tradwife" is a portmanteau for "traditional wife," referring to a married woman who embraces traditional gender roles and often documents it online. Other new entries reflect modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device to feign computer activity, highlighting how internet culture is continuously shaping the English language.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system is a misguided and massively expensive project based on flawed strategic assumptions. The author contends that replicating Israel's successful short-range Iron Dome for the much larger U.S. against long-range threats from Russia and China is impractical and ignores evolving threats like hypersonic missiles and drone swarms. With cost estimates ranging from $175 billion to over $500 billion, the article asserts that the system would be an unconscionable expense that offers a false sense of security. It concludes that the investment would be better spent on other defense and domestic priorities, much like past administrations decided against similar 'Star Wars' concepts.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously known as the last country without a national soccer team, has officially made its international debut in a match held in Springdale, Arkansas. The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese population, which provided enthusiastic support despite a 4-0 loss to the U.S. Virgin Islands. The event was a significant moment of pride and representation for the community, many of whom were displaced by U.S. nuclear testing or emigrated for economic reasons. Despite the loss, the team and fans were jubilant, celebrating the historic milestone and the establishment of a new national identity in the global sports community.</p>

          <p>A fisherman on the Mississippi River in Minnesota has likely solved a nearly 60-year-old cold case after discovering a submerged vehicle with his sonar device. The car, a 1960s-era Buick, was recovered by the Stearns County Sheriff's Office and found to contain human remains. Investigators identified the vehicle as belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing in 1967 and was last seen driving his Buick Electra. While the remains await formal identification, authorities believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family, bringing potential closure to a disappearance that has puzzled the community for decades.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is scheduled to be questioned by a congressional committee regarding his personal involvement in the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death. In the hours after Epstein's death, Barr took the unusual step of personally overseeing the inquiry, including reviewing surveillance footage from the detention center. However, a recent CBS News analysis of the publicly released video identified inconsistencies with Barr's public statements, such as his claim that no one entered Epstein's cell block area. The deposition comes amid renewed scrutiny and conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death, and lawmakers are expected to press Barr on these discrepancies and his role.</p>

The author argues that China's government, dominated by engineers, has achieved massive infrastructure and manufacturing feats, giving it significant economic leverage, as seen with its control over rare-earth magnets. In contrast, the U.S., governed by lawyers, often gets bogged down in proceduralism, hindering its ability to build and innovate on a grand scale. The piece suggests that while America's legal framework protects pluralism, it must rediscover an engineering culture to compete globally and address domestic needs.</p>

While acknowledging the flaws in polling, the article asserts that data remains the most reliable tool for understanding public opinion and testing political strategies, imposing constraints on motivated reasoning.

However, their efforts are further hampered by city rules that limit their activities to specific times and locations, creating a disparity in coastal access for underserved communities.

Many property owners are instead opting for mid-term rentals—stays longer than 30 days—which offer a more stable income stream with less regulatory risk.

          <p>Data reveals a significant increase in the exposure of California dogs to anaplasmosis, a tick-borne bacterial disease that can also infect humans. The percentage of dogs testing positive for the bacterium nearly tripled between 2021 and 2024, serving as a "canary in the coal mine" for public health officials. The disease, spread by the same tick as Lyme disease, can cause fever and lethargy in dogs, but many show no symptoms. Experts attribute the rise to climate change, which allows ticks to expand their territory and lengthen their active season, increasing the risk for both pets and their owners across the state.</p>

          <p>A series of recent fatal air crashes across Africa has intensified scrutiny on the continent's aviation safety standards. Industry experts suggest that the primary causes are not mechanical failures but rather human error, systemic negligence, and a weak safety culture. Issues such as pilots ignoring automated fault warnings, failing to adhere to maintenance schedules, and underestimating increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are cited as major contributing factors. The analysis also points to deeper regulatory failings, including weak government oversight and economic pressures that compromise safety. Experts stress that until these systemic issues are addressed, the risk of air disasters in the region will remain alarmingly high.</p>

          <p>While reporting on the destruction of olive trees near Turmus Aya in the occupied West Bank, BBC journalists witnessed a dozen masked Israeli settlers launch a sudden, unprovoked attack on a Palestinian farm. The settlers, armed with large sticks, charged down from a nearby illegal outpost, escalating into a wider confrontation as local Palestinians gathered to defend the property. The incident, which resulted in torched vehicles, homes, and injuries, is described as part of a familiar pattern of intimidation used by extremist settlers to force Palestinians off their land. The Israeli army intervened, blocking access roads, while Palestinian residents expressed a lack of faith in security forces to protect them.</p>

          <p>The White House and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are increasingly using ironic, aggressive, and often inflammatory memes on social media to promote the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. These posts, which range from retro-style recruitment posters to AI-generated animations of arrests, are popular with the president's supporters but draw sharp criticism for their tone and content. Experts argue the strategy is designed to "own the libs" and provoke outrage, while critics contend the imagery promotes a nationalist, white-centered view of America and, in some cases, appears to reference extremist material. Several artists and musicians have publicly condemned the unauthorized use of their work in these government-produced memes.</p>

          <p>Germany's federal government paid out €20.2 billion in social welfare benefits in 2024, a nearly 15% increase compared to the previous year, according to new data from the Federal Statistical Office. The rise in spending, which covers benefits for those unable to work, comes as the government grapples with a significant budget deficit, estimated at €30 billion for 2027. In response, Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has stated he cannot rule out tax increases, particularly for those with very high wealth and incomes. The governing coalition is currently drafting proposals to reform the social security system to manage the rising costs.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm, threatening the U.S. East Coast with life-threatening surf and rip currents as it moves through the Atlantic. Although not expected to make landfall on the mainland, its outer bands are already affecting the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands with heavy rain. The storm, the first major hurricane of the 2025 season, caused power outages for over 150,000 people in Puerto Rico due to high winds. Authorities in North Carolina's Outer Banks have issued a mandatory evacuation for Hatteras Island, warning that the storm could make the main highway impassable.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk surged nearly 5% following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's accelerated approval of its weight-loss drug, Wegovy, for treating a serious liver disease. The drug is now authorized for adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) who have moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. This approval marks a significant expansion for Wegovy beyond its primary use for obesity and diabetes, making it the first GLP-1 class drug approved for MASH. The decision was based on a trial where Wegovy showed a statistically significant improvement in liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contentious battle over congressional redistricting is unfolding in Texas and California, prompted by President Trump's call for Republicans to create more favorable maps. In Texas, the GOP-led legislature is advancing a plan to draw five new districts that would benefit Republican candidates, a move that led to a temporary walkout by Democratic lawmakers. In response, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing for a new map that could give Democrats an advantage in five districts, attempting to bypass the state's independent redistricting commission. This escalation highlights the political practice of gerrymandering, where district lines are manipulated to secure partisan advantages in elections.</p>

          <p>The investment startup Yieldstreet, which marketed itself as a way for retail investors to "invest like the 1%," is facing severe criticism after numerous real estate projects resulted in massive losses for its customers. An investigation reveals that over $370 million invested in 30 projects has led to at least $78 million in defaults, with many investors expecting total losses on their funds. The article details how rising interest rates and risky underwriting impacted projects across the U.S., leaving customers who were promised access to exclusive, high-return assets with little recourse. Customers have filed complaints with the SEC, alleging the company downplayed risks. (not investment advice)</p>

While the immediate financial impact may be limited, analysts warn it could set a precedent for other international entities.

After losing his own seat in the last general election, Poilievre must win this contest by a significant margin to solidify his leadership ahead of a mandatory party review in January. The race is unusual, featuring a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform. Despite the crowded field, Poilievre is widely expected to win the Conservative stronghold, which will return him to the House of Commons and allow him to directly challenge Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>

Despite a legal challenge from D.C.'s attorney general that blocked a federal takeover of the local police, Republican governors are sending additional troops, some of whom may be armed.
