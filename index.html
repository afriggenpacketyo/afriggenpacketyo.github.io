          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant decline in insurance-underwriting profit, which plunged 48.6% to $1.34 billion due to Southern California wildfires causing $1.1 billion in losses. The conglomerate also suffered a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange as the dollar weakened. Warren Buffett cautioned that tariffs could further negatively impact the company's profits. The earnings per share were $4.47, below analysts' estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil rights groups, led by the African American Policy Forum (AAPF), launched a week-long initiative to protest Donald Trump's attacks on Black history and DEI efforts, including executive orders targeting the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). The Freedom to Learn campaign aims to "flood the zone with Black history" in response to what they see as an attempt to erase difficult chapters of American history. The campaign included educational sessions, meetups, and a "Black history challenge" to promote awareness and preservation of Black history. Trump's administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from schools with DEI programs and has ordered an overhaul of the Smithsonian Institution to remove "divisive or anti-American ideology".</p>

          <p>Following the death by suicide of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, conspiracy theorists, including Donald Trump Jr., have begun circulating theories suggesting foul play. These theories reference the deaths of other Epstein survivors from overdoses in recent years, fueling speculation of a cover-up. The article argues that these deaths are tragic outcomes of the long-term trauma associated with childhood sexual abuse, which increases the risk of substance abuse and suicide. It criticizes those promoting conspiracy theories, urging them to address the systemic issues that protect powerful abusers and silence victims of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber is facing a unique challenge as he defends the institution against the Trump administration's attempts to cut federal funding and strip its tax-exempt status, while simultaneously addressing concerns about campus culture. Garber agrees with some of the Trump administration's criticisms, acknowledging that Harvard has sometimes shut out dissenting voices and allowed antisemitism to go unchecked. He has taken steps to reform the university's policies on student discipline, protests, and diversity, which has sparked pushback from some students who feel he is prioritizing optics over values. Garber is determined to protect Harvard's academic independence and ensure that American research universities can continue to contribute to the nation's progress.</p>

Doctors at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center found that the rare pericardiac cyst was growing in the muscle of his heart and compressing his right ventricular outflow tract. Donaldson underwent open-heart surgery to remove the mass and reconstruct his RVOT, and is now recovering and resuming his normal activities.

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. While the administration aims to promote domestic manufacturing, automakers and suppliers say relocating assembly lines will take years. The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and create financial stress for suppliers. Despite exemptions for parts from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs will impact carmakers like General Motors and Volvo Cars, as well as those in the Canadian auto parts sector.</p>
