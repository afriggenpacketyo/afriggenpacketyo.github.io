          <h2>UK Health Secretary Vows to Minimize Disruption from Resident Doctors' Strike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:15:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As resident doctors in England begin a five-day strike over a long-running pay dispute, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to minimize service disruption. Unlike previous walkouts that prioritized emergency care, NHS England has instructed hospitals to maintain non-urgent services as well, with senior doctors providing cover. The British Medical Association warns this approach could stretch staff too thin and risk safety, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized the union for rushing into damaging industrial action. The dispute centers on pay restoration, with the BMA arguing that salaries have fallen by a fifth since 2008 when accounting for inflation.</p>

          <h2>Hot Weather in June Provides Boost to UK Retail Sales</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's retail sales volumes saw a 0.9% increase in June, largely driven by hot weather, according to the Office for National Statistics. Supermarkets reported higher sales of drinks, and fuel sales rose as more people traveled during the sunny period. However, this follows a revised 2.8% drop in May, indicating volatility in consumer spending. The overall trend suggests a loss of momentum, with sales growing by only 0.2% in the second quarter, aligning with forecasts for lackluster economic growth and weaker consumer confidence.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement projected to boost their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually in the long term. The deal, finalized after three years of negotiations, will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and Scotch whisky. Under the agreement, 92% of UK exports to India will see reduced or eliminated tariffs, while 99% of Indian goods shipped to Britain will become tariff-exempt. Leaders from both nations hailed the pact as a "historic" deal that will enhance economic prosperity and lower consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georges Abdallah, a 74-year-old Lebanese militant, has been released from a French prison after serving 41 years, making him one of the longest-serving prisoners for acts related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Convicted in 1987 for complicity in the murders of a U.S. and an Israeli diplomat, his case remained a cause célèbre for far-left activists. Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, allegedly due to pressure from the U.S. and Israel. A French appeals court ultimately ruled his detention "disproportionate," ordering his release and immediate expulsion to Lebanon.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its 2025 financial forecast after reporting a significant 29% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell to 3.83 billion euros. The company attributed the decline to the impact of U.S. import tariffs, restructuring costs, and increased sales of lower-margin electric vehicles. Consequently, Volkswagen has lowered its expected operating return on sales for the year and now anticipates that full-year sales will be in line with the previous year, a downgrade from its earlier projection of up to 5% growth.

The turmoil comes as NASA contends with significant funding declines, the recent departure of high-level directors, and the absence of a permanent administrator.

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting to address the escalating border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia. The meeting follows a second day of intense fighting near disputed ancient temples, with both countries accusing the other of initiating the violence. The clashes have involved heavy weapons, including artillery and rockets, resulting in at least 14 deaths on the Thai side and the evacuation of over 100,000 civilians. Cambodia has also reported civilian casualties and evacuations as the long-running territorial dispute has erupted into significant armed conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating college athletics, directing federal agencies to enforce new provisions on scholarships and athlete compensation. The order seeks to protect non-revenue and women's sports by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels and aims to rein in "pay-for-play" name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. It frames these measures as a necessary national solution to prevent the deterioration of intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA and major college sports conferences have applauded the move, hoping it will lead to federal legislation.</p>

          <p>Italian journalist Roberto Saviano, author of "Gomorrah," has reflected on a recent court victory in which a powerful Camorra mafia boss was convicted for making threats against him. The verdict, which came 17 years after the initial threat was made during a trial, affirmed that the written word is what criminal organizations fear most. Saviano describes the immense personal cost of his work, including living under constant police protection, which has destroyed his personal life and freedom. He concludes that while justice has been served in this case, his life remains a "suspended sentence."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing a major regulatory hurdle for the deal. The approval transfers broadcast licenses for 28 CBS television stations to the new entity, which will be led by Skydance founder David Ellison. The decision, which followed a controversial $16 million legal settlement between Paramount and President Donald Trump, was met with criticism from Democratic officials who cited a conflict of interest. As part of the approval, Skydance has committed to installing an ombudsman to review complaints of media bias.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit argues that these provisions intentionally obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law and compromise public safety. The legal action comes shortly after an off-duty CBP officer was shot, allegedly by undocumented immigrants, and follows promises from officials to "flood the zone" with immigration agents in sanctuary cities. A spokesperson for the mayor stated that the city's laws go too far and that the council has refused to re-examine them.</p>

          <p>During a visit to the Federal Reserve's headquarters, President Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell openly disagreed about the cost of an extensive renovation project. The president insisted the cost had reached $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, stating it improperly included a building completed five years ago. The public exchange highlights ongoing tensions, with Trump recently suggesting the project's cost overruns could be grounds for firing Powell, though he later said it was unnecessary. The president reiterated his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A majority of MPs on the UK's influential Foreign Affairs Select Committee have called for the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state. In a new report, Labour and Liberal Democrat members argued that statehood is an "inalienable right" that should not be conditional on a final peace settlement. However, the committee's Conservative members dissented, echoing the government's position that recognition should be part of a long-term, two-state solution. The call comes as pressure mounts on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to follow France's recent move to recognize Palestine amid the worsening crisis in Gaza.</p>
