          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the coasts of Chile and Argentina, prompting a tsunami warning for areas within 185 miles of the epicenter. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for coastal regions, including the Strait of Magellan and nearby Antarctic areas. President Boric assured that all resources were available to respond to the situation, urging residents to heed the authorities. In Ushuaia, Argentina, water activities were suspended, while in Punta Arenas, Chile, residents evacuated calmly to shelters, and no immediate reports of damage or casualties were reported.</p>

President Trump eliminated the exemption due to concerns about fentanyl entering the U.S. through this channel, and retailers are already adding tariff surcharges to orders.

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs, potentially increasing prices for online purchases. The de minimis rule, which exempted products up to $800 from tariffs, had led to a surge of individually addressed packages from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The move aims to help U.S. manufacturers compete with low-cost Chinese products and address concerns about fentanyl entering the country through the loophole. The changes, effective for shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong, are expected to cause confusion for consumers and small retailers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to cut public funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), citing leftwing bias. The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to cease federal funding for the two outlets, arguing that government funding of news media is outdated and undermines journalistic independence. Public media are expected to fight the order, with PBS exploring all options. The order references concerns about voter registrations of NPR employees and coverage of trans issues, diversity, Covid-19's origins, and Hunter Biden's laptop.</p>
