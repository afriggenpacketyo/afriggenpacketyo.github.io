          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with legislation to enact President Trump's domestic agenda, including tax cuts and changes to Medicaid and food assistance programs. The "big beautiful bill" faces opposition from Democrats and dissent within Republican ranks, particularly regarding the state and local tax deduction cap and proposed cuts to Medicaid. Senators Rand Paul, Ron Johnson, Susan Collins, and Josh Hawley have voiced concerns about the bill's fiscal responsibility and Medicaid provisions. Despite the challenges, House Republican leaders aim to pass the legislation before the Memorial Day recess, utilizing budget reconciliation to shield it from a filibuster. </p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the sinking of the Bayesian superyacht off Sicily, which resulted in seven deaths, indicates that the yacht was likely capsized by a strong gust of wind. The report highlights the yacht's unusually tall single mast as a contributing factor to its instability in high winds. Additionally, a deckhand's delay in alerting the captain while posting a video of the approaching storm on social media exacerbated the situation. The investigation also found that the yacht's stability book lacked critical data about its vulnerability to capsizing. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a $20 million cut to the state's funding for local newsrooms, reducing a planned $30 million investment to $10 million. The cut is attributed to a $12 billion budget shortfall and affects a deal with Google to support local journalism through a News Transformation Fund. The original plan, modeled after a Canadian bill, aimed to provide financial aid to struggling newspapers based on their number of journalists. This reduction raises concerns about the future of local journalism in California, especially as newsrooms continue to face financial challenges. </p>

          <p>A luxury hotel project planned by the Trump family in Serbia is facing complications after a Serbian official admitted to forging a key document that allowed the demolition of a protected site.

The official, Goran Vasic, fabricated an expert opinion to justify stripping the site of its cultural heritage status, leading to charges of abuse of office and forgery.

The judge refuted the government's claims of Suri's ties to Hamas through his wife and father-in-law, stating there was no evidence of his support for the organization.

          <p>The Trump administration's policies towards South Africa have been influenced by a convergence of factors, including meetings with Afrikaner activists and a focus on eradicating diversity and inclusion programs. President Trump's interest in granting asylum to white South African farmers, fueled by conversations with figures like golfer Gary Player and false narratives from white Afrikaner activists, has shaped U.S. foreign policy. This has led to the suspension of refugee programs for other groups and the welcoming of white South Africans as refugees. The administration's approach also includes halting foreign aid to South Africa and expelling the country's ambassador, reflecting a focus on white victimhood and a break over Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers have successfully revived long-dormant thrusters on Voyager 1, the spacecraft farthest from Earth, averting a potential communications blackout. The fix to the vehicleâ€™s original roll thrusters, which had been out of action since 2004, was crucial before upgrades to an Earth-based antenna temporarily cut off communication with the probe. The revival of these thrusters ensures Voyager 1 can maintain its orientation and continue sending back data from interstellar space. This article highlights the ingenuity and risk-taking involved in fixing broken equipment on a spacecraft billions of miles away. </p>

          <p>Santa Monica's City Council has approved a proposal to turn the Third Street Promenade into an "entertainment zone" by allowing visitors to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages outdoors. The initiative aims to revitalize the commercial district, which has experienced declining foot traffic since 2019. The "Entertainment Zone" will operate on Fridays through Sundays, requiring participants to be 21 or older and wear wristbands. While supporters believe the proposal will boost local businesses, some residents have raised concerns about potential issues such as crime and homelessness. </p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking a positive shift in the fight against the opioid crisis. However, this progress is threatened by proposed funding cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing drug addiction, by the Trump administration. While the CDC praised President Trump's efforts, experts warn that these cuts could undermine the momentum gained in reducing drug-related fatalities. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, underscoring the need for continued investment in prevention, treatment, and support services. </p>

Trump defended Qatar's offer of a Boeing 747-8 as Air Force One, citing the underwhelming nature of the current presidential aircraft.

          <p>Missouri Republicans are attempting to reinstate a near-total abortion ban through a ballot measure, seeking to overturn a recent voter-approved amendment that established abortion rights. The measure, set to appear on the ballot in November 2026, would ban abortion except in medical emergencies or in cases of reported rape or incest. This move contrasts with the trend of voters siding with abortion rights on ballot measures since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortion rights groups have condemned the legislature's action as a direct assault on voters and are preparing to fight the measure. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits starting in 2026. The decision is driven by a higher-than-expected program cost and economic uncertainty related to federal tariff policies. While existing enrollees will not be affected, new applications will be frozen, and adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will be required to pay a monthly premium starting in 2027. Newsom cited the need for financial contributions from beneficiaries and emphasized California's continued commitment to supporting immigrants. </p>
