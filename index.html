        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has imposed a surprise 39% tariff rate on Swiss goods, a decision that has stunned the nation and its business leaders. This rate is significantly higher than the 10-15% tariffs negotiated by other key U.S. partners like the EU and Japan, posing a major threat to the Swiss export-driven economy. While the pharmaceutical sector may be exempt, the move has already caused market jitters, with manufacturing associations warning of job losses. Swiss officials are still hoping to negotiate a more favorable deal before the tariffs take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling short of the 100,000 forecast and signaling a potential slowdown in the labor market. Compounding the weak report, job numbers for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating prior months were significantly less robust than initially reported. The unemployment rate also increased slightly to 4.2%, while wage growth remained modest. These figures could influence the Federal Reserve to consider lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Sharpe, who has since left his role at ESPN, expressed gratitude for his time at the network.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who is jailed on charges of rebellion related to his brief imposition of martial law, has escalated his refusal to cooperate with investigators. On Friday, when prosecutors arrived to question him about separate allegations, Yoon reportedly took off his prison uniform and lay on the floor to resist being moved. This is his latest act of defiance, as his legal team claims he is too ill to attend trial or questioning. The special counsel investigating him has vowed to execute the court-issued warrant to compel his cooperation in the future.</p>

Reports suggest the bid was around £110 million plus add-ons, which is below Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million for the Sweden international. Isak has reportedly expressed a desire to leave the club and was not included in their pre-season tour, despite the team qualifying for the Champions League.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the "Happy Gilmore" film series, including the newly released sequel, subtly promotes traditional conservative family values. The author contends that the protagonist's motivation in both films is not personal glory but selfless dedication to his family—first saving his grandmother's house and now providing for his daughter's dream. The piece suggests that Adam Sandler, the star and a former registered Republican, uses the comedic character to convey a message that a meaningful life is one of altruism and fulfilling obligations to one's family. The author notes that Sandler even cast his own wife and daughters in the sequel, reinforcing this theme.</p>

          <p>Many international aid organizations are remaining silent about the Trump administration's significant funding cuts, a strategy some experts are calling "anticipatory silence." Fearing further targeting or hoping to negotiate privately for restored funds, these groups avoid public criticism of policies that have halted programs for HIV prevention, clean water, and child nutrition. This quiet approach is a subject of intense internal debate within the nonprofit sector. While some argue it is a necessary survival tactic, others believe that failing to speak out allows the administration to control the narrative and could embolden further cuts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its decision to incinerate nearly $10 million worth of birth control, including IUDs and contraceptive pills, that had been purchased by USAID for distribution in low-income countries. This action is a direct result of funding cuts by the administration's "department of government efficiency," led by Elon Musk. Non-profits that offered to pay for shipping and distribution were refused due to rules prohibiting providing goods to groups that offer abortion-related services. Critics argue this move is part of a broader attack on reproductive health that harms women's health, autonomy, and economic opportunities globally.</p>

          <p>Chevron reported a significant 44% decline in second-quarter net income, which fell to $2.49 billion, largely due to lower crude oil prices and a one-time charge related to its acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop in profit, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.77 beat Wall Street estimates. The oil major achieved record global production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with U.S. output seeing a notable 8% jump. The recently finalized Hess acquisition is expected to boost earnings starting in the fourth quarter and contribute to future cost reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil's second-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations, as record production levels helped mitigate the impact of lower oil prices. The company's net income was $7.1 billion, a 23% decrease from the previous year, but its earnings per share of $1.64 surpassed the forecasted $1.54. Production reached 4.6 million barrels per day, the highest for a second quarter in over 25 years, driven by strong output in the Permian Basin and Guyana. Exxon also continued its aggressive shareholder return program, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Masters, the chief executive of the Premier League, has confirmed that England's top football division will not be reduced from 20 to 18 clubs. The statement comes amid growing tensions with FIFA over an increasingly congested global match calendar, which includes an expanded Club World Cup and a 48-team World Cup. Masters criticized FIFA for a lack of proper consultation with domestic leagues, arguing that the calendar is being redesigned "at the altar of European and global expansion." He asserted that while the league supports growth, it should not come at the expense of domestic football's integrity and structure.</p>

          <p>Low-wage workers across the U.S. are expressing deep concern over the Trump administration's looming cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. The changes, which shift more administrative costs to states and expand work requirements, are expected to cause millions of families to lose some or all of their benefits. For workers like a single mother earning $3 an hour plus tips, the current benefits are already insufficient to cover rising food costs. Experts and advocates warn that these cuts will dismantle a critical safety net, leading to increased hunger and poverty for the nation's most vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A new peer-reviewed study concludes that a mass death of monarch butterflies in Southern California in January 2024 was likely caused by pesticide exposure. Researchers tested deceased butterflies found twitching or in piles near a wintering site and discovered an average of seven different pesticides in each insect, at levels suspected to be lethal. The findings provide rare, direct field evidence supporting the theory that pesticides are a key driver of the dramatic decline in monarch populations. The study points to the combined, or synergistic, effect of multiple chemicals as a significant threat to the iconic species' survival.</p>

Under the new rule, dealers must now report any cash transactions totaling 100,000 yuan (about $13,870) or more to the country's financial crime watchdog. This is China's first such regulation to extend beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector. The move aims to prevent illicit funds from being laundered through the purchase of high-value, easily transportable assets like gold and jewels, which had become an attractive method for criminals.</p>

This marks a shift away from informal "handshake agreements" toward more formalized structures like co-investments, carried interest, and phantom equity. As a result, compensation is rising, with median total pay for CEOs at larger family offices exceeding $1.2 million annually. (not investment advice)</p>

Many Gen Z voters identify as independent and express a general pessimism about politics, making them a volatile and unpredictable bloc. This trend presents a challenge for both parties, as Gen Z's discontent with the party in power may not result in durable loyalty to the opposition.</p>

Items such as refrigerators, vehicles, peanut butter, and canned soups have all seen price increases.
