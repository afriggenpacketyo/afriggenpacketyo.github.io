          <p>An aircraft has crashed and caught fire at London Southend Airport, prompting a large-scale emergency response from police, fire, and ambulance services. Authorities have established a perimeter and advised the public to avoid the area while they manage the ongoing incident. As a precautionary measure, the nearby Rochford Hundred Golf Club and Westcliff Rugby Club were evacuated due to their proximity to the crash site. Local political figures have expressed their thoughts for everyone involved as emergency operations are expected to continue for several hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Boston-based gastroenterologist suggests that eating two kiwis daily can significantly improve digestive health, primarily due to their high fiber content and a unique protein-digesting enzyme called actinidin. The article cites studies indicating that kiwis are more effective than prunes or psyllium fiber for alleviating constipation and abdominal pain. Beyond gut health, research also links kiwi consumption to a reduced risk of certain cancers and heart disease, thanks to their rich concentration of vitamins and antioxidants that protect against cellular damage.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Rand Paul discussed his committee's report on the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, describing the security situation as a "cascade of errors." He claims the former Secret Service director was untruthful to Congress about resource denials and alleges a "cultural cover-up" within the agency to avoid blame. Paul asserts that crucial requests for assets like counter-snipers were denied for months and that no one has been fired for the significant security lapses, posing a continued danger for future political events.</p>

Hassett suggested that if cause is found, such as alleged mismanagement related to a $700 million cost overrun on the Fed's headquarters renovation, the president could remove him. This signals an escalation in the administration's criticism of Powell, potentially laying the groundwork for his removal before his term expires, with Hassett himself reportedly being a top contender for the position.

          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on deporting dangerous criminals, recent government data reveals a different reality regarding immigration enforcement. As of late June, over 71% of individuals detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have no criminal convictions, and the vast majority are not assigned a high threat level. This disconnect between rhetoric and data has intensified as ICE arrests have surged, with non-public information showing that most of those newly processed have no criminal record. Critics argue this approach misrepresents migrants and creates fear, while the administration maintains its focus is on public safety.</p>

Other examples include a shipwreck in Sydney Harbour that now sprouts a mangrove forest and a former Soviet prison in Estonia that has become a submerged beach attraction. These locations offer visitors a unique glimpse into the past, blending history, nature, and an element of eerie beauty.</p>

          <h2>Recycling E-Waste Emerges as Key Strategy in US-China Rare Earths Competition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:55:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. seeks to reduce its dependence on China for rare earth metals, recycling electronic waste is gaining importance as a viable domestic source for these critical materials. Next-generation recyclers are developing innovative methods to extract valuable elements like neodymium and dysprosium, as well as gold, copper, and lithium, from discarded electronics such as laptops and smartphones. This burgeoning industry is seen as a way to create more resilient domestic supply chains, especially as unpredictable trade policies and tariffs disrupt traditional mining and importing of these essential technological components.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article details how Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney and biologist, used her hobby of genetic genealogy to solve high-profile cold cases. She successfully identified Joseph James DeAngelo as the Golden State Killer by building a family tree from DNA left at a crime scene, providing the crucial lead that ended a decades-long manhunt. The story also covers her work in identifying a living Jane Doe who was kidnapped as a child and solving a 25-year-old sexual assault case in Ohio. The piece explores the power of this new forensic tool while also touching on the privacy concerns it raises.</p>

          <h2>Secret Service Deploys New Drones and Mobile Command Posts After Butler Shooting</h2>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has implemented significant security upgrades. The agency has deployed a fleet of military-grade drones to improve aerial reconnaissance, addressing the failure to detect a commercial drone flown by the shooter before the attack. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, a capability that was lacking in Butler. These changes aim to prevent a repeat of the security failures that occurred that day.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's first pre-season friendly became an emotional tribute to forward Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva, who died in a car crash. Before the match against Preston North End, fans and players participated in renditions of club anthems, a minute of silence, and a wreath-laying ceremony. Players who scored, including Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo, paid tribute through Jota's signature celebrations. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt, and the match served as a moment for the team and its supporters to collectively grieve and honor the beloved player.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to be prepared for a trade war and to firmly defend its interests following President Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports. Macron urged the European Commission to accelerate the preparation of credible countermeasures if a deal is not reached by the August 1 deadline. His call for readiness contrasts with more cautious responses from other European leaders in Germany and Italy, who have urged pragmatic negotiations to avoid escalating the transatlantic trade conflict and find a fair agreement.</p>

          <p>An investigation has been launched in France after a 20-year-old inmate escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside his cellmate's luggage. The prisoner, who was serving multiple sentences and was also under investigation for organized crime, took advantage of his cellmate's scheduled release on Friday. The prison service acknowledged the escape was the result of "a series of serious malfunctions" and an "accumulation of errors." The incident has drawn further attention to the prison, which was recently criticized by the Lyon Bar Association for severe overcrowding.</p>

          <p>Emergency crews in central Texas have suspended their search for victims of the catastrophic July 4th weekend flooding due to new warnings of more severe weather. The Ingram Fire Department ordered all search teams to evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor, as heavy rain raised the threat of another dangerous flash flood. The destructive floodwaters, which rose 26 feet in 45 minutes, washed away homes and vehicles, devastating the Hill Country region and killing at least 27 people at Camp Mystic. The search is expected to resume once conditions are deemed safe.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Make Electric Cars Cheaper to Purchase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:20:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has pledged that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles more affordable for consumers, with a formal announcement expected later this week. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct subsidies, she highlighted a new funding package for charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways. The move aims to boost EV sales, which are currently lagging behind government targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, largely due to the high upfront cost compared to traditional vehicles.</p>
