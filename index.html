          <p>East Los Angeles hosted its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade, imbued with a spirit of defiance against the Trump administration's intensified immigration raids. Despite heightened fears following a Supreme Court ruling that expanded federal agent patrols, many attendees felt compelled to participate and assert their rights. Mayor Karen Bass publicly expressed strong solidarity with her Latino constituents, unequivocally condemning the ongoing raids as abhorrent and divisive. While the event saw slightly lower attendance than previous years, it powerfully emanated a collective sense of Latino joy, cultural pride, and determined resistance against perceived injustices, highlighting community resilience.</p>

          <p>Prominent Chinese scholar Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to independently develop its own artificial intelligence knowledge system, moving beyond its historical reliance on Western social science theories. He articulates significant concerns about "intellectual colonialism" in the rapidly evolving AI era, arguing that Western academic frameworks often prove inadequate for explaining the unique complexities of non-Western civilizations like Confucian, Islamic, or Indian societies. This article suggests that by fully embracing its distinct secular civilization, China can establish a more authentic and influential role in the international order, fostering a unique and self-reliant approach to AI innovation and global leadership.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Utah have arrested two men following the discovery of an incendiary device found under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City. The suspicious device, located near an occupied building, was determined by investigators to have been lit but ultimately failed to function as designed. Subsequent investigations by police and FBI agents led to a search warrant at a Magna residence, where a cache of explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction were uncovered. The two suspects, aged 58 and 31, could face serious charges related to weapons possession and threats of terrorism, although a clear motive has not yet been publicly disclosed.</p>

          <p>The Hingham Police Department is urgently warning the public about a new scam after an 89-year-old woman was defrauded of $19,000 last week. The victim received a convincing email appearing to be from her bank, which led her to believe her account was compromised. Scammers then instructed her to withdraw cash from multiple branches and later sent someone to her home to collect it, promising a secure deposit. Authorities are actively investigating this incident and strongly urge residents to verify suspicious communications directly with their banks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed UK ambassador to the United States. This criticism stems from Mandelson's past supportive communications with Epstein, which recently led to his sacking. Business Secretary Peter Kyle conceded that the appointment would have been "highly unlikely" if the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with Epstein had been known to the government at the time. Giuffre's family emphasized the critical need for greater accountability for public figures who maintained connections with such individuals, particularly after Giuffre's tragic death.</p>

          <p>A growing number of car owners are "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle's worth, with 26.6% of trade-ins having negative equity in Q2 2025. This trend, the highest in four years, means drivers must cover the deficit when buying a new car, often by rolling it into the new loan. Factors like longer loan terms (e.g., 84 months) and smaller down payments exacerbate the issue, leading to an average negative equity of $6,754. The article advises consumers to research, get pre-approved for loans, and consider gap insurance to mitigate risks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Venezuela has accused the United States of "illegally and hostilely" detaining one of its fishing boats for eight hours in its exclusive economic zone. Caracas claims the USS Jason Dunham, a US destroyer, deployed 18 armed agents to board and occupy the vessel carrying nine tuna fishermen. Venezuela's foreign ministry labeled the incident a "direct provocation" aimed at escalating war in the Caribbean to achieve "regime change" in Caracas. This accusation comes amidst soaring tensions between the two nations, with the US increasing pressure on President Maduro and deploying warships to target drug cartels.</p>

          <p>UCLA has fired head football coach DeShaun Foster after an 0-3 start to the season, including back-to-back losses to Mountain West Conference teams. The decision, made swiftly by Athletic Director Martin Jarmond, reflects the university's unwillingness to accept its current status in college football. Foster, who compiled a 5-10 record, is owed approximately $6.43 million in buyout money. The coaching change opens a 30-day transfer window for players and shifts scrutiny onto Jarmond for his initial hiring decision, as UCLA seeks a new coach to lead the program into the Big Ten.</p>
