          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left one critically injured. Firefighters arrived to a chaotic scene with heavy flames and people trapped, ultimately rescuing dozens of individuals. While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, officials noted that sprinklers were present in the building, but smoke damage was widespread. The tragedy has prompted an outpouring of support and a focus on the mental health of the first responders involved in the heroic but traumatic rescue efforts.</p>

          <h2>White House Advisor Suggests Patriotism Is Influencing Consumer Prices Amid Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 12:42:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett proposed a theory that President Trump's leadership has inspired a sense of "patriotism," leading Americans to buy more domestic products. He argued this shift in consumer behavior is a key reason why recent tariffs have not caused significant price inflation, pointing to a report showing a decrease in imported goods prices. Hassett's theory suggests that reduced demand for imports is offsetting the cost of tariffs, which he claims are being absorbed by foreign countries. However, critics and other economic data suggest that stockpiling and methodological issues may be muting the true impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, announced plans to upgrade its Spring Hill, Tennessee, facility to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. This move aims to significantly lower the cost of electric vehicle batteries, as LFP technology does not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. The upgrade is part of GM's broader strategy to diversify its EV portfolio and scale production of more affordable electric vehicles. Commercial production of the new LFP cells is expected to commence by late 2027, complementing GM's other investments in battery development.</p>

          <p>Calvin Duncan, who was wrongly convicted of murder at 19, spent over 28 years in a Louisiana prison where he taught himself law and became a "jailhouse lawyer." He provided legal assistance to hundreds of fellow inmates, helping many overturn their convictions while fighting for his own. With the help of the Innocence Project of New Orleans, Duncan was released in 2011 and later fully exonerated after new evidence revealed misconduct by the detectives in his case. Now a law school graduate, he runs the Light of Justice program, continuing his mission to help incarcerated individuals access the justice system.</p>

These small insects are known to damage book bindings and leaves by feeding on the paste used in them.

          <p>Following sharp criticism from the White House, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to review a costly building expansion project. The project, which involves renovating the Fed's Washington, D.C. headquarters, has faced accusations of "fundamental mismanagement" and "excess spending" from Trump administration officials after its initial $2.5 billion estimate was subject to cost overruns. The Federal Reserve, which is not taxpayer-funded, has defended the project as necessary for safety remediation and modernization. The review by the inspector general will investigate for potential fraud, waste, and abuse in the contentious renovation.</p>

          <p>A new federal spending bill is anticipated to create a surge in the private jet market by reinstating "bonus depreciation," a significant tax benefit for buyers. This provision allows businesses, including individuals who own jets through a company, to write off 100% of the purchase price of a new or used jet in the first year. Aviation brokers report a spike in interest from clients who were waiting for this tax change, which replaces the previous phased-out depreciation schedule. The stimulus comes as the private jet market has been normalizing after a post-pandemic boom, potentially boosting demand and sales.</p>

While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields, long-term CDs can generate substantially greater total returns due to the extended compounding period. For example, a $5,000 investment in a five-year CD at 4.20% could earn over $1,141, far surpassing the $220 earned from a one-year CD at 4.40%. The decision depends on a saver's financial goals, with short-term CDs offering flexibility and long-term CDs providing a way to lock in high rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers for the LA28 Olympic Games have released a preliminary competition schedule, revealing a significant break from tradition. Track and field events will be held during the first week of the Games, while swimming will take place in the second week, a reversal of the usual order. This change accommodates a unique dual-venue opening ceremony at both the Coliseum and SoFi Stadium. The schedule also places new sports like flag football and cricket in prominent slots. The return of the Summer Games to the U.S. is expected to boost viewership, with marquee events scheduled for prime-time windows on the West Coast.</p>

          <p>A small plane crash at London Southend Airport has resulted in the deaths of all four people on board, including a Dutch pilot and co-pilot. The aircraft, a Beech B200 Super King Air operated by Zeusch Aviation, crashed shortly after taking off for the Netherlands on Sunday. Witnesses described seeing the plane bank heavily before it inverted and hit the ground, causing a large explosion. The airport was closed, and an air exclusion zone was established as the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) began its investigation into the cause of the tragic incident. The Dutch company is cooperating fully with the authorities.</p>

          <p>An article highlights the potential financial and psychological harm caused by the largely unregulated life coaching industry, particularly those who incorporate manifestation philosophies. It shares the stories of individuals who spent thousands of dollars on courses from a "manifestation guru," only to end up in debt and feeling more helpless. Experts warn that without oversight or accountability, some coaches can offer dangerous advice, blurring the lines with professional therapy and exploiting vulnerable clients. The piece serves as a cautionary tale about the abstract and often costly promises made by online personalities in the booming wellness space.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has nominated Yuliia Svyrydenko, the current Economy Minister and First Deputy Prime Minister, to become the country's new prime minister. The proposal is part of a broader effort to renew the government's work and boost Ukraine's economic potential during its ongoing war with Russia. Svyrydenko, 39, is credited with successfully negotiating a key mineral deal with the United States and has risen quickly through government ranks. Her appointment, which would make her Ukraine's second female prime minister, must be approved by the country's parliament before she can replace the incumbent, Denys Shmyhal.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sought to alleviate U.S. concerns that his company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China cannot rely on American technology for military purposes because access could be restricted at any time. He also reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to the goal of making American technology a global standard, especially since half of the world's AI developers are in China. These comments come as Huang navigates a delicate balance between Washington's security policies and maintaining access to the critical Chinese market.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that despite decades of promises and the recent generative AI boom, computers and their interfaces are still remarkably unintuitive and "dumb." The author recounts frustrating experiences with Apple's Siri and the new Apple Intelligence, which fail at simple, context-aware tasks like finding files or photos on a personal device. The article traces this failure back to a 1987 Apple concept video, Knowledge Navigator, which envisioned a seamless, conversational computer assistant that remains largely unrealized. It concludes that AI has made little progress in solving the everyday organizational and navigational challenges of our personal digital lives.</p>

          <p>By finishing second in their group, England's Lionesses have landed in what many analysts consider the easier side of the Euro 2025 knockout draw. This placement means they will face Sweden in the quarter-finals, avoiding a match-up with historical rivals Germany. More significantly, it places them in the opposite bracket from the reigning World Cup champions and tournament favorites, Spain, whom they cannot meet until a potential final. While Sweden presents a formidable challenge, England's path to the final would then involve a semi-final against either Norway or Italy, creating a more favorable route on paper.</p>

The proposed legislation would require the use of more advanced and diverse crash test dummies, including one simulating a smaller woman.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing a significant political crisis at the start of the summer recess after his coalition government failed to elect three new judges to the country's Constitutional Court. The vote was pulled from the agenda when it became clear that a candidate nominated by the junior coalition partner, the SPD, lacked sufficient support from within Merz's own conservative bloc. The incident has raised questions about the chancellor's control over his party and the stability of the governing coalition.

          <p>Despite a rush of orders from U.S. companies trying to stock up before a tariff truce expires, China's exports to the United States still fell by 16% in June compared to the previous year. However, this was a smaller decline than the 34.5% drop seen in May, indicating the temporary reprieve had some effect. Overall, China's global trade remained robust in the first half of the year, hitting a record high as businesses successfully diversified to other markets, particularly in Southeast Asia.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to choose the best Certificate of Deposit (CD) term. Some experts suggest that short-term CDs remain a strong option, as banks are keeping their rates competitive in the current environment. Others argue that locking in a high yield with a long-term CD now could maximize earnings before rates fall. For those who are uncertain, building a CD ladder with staggered maturity dates is recommended as a balanced strategy to mitigate interest rate risk while maintaining some liquidity.
