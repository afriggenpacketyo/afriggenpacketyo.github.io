          <h2>Meta Faces Potential $7 Billion Revenue Drop Due to China Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 15:52:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decrease by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's tariffs on China, impacting retailers like Temu and Shien who may reduce their Facebook and Instagram ad spending. MoffettNathanson analysts estimate that China accounts for over 11% of Meta's total sales, with Temu and Shien being significant contributors. A broader market recession combined with the trade dispute could further reduce Meta's advertising revenues by $23 billion and earnings by 25%. Despite these concerns, MoffettNathanson maintains a Buy rating on Meta, though they have decreased their target price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has exceeded $90,000 as investors seek refuge from stock market volatility and a declining dollar, marking a decoupling from risk assets. U.S. ETFs tracking Bitcoin saw significant inflows, surpassing gold's gains in April, while the S&P 500 and U.S. dollar index have both declined. Analysts note Bitcoin's resilience and potential to break above resistance levels, supported by long-term holders and strategic buying amidst declining liquidity. Chart analysts identify $88,000 as a key resistance level, with the next target near $95,900 if cleared successfully. (not investment advice)</p>

Bondi highlighted the conviction of an Arizona man who plotted to bomb Christian churches, arrested during the Biden administration, as a success in combating violence targeting churches.

These "lawsuit influencers" often gain large audiences by providing detailed, line-by-line analysis of court filings, appealing to a desire for transparency and a populist message that anyone can become an expert. While some creators are actual attorneys, others are simply avid readers of legal documents, romanticizing the process of research and study.

          <p>Experts predict mortgage rates will remain relatively stable in 2025, with little expectation of significant drops. Despite potential for two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the impact on mortgage rates may be limited due to factors like housing supply and demand. The article suggests that prospective buyers should focus on affordability and explore strategies such as considering smaller homes, fixer-uppers, or condominiums. The current housing market is characterized by limited supply and high prices, making it unlikely that both interest rates and home prices will drop simultaneously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to end the IRS's Direct File program, despite its success in saving users an average of $160 in tax preparation fees. The program, launched during the Biden administration, has faced opposition from private tax preparation companies. Democratic lawmakers are urging the Treasury Secretary and IRS acting commissioner to maintain the program, citing its ease of use and popularity. The IRS is also undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, with plans to reduce its workforce.</p>

          <p>Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei has reached 500 days in office, implementing radical pro-market reforms that have garnered global attention. His policies, including lifting currency controls, have shown early signs of success, such as decreased poverty and inflation. However, critics caution against relying on the exchange rate to suppress inflation, citing concerns about wages and social cuts. While some see Milei as a reformer liberating Argentina from bureaucracy, others express concerns about the impact of his austerity measures.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case involving LGBTQ-inclusive books in Maryland public schools, with Republican justices appearing convinced the school district violated the Constitution.

Concerns have been raised about the potential for overly broad rulings that could disrupt public school instruction on various topics. The justices explored different approaches, including focusing on younger students or alleged animus against certain religious beliefs.</p>
