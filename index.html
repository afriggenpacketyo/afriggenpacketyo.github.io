          <p>A new bill signed into law by President Trump has established the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) for student loan borrowers, set to be available by July 2026. This income-driven plan calculates payments based on adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum monthly payment. Unlike previous plans, RAP offers forgiveness after 30 years and provides a $50 monthly credit per dependent. After July 2026, new borrowers will have only two choices: RAP or a standard repayment plan, which will significantly alter the landscape for future student debt management.

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic and influential frontman of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death, though the specific cause was not disclosed, following his public battles with Parkinson's disease and injuries from a fall. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's career spanned over five decades, marked by his pioneering work with Black Sabbath, a successful solo career, and later fame as a reality TV star.

          <p>A panel of federal judges in New Jersey has voted to replace Alina Habba, President Trump's choice for the state's top federal prosecutor, at the end of her interim term. Habba, a former personal attorney for Trump with no prior prosecutorial experience, will be succeeded by career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace. This rare move by the judiciary comes after Habba's controversial tenure, which included opening investigations into prominent state Democrats. The decision has been criticized by the Justice Department as politically motivated, highlighting tensions between the administration and the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Senator Mike Lee of Utah briefly caused a stir by posting a fraudulent letter on social media that claimed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was resigning. The fake document, which featured a distorted Fed seal and unusual formatting, was shared with the caption "Powell's out!" before being deleted. Lee later stated he removed the post out of caution because he was unsure of the letter's authenticity. The incident occurred amid ongoing criticism of Powell by President Trump, who has been pressuring the Fed chair to lower interest rates and has previously urged his resignation.</p>

GM disclosed a $1.1 billion hit in the last quarter, while Stellantis reported paying nearly $400 million in tariffs, which also contributed to production pauses. So far, data suggests that manufacturers have been absorbing these costs rather than passing them on to consumers, who are already facing high vehicle prices. This trend is squeezing profit margins and raising concerns about the long-term financial health of the industry if the tariff policies persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to rescind a ban and approve the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China has drawn sharp criticism from China hawks in Washington. The reversal came after a June trade deal where the U.S. eased some export controls in exchange for Chinese rare earth minerals. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the move, stating the U.S. is selling a lower-tier chip to keep Chinese developers reliant on American technology. However, critics are concerned that the move undermines national security and contradicts previous hardline stances on restricting China's access to advanced technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis by the immigrant rights group CHIRLA reveals that recent federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles County have disproportionately targeted overwhelmingly Latino neighborhoods. A heat map based on verified reports shows hotspots of activity in areas like Panorama City and Pico Rivera, where the population is predominantly Latino. CHIRLA's executive director called the raids "blatant racial profiling" and a "surgical attack meant to provoke panic." The data reinforces widespread community fears and legal challenges alleging that ICE's enforcement tactics are unlawfully based on race and ethnicity rather than specific intelligence.</p>
