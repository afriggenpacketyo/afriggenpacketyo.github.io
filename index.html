        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lou Ye's latest movie, "An Unfinished Film," explores the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic by following a film crew quarantined near Wuhan. The semi-documentary style feature has received international acclaim and awards, not for its artistic merit, but for its courageous and honest portrayal of the lockdown experience. The article critiques the film for avoiding the mass casualties that followed the end of "zero COVID," suggesting it reflects a broader societal silence on the pandemic's trauma. It concludes that while the film is an essential acknowledgment of a hidden memory, the full story of the pandemic in China remains unfinished.</p>

Meanwhile, Gaza's health ministry reported 66 Palestinian deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to over 67,000, and noted additional deaths from starvation. The World Health Organization's Director-General also expressed support for the peace plan, highlighting that peace is the best medicine for the region.

          <p>The right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, is poised to win the Czech parliamentary election with over 30% of the vote, according to opinion polls. Babis, who opposes continued military aid to Ukraine, has campaigned on a "Czech first" platform, raising concerns about a potential shift in the country's foreign policy. A victory for ANO could align the Czech Republic with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU policies, particularly regarding support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. The outcome may depend on coalition-building, with the far-right SPD party as a potential partner.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, making her the likely first female prime minister of the country. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her election is seen as an attempt by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses and to appeal to its conservative base. Takaichi will face immediate challenges, including navigating relations with the U.S. and addressing domestic economic issues.</p>

          <p>Rail operator Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for health and safety breaches that led to the death of Bethan Roper in 2018. The 28-year-old suffered a fatal head injury after leaning out of a droplight window on a moving train and striking a tree branch. The Office of Rail and Road prosecuted GWR, stating the company was aware of the risks associated with these windows but had failed to implement safety measures identified in a risk assessment.

          <p>One month before Election Day, gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia are serving as early tests of former President Trump's political influence and his second-term agenda. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are clashing over Trump's impact, while Virginia's race between Winsome Earle-Sears and Abigail Spanberger is also heavily influenced by national issues. Other significant contests include New York City's mayoral election, a California redistricting proposition, and crucial state Supreme Court races in Pennsylvania. These elections are being closely watched as indicators for the upcoming midterm showdowns.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon reveals a significant temperature difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A team of scientists in China and Britain studied samples from the Chang'e-6 mission and found that minerals from the far side likely formed in lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This discovery of thermal asymmetry provides new insights into the moon's formation and evolution. It helps explain the long-observed stark contrasts in topography and volcanic activity between the two sides of Earth's natural satellite.</p>

He expressed concern that leadership is more focused on punishing perceived political enemies than on national security, noting his abrupt removal from important cases, including the prosecution of a suspect in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.</p>

          <p>The composition of the White House press corps has shifted during Donald Trump's second term, with an increasing presence of reporters from openly supportive MAGA-affiliated media outlets. This article analyzes how these individuals often ask laudatory or softball questions, allowing the president and his press secretary to deflect from tougher inquiries by mainstream journalists. The White House now selects the reporter pool for Oval Office sessions, frequently including these friendly voices while excluding others. This change alters the traditional adversarial role of the press, creating a more controlled and favorable media environment for the administration.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that conservative criticism of Bad Bunny's selection as the Super Bowl halftime performer is misguided and based on a misunderstanding of American geography and identity. The author points out that as a Puerto Rican, Bad Bunny is a U.S. citizen, and his use of Spanish should not be seen as unpatriotic, citing a history of non-American performers at the event. The piece suggests that such backlash is a form of fear-mongering and that embracing bilingualism and cultural diversity is a strength, not a weakness.

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, has requested an average rate hike of 35.8% following an estimated $4 billion in losses from January's fire storms. This would be the plan's largest increase in years and comes as it faces hundreds of thousands of new policyholders due to private insurers retreating from the fire-prone market. The request is controversial, as the FAIR Plan is already facing lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its handling of smoke damage claims from recent wildfires.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering minting a new one-dollar coin featuring President Donald Trump to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him after his 2024 near-assassination on the other, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The move is potentially authorized by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, which allows for semiquincentennial designs. However, it may face legal hurdles, as federal law generally prohibits living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, though exceptions have been made in the past.</p>

          <p>Flight operations at Germany's Munich airport have been suspended and subsequently resumed for the second time in 24 hours due to unconfirmed drone sightings in the airspace. The disruption on Friday evening affected approximately 6,500 passengers and caused at least 17 flights to be grounded. This incident is the latest in a series of drone-related disruptions at European airports, prompting discussions among EU leaders about enhancing anti-drone defenses. Officials are investigating the origin of the drones, with some European leaders suggesting a possible connection to Russia amid heightened geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian from Tang dynasty China. The theory is based on stylistic similarities between the statue and Chinese "zhenmushou" mythical beasts, as well as lead isotope analysis matching the bronze to ore sources in China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate the 2.8-tonne statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo before being altered. However, this claim is being disputed by some scholars in China.</p>

          <p>This article details the severe impact of federal spending cuts on low-income residents in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a post-industrial area that strongly supports Donald Trump. Individuals reliant on programs like Medicaid and SNAP (food assistance) are facing the loss of essential benefits, with some fearing for their lives without access to healthcare and medication. Despite their dependence on this aid, some residents continue to support the president, echoing his rhetoric about overhauling a welfare system they believe is abused by others. The story highlights a deep disconnect between the political support for these policies and the dire real-world consequences for the community.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with new mandates in the UK and EU requiring a percentage of jet fuel to be sustainable (SAF), a key component of its plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. While some airlines are investing in SAF, others, like Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, are deeply skeptical, questioning the feasibility and availability of supplies to meet increasing targets. The primary challenge is scaling up production, especially of second-generation SAF made from waste, which requires significant investment and government support. The article highlights the uncertain and "lumpy transition" towards greener flying, with debates over cost, supply, and technological viability.</p>

Jornet, considered one of the greatest mountain athletes ever, chose routes based on aesthetics and challenge rather than pure efficiency, such as traversing long, technical ridgelines. The project was not just a physical feat but also an artistic exploration of the American wilderness and a way to connect with its landscapes.</p>

This support was evident in recent municipal elections where the AfD dominated integration councils in cities with large Russia German populations. Researchers attribute this trend to the community's conservative views on citizenship and the AfD's Russia-friendly political stance and targeted outreach efforts.</p>

The exchange of these traditional pastries is often seen as a barometer for consumer confidence and spending on non-essential goods. One corporate manager noted their company's budget for employee mooncake gifts dropped by 40% this year due to a difficult business climate and layoffs. This trend suggests that Chinese consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending, which is a concerning sign for the country's broader economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

This event will kick off a series of three consecutive supermoons, with the next two occurring in November and December.
