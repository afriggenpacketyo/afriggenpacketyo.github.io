          <p>A security officer at Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital near Chicago was shot and wounded during a struggle in the emergency room. The incident began when the C.A.R.E. team approached a man showing signs of a mental health issue near a Taco Bell and brought him to the hospital for evaluation. While in the ER, the man became agitated, leading to a confrontation with hospital staff and security, during which he lunged for his belongings, revealing a weapon, and shots were fired. The emergency room was placed on lockdown, and the 28-year-old man was taken into police custody after being subdued by security and another hospital employee. The quick response of the hospital personnel was lauded after the incident.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. This order responds to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at stifling free speech, while Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security and to combat antisemitism on campus. Harvard President Alan Garber indicated the university is creating contingency plans for international students if they cannot travel to campus.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has experienced numerous shifts, from Musk's initial criticism of Trump in 2016 to his eventual endorsement and appointment to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's tenure in the administration was marked by significant budget cuts and close collaboration with Trump, but tensions arose over a bipartisan spending bill, leading to public criticism and Musk's departure from his government position. The conflict escalated with personal attacks, including Musk suggesting Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case and Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts. The dynamic between the two figures highlights the complexities of political alliances and the potential for dramatic shifts in loyalty and cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused former President Biden's aides of illegally using an autopen to enact policies he claims Biden didn't support. Trump claimed he could identify executive orders signed with an autopen and alleged that aides used it to implement "open borders" and transgender rights policies without Biden's full awareness. Biden refuted these claims, stating that he made the decisions during his presidency and dismissing Trump's probe as a distraction. Republican senators will hold a hearing on the allegations, and a House committee issued a subpoena to Biden's physician as part of an investigation into Biden's cognitive state.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo High Court overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The district court had initially found four former executives liable for compensation, amounting to around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion), due to the impact of the earthquake and tsunami on the plant. The appeal trial focused on whether the management's decisions regarding tsunami countermeasures were appropriate, especially after a TEPCO unit estimated the potential for a 15.7-meter tsunami in 2008. The criminal suit acquitting two of the executives was finalized in March, and charges against the former chairman were dismissed after his death.</p>

          <p>As more retailers and food brands offer items with fewer ingredients, prompted by concerns around ultra-processed foods, nutritionists and food scientists are debating the health benefits of this trend. Some experts, like Dr. Laura Wyness, argue that leaving out fortified nutrients in pursuit of shorter ingredient lists can be detrimental to public health. Others, such as Dr. Jibin He, suggest that simplifying formulas and using novel processing technologies can create less processed products without sacrificing nutritional value. The debate highlights the complexity of defining healthy food and the need for consumers to be well-informed about their choices.</p>

          <p>Victims of the Los Angeles County fires have filed lawsuits against AAA and USAA, alleging the insurers systematically underestimated the replacement cost of their homes. The lawsuits claim fraud, negligence, and breach of contract, stating that policyholders were left without sufficient funds to rebuild after the fires. The suits also allege that the problem of underinsurance is pervasive and stems from faulty cost estimator software and other shortcomings. This legal action opens a new front in the litigation spawned by the catastrophic fires, which caused significant damage and loss of life.</p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space to assess their durability during space travel, signaling a move toward building an integrated space-ground system for secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket to test their robustness against vibration and radiation. The test is a crucial step in transitioning from experimental validation to constructing a fully integrated quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is seen as a highly secure communication method that skips the encryption key-sharing step.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that in many states, young offenders are denied credit for "dead time," or the time spent in detention awaiting trial, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. This practice adds months to the duration that kids are confined, negatively impacting their rehabilitation and wasting taxpayer resources. Experts argue that the lack of time credit stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to unequal application of fundamental rights. The investigation highlights the need for reforms to ensure fair treatment and access to services for young people in the juvenile justice system.</p>

Although sufficient penicillin was obtained for battle casualties shortly before D-Day, it was not fully available to the general public until 1946.
