          <p>A New York Times article details the Trump administration's plan to resettle a group of white South Africans, classified as refugees, in the United States. The administration plans to transport 54 Afrikaners on a charter flight from Johannesburg, citing racial persecution in South Africa as justification. This move contrasts with the suspension of nearly all other refugee admissions. The South African government disputes the refugee status claim, calling it politically motivated.

Activists plan new lawsuits against doctors prescribing the drug and lobbying to remove it from the market entirely. They cite a new report claiming mifepristone causes high rates of health complications, which reproductive health experts dispute. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals, with the DOJ asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access, while Marty Makary, Trump’s pick to lead the FDA, said that while he has “no plans” to restrict mifepristone, he “can’t promise” his agency won’t act on incoming safety data.

          <p>CBS News reports that President Trump's tariffs are increasing the prices of baby products, potentially costing parents up to $1,000 a year. The price hikes are affecting essential items such as car seats and strollers, with manufacturers citing the high import duties on Chinese goods. Amidst the rising costs, resale platforms are gaining popularity as parents seek discounted options.
