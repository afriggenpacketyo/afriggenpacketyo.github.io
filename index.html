          <p>New global tariffs implemented by the Trump administration are creating significant uncertainty for the U.S. retail industry as it enters the spring ordering season. Retail associations warn that the tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices, fewer product choices, and potential job losses, disrupting supply chains and planning. Many businesses, from small companies to large corporations like Amazon, are grappling with how to absorb the increased costs, with some pausing product releases and others risking inventory shortages. The added pressure is forcing CEOs to spend more time on tariff logistics than on business growth and strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Paula Deen has unexpectedly closed her iconic Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons, which she operated with her sons for nearly three decades. The establishment, along with a second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box, ceased operations without a public explanation for the shutdown. Deen's fame skyrocketed after the restaurant gained popularity for its Southern cuisine, leading to a Food Network show that was later canceled amid controversy. Her four other restaurants in different states will remain open, and she expressed gratitude to her loyal customers.</p>

This move follows a recent nine-hour meeting between Maxwell and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, where they reportedly discussed numerous names associated with Epstein.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's campaign pledge to ensure IVF treatment is covered for all Americans has yet to be fulfilled, leaving many advocates and families wondering about the delay. An executive order signed in February directed policy recommendations to be made by May, but that deadline passed without an update from the White House. With the high out-of-pocket cost of IVF being a major barrier for many, the issue has broad, nonpartisan support among the public. Advocates emphasize that federal action would be highly meaningful, as only a few states currently mandate insurance coverage for the procedure.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that the increasing number of urgent cases on the court's emergency docket is a result of presidential administrations from both parties using executive power to enact policy. Speaking at a judicial conference, he noted that presidents like Obama, Biden, and Trump have increasingly relied on executive orders and regulations, which are frequently and swiftly challenged in court. Kavanaugh also mentioned that the court is now providing more written explanations for its emergency orders than in the past. He described the collegiality among the justices as "very strong."</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited a controversial aid distribution site in Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israel- and US-backed initiative. The visit, intended to assess the humanitarian situation, has been labeled a "media stunt" by some Gazans who argue it fails to address the reality of the hunger crisis.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new reboot of 'The Naked Gun,' starring Liam Neeson, successfully revives the classic slapstick formula, offering a refreshing dose of pure farce in the current movie landscape. Neeson, known for his serious action roles, effectively steps into the shoes of Leslie Nielsen as the deadpan hero Frank Drebin Jr., making the surrounding absurdity even funnier. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the film prioritizes a high joke-per-minute rate over a complex plot, a style largely absent from modern mainstream comedy. The movie's commitment to inane gags provides a much-needed, enjoyable experience for audiences seeking straightforward, laugh-out-loud humor.</p>

          <p>California is leading a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit against the Trump administration's executive order targeting gender-affirming care. The suit challenges the order that directs the Justice Department to investigate and potentially prosecute healthcare providers of such care for minors, which has already created a chilling effect and led to clinic closures nationwide. The states argue the directive is an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority that undermines state laws protecting healthcare access. The lawsuit seeks to vacate the order, which critics call a cruel attack on vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth.</p>

The report was released alongside an EPA proposal to undo the 2009 "endangerment finding," which legally underpins the regulation of greenhouse gases. Critics, including esteemed scientist Michael Mann, argue the report cherry-picks data and uses long-debunked talking points to downplay the climate crisis.

          <p>As extreme heat becomes more common, personal neck cooling fans are gaining popularity as a way to find relief, but experts question their true effectiveness. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural cooling process of sweat evaporation. However, in high humidity, this effect is diminished, and the fans only cool a small surface area of the body. While they can make a person feel cooler due to the high concentration of thermal receptors on the face, researchers caution that this might create a false sense of security, potentially leading to overexertion in dangerous heat.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, annuities are an appealing option for securing retirement income, but making a smart choice requires understanding key guidelines. Financial experts suggest several rules, such as keeping total annual fees below 1% and not buying a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for it to mature. Another crucial step is to first calculate essential living expenses and ensure they are covered by guaranteed income sources like Social Security before purchasing an annuity. Additionally, it is often recommended to limit your total allocation to annuities to no more than 25% of your retirement portfolio to maintain diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced it will raise the U.S. prices for its original Switch family of systems and related products, effective August 3. The company cited "market conditions" as the reason for the price hike, which will affect the original Switch, Switch Lite, and OLED models, as well as some accessories. The price of the newly released Switch 2 console and its games will not change for now, though Nintendo noted future adjustments may be necessary. The announcement comes as companies navigate shifting U.S. tariff policies, which have created an uncertain economic environment for imported electronics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>U.S. Labor Market Shows Signs of Slowdown with Weak July Jobs Report</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of expectations. Compounding the weakness, the Bureau of Labor Statistics sharply revised down job growth for May and June by a combined 258,000, indicating the market was weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, while wage growth remained moderate. The slowdown, with job gains concentrated almost entirely in healthcare, raises concerns about the economy's trajectory as the Trump administration escalates its tariff policies.

          <p>Allergy experts are increasingly calling for the popular antihistamine diphenhydramine, commonly known as Benadryl, to be removed from over-the-counter markets due to its risks. In a recent review, experts from Johns Hopkins and UC San Diego argued the first-generation drug is outdated and poses dangers, especially to children and older adults, including cognitive impairment and accidental overdose. They contend that for every use case, from allergies to sleep aid, safer and more effective second-generation alternatives like cetirizine (Zyrtec) or loratadine (Claritin) exist. These newer medications offer better symptom control with significantly fewer side effects.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell approximately 7% after its second-quarter earnings report, as weaker-than-expected profit guidance and underwhelming cloud growth overshadowed strong overall results. While the company beat expectations on revenue and advertising sales, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth of 18% trailed the faster pace of rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon also signaled a significant increase in capital expenditures to over $118 billion for the year, primarily to support AI infrastructure demand.

In another instance, it mislabeled a photo of a Gazan child and his mother, shared by Senator Bernie Sanders, as being from Yemen in 2016.

This was compounded by the Trump administration's unveiling of new tariffs on dozens of countries, raising concerns about global trade and economic growth.
