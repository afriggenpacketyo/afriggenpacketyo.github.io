          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 09:20:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had only a marginal impact on prices for goods and services so far. While final demand goods prices rose, this was offset by a fall in services costs. Annually, the headline PPI increased by 2.3%, the lowest level since September 2024, providing a mixed signal for the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A chaotic aid distribution in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Palestinians. The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which runs the site, reported 19 people were trampled and one was stabbed, blaming armed individuals for fomenting unrest. However, local hospital officials and witnesses cited suffocation from a crush and the use of pepper spray by security contractors. The incident highlights the extreme desperation and breakdown of order amid severe aid shortages and ongoing violence in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Barclays Bank £42 million for significant failures in its anti-money laundering controls. The regulator found that Barclays did not properly vet two clients, Stunt & Co and WealthTek, thereby facilitating the movement of funds linked to financial crime. The FCA stated that Barclays' inadequate monitoring allowed Stunt & Co to receive millions from a known money laundering operation. The bank received a reduced fine due to its cooperation with the investigation and a voluntary payment to clients affected by the WealthTek case.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Co-op, Shirine Khoury-Haq, has apologized after confirming that a major cyberattack in April compromised the data of all 6.5 million of its members. The stolen information included names, addresses, and contact details, though no financial or transaction data was lost. Four individuals have been arrested and bailed in connection with the hack, which also affected retailer M&S. In response, Co-op is partnering with a cybersecurity recruitment firm to identify and train young talent for legal careers in the field.</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon utilized a rocket from its direct competitor, SpaceX, to launch 24 of its Project Kuiper internet satellites into orbit. This collaboration is driven by Amazon's need to meet a Federal Communications Commission deadline requiring it to deploy half of its planned 3,000-satellite constellation by July 2026. The launch underscores the intense competition and massive investment in the satellite internet market, a key battleground between billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. Amazon now has 78 Kuiper satellites in orbit as it races to catch up with SpaceX's dominant Starlink service.</p>

          <p>The ongoing British and Irish Lions rugby tour is being viewed as a crucial opportunity to revitalize rugby union in Australia, which has been struggling financially and losing popularity to rival sports like rugby league and Aussie Rules. Rugby Australia has faced significant financial losses and the collapse of a major team, the Melbourne Rebels. The tour, along with upcoming home World Cups in 2027 and 2029, is expected to generate massive revenue and reignite public interest. Stakeholders hope this 'golden decade' will showcase rugby's unique global appeal and help secure the sport's future in the country.</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise savers on the differences between certificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts, especially in a shifting interest rate environment. CDs are ideal for goals with a fixed timeline, as they lock in a specific interest rate, protecting savers from potential rate drops but penalizing early withdrawals. Money market accounts offer more liquidity and are better for emergency funds, though their variable rates will fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates.

          <p>Professional cycling teams at the Tour de France are increasingly adopting heat training to enhance rider performance. This method involves deliberately raising an athlete's core body temperature through methods like intense exercise in warm clothing or post-training saunas. Sports scientists claim this stressor is highly effective, potentially more so than traditional altitude training, as it can increase blood volume and stimulate red blood cell formation. The practice, once considered unusual, is now a mainstream strategy for top teams seeking a competitive edge in the grueling race.</p>

          <p>The media industry is experiencing a leadership transformation, with executives from finance and operational backgrounds increasingly taking top roles traditionally held by content programmers. This shift, exemplified by leaders at Warner Bros.

Analysts suggest this trend indicates that financial engineering is becoming as critical as creative programming for survival and growth in a perpetually disrupted landscape. The change is propelled by the need for a different mindset to navigate the sector's complex financial challenges.</p>

          <p>A prosecutor in Brazil has asked the Supreme Court to find former president Jair Bolsonaro guilty of plotting a violent coup to overturn his 2022 election loss. The prosecution argued that Bolsonaro and seven co-defendants engaged in an armed criminal association to overthrow the democratic order, a plot that allegedly failed because the military did not support it. The trial has drawn intervention from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called it a 'witch hunt' and threatened tariffs against Brazil.
