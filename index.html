          <p>The United States is experiencing the highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with over 1,200 cases reported across 34 states and the District of Columbia. A significant outbreak in West Texas has contributed to this surge, resulting in the deaths of two unvaccinated children, with the majority of infections affecting children and teenagers who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Measles is highly contagious and can lead to severe complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis, especially in unvaccinated individuals. Health officials emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, highlighting that vaccination rates have declined below the critical threshold needed for herd immunity, with government officials encouraging vaccination efforts to combat the outbreak. The article underscores the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates to protect communities from preventable diseases like measles. Optimism surrounding the situation is tempered by the ongoing outbreak and the need for increased vaccination efforts.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed the presence of radiological and chemical contamination within Iran's Natanz nuclear facility. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi informed the United Nations Security Council that uranium isotopes and hydrogen fluoride may have been dispersed inside the facility. Grossi also noted destruction at multiple sites in Iran, including Natanz, Isfahan, Arak, and Tehran, but stated that no radiological activity has been detected outside these facilities. He cautioned about potential attacks on the Bushehr nuclear facility, highlighting the serious consequences such an event could have, including the need for evacuations and sheltering of the population. The report raises concerns about the safety and security of Iran's nuclear sites amidst escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has taken a significant step towards legalizing assisted dying, with lawmakers approving a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to end their lives. The bill permits individuals aged 18 or older with a prognosis of fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval from two doctors and a review panel. Supporters argue that it provides individuals facing terminal illness with the right to end their suffering with dignity, while critics express concerns about potential pressures on vulnerable individuals. The legislation now moves to the House of Lords for further consideration, potentially marking one of the most significant social policy changes in decades.</p>

The GENIUS Act seeks to add consumer protections, collateral requirements, and regulatory oversight to the stablecoin market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan designed to significantly reduce drug review times for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." The plan aims to cut review times to one-to-two months for selected companies, focusing on areas such as addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. This initiative allows companies to submit the majority of a drug application before final clinical trial results are available, potentially streamlining the approval process. While this effort could positively impact the pharmaceutical industry by encouraging domestic manufacturing, concerns remain regarding the risks of accelerated reviews and the potential for political influence. The FDA will initially offer a limited number of vouchers to companies aligned with national health priorities.</p>

          <p>According to legal scholar John Yoo, President Trump does not require congressional approval to initiate military action against Iran, citing the president's authority as commander-in-chief. Yoo, who helped craft the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, acknowledges Congress's constitutional power to declare war but asserts the president can act swiftly in national defense. This perspective contrasts with some lawmakers who believe Congress should authorize any strike, emphasizing their constitutional role. The debate intensifies as resolutions in the Senate and House seek to require congressional debate and a vote before military force is used against Iran, which Yoo dismisses as political opportunism.</p>

Coastal residents, particularly in Acapulco, took the storm seriously, recalling the devastation of Hurricane Otis in 2023, and the remnants of Erick have since dissipated over the mountains.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles, potentially unraveling a key tool used to curb planet-heating emissions. The court sided with oil and gas companies and Republican-led states, allowing them to challenge a waiver that has permitted California to set tougher standards than national rules. This decision overturns a lower court ruling, asserting that the fuel industry has legal standing to challenge the EPA's decision to allow California to set its own regulations. Environmentalists and California's Democratic leadership defend the waiver, emphasizing its role in driving vehicle innovation and reducing greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Senator Lisa Murkowski's new memoir, "Far From Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.," reveals her journey as a consensus-building senator grounded in her Alaskan roots. Murkowski reflects on her 2010 write-in campaign victory, which taught her the importance of prioritizing her constituents' needs over party lines. She emphasizes the need for more problem-solvers in Congress and encourages citizens to get involved in their communities to strengthen American democracy. The memoir offers insights into her independent approach to legislating and her belief in the power of individual action.</p>

          <p>The conflict between Iran and Israel has raised questions about the stability of the Islamist regime in Tehran, which has been using the conflict to rally support. While the regime's perceived weakness in protecting its officials has sparked criticism, experts suggest that a collapse depends on the emergence of a viable political alternative. The Iranian opposition remains divided, and the regime has suppressed dissenting voices for decades. The sense of patriotism could play a crucial role, similar to the Iran-Iraq War, but it is difficult to ascertain the true feelings of the Iranian people amidst fear and anger.</p>

Oil rises as threats loom.
