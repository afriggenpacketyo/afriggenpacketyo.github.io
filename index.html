          <p>President Trump declared a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after weeks of escalating aerial attacks. The agreement, according to Trump, involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran, followed by Israel, with the war officially ending after 24 hours. However, neither Israeli nor Iranian officials immediately confirmed the agreement, and in the hours leading up to the supposed ceasefire, Iran launched missiles, resulting in casualties in Israel. This announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, escalating tensions in the region, and Iran firing missiles at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The situation remains tense as the durability of the ceasefire is uncertain. </p>

          <p>This article recounts the timeline of the Blaze Bernstein murder case, starting with his disappearance in January 2018 and the subsequent investigation that led to the arrest and conviction of Sam Woodward. The timeline details the discovery of messages between Bernstein and Woodward, the search for Bernstein, and the eventual discovery of his body in a shallow grave with multiple stab wounds. Woodward was later charged with murder, and the case was enhanced with a hate crime charge due to evidence suggesting that Bernstein was killed because he was gay. Woodward was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole, and Bernstein's parents started a movement called "BlazeItForward" to inspire acts of kindness in their son's memory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, potentially ending nearly two weeks of escalating air assaults. The proposed agreement included two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran, followed by Israel, to allow both countries to complete their final missions. Trump congratulated both nations for their courage and intelligence in ending what he termed 'THE 12 DAY WAR.' However, in the hours before the ceasefire was to take effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, causing casualties in Israel, and Iran's foreign minister initially denied any ceasefire agreement, though he indicated a willingness to halt strikes if Israel did so first.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, marking a significant advancement in using light for computation. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz, rivaling Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development addresses the limitations of traditional electronic chips and offers potential hardware acceleration for AI and data centers. This is especially important as US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices decreased to $66.57 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent fell to $69.50, reaching levels below those before Israel's attack on Iran. The market sell-off indicates investors' belief that the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some analysts suggesting a 'peace through strength' strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for the prevention of any loss of life.</p>

Fresh missiles were fired overnight, testing the durability of the ceasefire, as both countries have motivations to continue the conflict. The article questions whether Iran can trust Trump as a broker, considering his past stance on regime change, and whether Israel will restrain its military advantage.

          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, despite being the world's top producer, with Myanmar accounting for approximately 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. These imports are particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are less abundant and more valuable. This reliance has strengthened China's dominance in the global heavy rare earths supply chain, but the ongoing civil war in Myanmar poses supply chain risks, as armed groups have seized key mining sites, leading to disruptions and price spikes. The extraction methods used in Myanmar also come with high environmental costs, raising concerns about sustainability.</p>

          <p>Florida is constructing a detention center in the Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' to temporarily hold migrants. The facility, built on an air strip, aims to ramp up deportations of illegal migrants. The location is intended as a natural deterrent, with officials noting the presence of alligators and pythons. The mayor of Miami-Dade County criticized the plan, citing potential environmental damage, while the state's Attorney General assured the facility would not be within Everglades National Park.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that it will rescind the 2001 Roadless Rule, which protects 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups denounced the decision, citing the potential for habitat fragmentation, ecosystem disruption, and increased erosion and sediment pollution in drinking water. Opponents also disputed the claim that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk.</p>

An Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security praised the ruling, tweeting, "Fire up the deportation planes."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump took a gamble by inserting the US into the conflict between Israel and Iran, but it may have paid off with a possible ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire that he said could lead to a lasting peace. The development comes after a tumultuous day in the region, when Iran followed through on its promise to retaliate for Saturday's US strike. According to early reports, all the Iranian missiles directed at the massive US base in Qatar were intercepted and there were no American casualties or damage.</p>
