            <h2>UK Government Rushes Through Legislation to Secure British Steel Plant</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The British government swiftly enacted emergency legislation to take control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, averting a potential crisis. Government officials were stationed near the plant awaiting Royal Assent to finalize the law, which was expedited due to concerns about raw material sales by the Chinese-owned Jingye. The move aims to secure necessary resources and maintain operations at the two blast furnaces, with the possibility of full nationalization looming. The situation highlights the complexities of international supply chains and trade turmoil. Optimism remains that the changed law will allow the plant to continue operations.</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy surged to the top of the leaderboard at the Masters with a stellar six-under 66, giving him a two-shot lead over Bryson DeChambeau heading into the final round. McIlroy's performance included two eagles and showcased his maturity as he seeks to complete the career Grand Slam. DeChambeau closed the gap with birdies on his final holes, setting up a tantalizing Sunday showdown. Corey Conners, Patrick Reed, and Ludvig Aberg are also in contention, while defending champion Scottie Scheffler remains in striking distance.</p>

            <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man erroneously deported to El Salvador, is alive and being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center. The confirmation came after a federal court demanded details on his status, but the department did not specify steps to facilitate his return to the U.S., which the Supreme Court had ordered. President Trump acknowledged the U.S.'s power to bring Abrego Garcia back and is scheduled to meet with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Abrego Garcia's attorneys are seeking additional relief, including holding the government in contempt for non-compliance with court orders.</p>

            <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. military to assume control of federal land along the southern border spanning California, New Mexico, and Arizona to combat illegal immigration. The memorandum designates a 60-foot-deep strip within the Roosevelt Reservation as a "military installation" and "National Defense Area." This move aims to bolster border security through barrier construction and equipment deployment. The Roosevelt Reservation was established in 1907 to secure the border, and the Secretary of Defense will determine necessary military activities.</p>

            <p>Scottie Scheffler, typically a frontrunner, finds himself in the unfamiliar position of chasing Rory McIlroy at the Masters. Scheffler, who has won the tournament twice, struggled to an even-par 72, leaving him well behind McIlroy's lead. His round was marked by mistakes and scrambles, highlighting the difficulty of playing catch-up when his finely tuned game is slightly out of sync. McIlroy's strong performance put pressure on Scheffler, who is accustomed to leading from the front.</p>

            <p>President Trump is urging Congress to pass legislation making daylight saving time permanent, aiming to eliminate the biannual clock changes. He emphasized the popularity of the move and highlighted the inconvenience and cost associated with changing clocks. The Sunshine Protection Act, reintroduced by Florida Republicans, seeks to establish permanent daylight saving time. While some support the change, medical experts caution that a permanent standard time may be more beneficial for overall health.</p>

            <p>President Trump's changing tariff policies are creating panic buying and paralysis among US consumers. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, have led to concerns about price hikes and potential shortages. Some consumers are stocking up, while others feel uncertain about how to proceed. The tariffs have been revised, with some exemptions granted, but the overall impact is expected to raise costs for American families and potentially weaken the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House indicated the move was to allow companies more time to move production to the US, but the 20% tariff related to fentanyl remains in effect for these goods. (not investment advice)</p>

Spieth explained that mud balls, a regular feature at Augusta National, significantly affected his iron play, particularly on holes 11 and 13. He expressed frustration that players are discouraged from discussing the issue, which can impact scores. Spieth believes the mud is due to the mowing pattern and that it affects nearly every drive.</p>
