          <p>House Republicans are navigating a critical procedural vote on President Trump's extensive domestic policy bill, facing significant internal opposition. Despite a self-imposed July 4 deadline, securing enough support for the legislation remains uncertain, especially after the Senate's revisions introduced deeper Medicaid cuts and a higher debt limit increase. Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump are actively lobbying holdouts, emphasizing the bill's benefits, including substantial tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense. The process has been complicated by defections from both moderate and hardline conservatives, highlighting the fragile unity within the GOP as they push to pass this signature second-term agenda item.</p>

          <p>A fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, Northern California, experienced multiple explosions and a subsequent fire, leaving seven people unaccounted for. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics prompted mandatory evacuations and resulted in several structures catching fire, with flames spreading into 80 acres of grass. While two people were injured and received medical care, no confirmed deaths have been reported yet, though families are desperately seeking contact with missing loved ones. Officials are actively working to determine the whereabouts of the missing individuals, including an 18-year-old on his first day of work. The cause of the explosion is under investigation, with local residents describing their homes shaking from the blasts, and power outages affecting nearly 2,200 customers.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault in his federal trial in New York City. However, he was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, each carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years. Combs will remain in detention, with sentencing proposed for October 3, and preliminary calculations suggesting a sentence of four to five years. The verdict prompted visible relief from Combs, who made prayer hands and expressed gratitude to the jury. His attorneys argued for immediate release with a million-dollar bond and travel restrictions, but bail was denied, underscoring the court's view on the seriousness of the convictions under the Mann Act.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has reportedly rescinded its export restrictions on chip design software to China, as announced by U.S.-based Synopsys. This development suggests a potential easing of trade tensions between the two nations, with Synopsys indicating its efforts to restore access to its previously restricted products in the Chinese market. Earlier in May, the U.S. had imposed requirements for chip design software companies, including Synopsys, to obtain licenses for exporting goods like software and chemicals for semiconductors to China. The U.S. Commerce Department has not yet publicly commented on this significant policy shift, leaving further details of the apparent "trade truce" to emerge.</p>

His attorneys filed new allegations in a Maryland federal court, detailing forced kneeling for hours, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and a significant 31-pound weight loss. Despite a previous court order for his return, Abrego Garcia was sent to CECOT, where he claims prison officials acknowledged his tattoos were not gang-related, contrary to Trump administration allegations of MS-13 affiliation. He was eventually returned to the U.S. but faces human smuggling charges, with his lawyers now seeking to prevent further deportation to an unspecified "third country."</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are witnessing a robust resurgence, with new listing volumes jumping eightfold to $14 billion in the first half of the year, primarily driven by Chinese companies seeking fundraising. This significant surge positions the city to potentially become the world's largest listing destination this year, surpassing Nasdaq and NYSE. The renewed interest is fueled by a confluence of factors, including Beijing's supportive regulatory policies, a muted pace of A-share listings, ample market liquidity, and delisting concerns in U.S. markets. Chinese firms are increasingly choosing Hong Kong for dual listings to fund globalization strategies and navigate geopolitical tensions, reflecting growing confidence in the city's market.

Bacon argued that voting against this article would effectively raise income taxes for middle-class Americans by about 20%, translating to approximately $1,700 more annually for Nebraskan families. While he prefers the House's original Medicaid bill, he defended the core changes as primarily focused on work requirements for able-bodied adults. The legislation, which includes significant tax cuts and new immigration spending, faces opposition from both moderate Republicans concerned about insurance loss and conservatives worried about national debt. Speaker Johnson remains optimistic about its passage by the July 4 deadline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's policy that restricts migrants crossing the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by attempting to "adopt an alternative immigration system" and that neither the Constitution nor federal immigration law grants the President unilateral authority to limit asylum rights. The executive order, issued in January, had declared the border situation an "invasion" and suspended asylum access. Despite a recent Supreme Court ruling limiting judges' power on nationwide injunctions, Judge Moss deemed this a "rare case" requiring such relief. The decision, hailed by the ACLU, is stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, publicly demanding his immediate resignation via a Truth Social post. Trump linked his call to a news article about a federal housing regulator seeking an investigation into Powell's testimony regarding renovations at the central bank's Washington headquarters. Despite nominating Powell during his first term, Trump has repeatedly criticized him for not cutting interest rates, though he previously stated no intention of firing him. Powell recently suggested that Trump's tariff policies had prevented earlier rate cuts.

          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that investigations into historical child sexual exploitation cases were significantly delayed due to Manchester City Council's heavy redactions of evidence. Some material provided by the council contained pages with only a few visible words, making it impossible to assess the evidential value. The council cited "complex" data-sharing rules, fearing jeopardized prosecutions if all information was included, and noted a new process has since been agreed. This article highlights the challenges in multi-agency cooperation on sensitive cases, such as Operations Green Jacket and Bernese, and underscores ongoing efforts to improve information-sharing protocols to support victims and bring offenders to justice.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that women under 55 with a uterus who use estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy for menopause symptoms may face a higher risk of breast cancer. Conversely, the study found that estrogen-only therapy reduced breast cancer risk in women without a uterus. This research refines previous understandings from the early 2000s, which were criticized for problematic design and focused on older women. Dr. CÃ©line Gounder emphasized that this evolving science focuses on real-life scenarios, where women begin treatment around menopause. The article stresses the importance of consulting doctors to assess individual risks and benefits, considering factors like family history, to determine the appropriate treatment for each person.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminology PhD student accused in the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, has pleaded guilty to all charges as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty. During a court hearing, Kohberger admitted to the brutal killings of Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogen, waiving his right to appeal or seek leniency. He is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, plus 10 years for burglary. The plea deal, which has divided victims' familiesâ€”some seeking full confession, others closureâ€”means lingering questions about his motives and the full details of the crime may remain unanswered. Sentencing is scheduled for July 23.</p>

Surveillance footage and cell phone data also placed Kohberger's vehicle near the house multiple times before the killings.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study indicates that nearly half of Latino voters supported Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, a notable increase from 2020. While Kamala Harris secured a slight majority, Trump garnered 48% of the Latino vote, significantly up from 36%. Experts suggest this shift isn't necessarily ideological but reflects economic populism and disillusionment with the Democratic Party's immigration policies. Political consultants Mike Madrid and Paola Ramos discuss the "deep disillusionment" among Latinos who felt betrayed by unfulfilled promises and perceived rewards for those entering outside the system.

          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson, Sean Parnell, stated that intelligence assessments suggest U.S. strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities last month have set back Iran's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's earlier claim that the sites were "obliterated." The evolving intelligence picture, which includes material suggesting centrifuge destruction even if the facilities themselves weren't entirely caved in, comes as the head of the UN nuclear watchdog warned Iran could be producing enriched uranium in a few months. Iran has since suspended cooperation with the IAEA, further complicating verification efforts and drawing condemnation from the U.S. State Department.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing renewed pressure to stabilize government finances after major concessions on welfare reforms severely dented projected savings. With her Â£10 billion buffer almost eliminated, the article outlines five potential options ahead of the Autumn Budget. These include waiting for economic growth, finding new savings (despite recent departmental budget allocations), changing self-imposed financial rules (which she strongly opposes), adopting less frequent financial checks, or increasing taxes/extending threshold freezes. Labour has pledged not to raise taxes for "working people," leaving limited levers to replenish coffers and address the financial consequences of policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>
