          <p>Over 1,000 LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families undertook a Jubilee pilgrimage through St. Peter’s Basilica, marking the first time such an event was listed on the Vatican’s official Holy Year calendar. This inclusion, occurring under Pope Leo XIV's early papacy and following Pope Francis's welcoming gestures, has been celebrated by participants as a sign of acceptance, while critics condemn it as undermining Church tradition. Vatican officials clarified the listing was logistical, not an endorsement, amidst sharp online divides regarding the event's significance.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan experienced a viral incident at a game when an adult woman took a home run ball, initially given to him by his father, from his possession. Following the dispute, the boy received a gift bag from the Miami Marlins staff and later met Phillies player Harrison Bader, who gave him an autographed bat. This heartwarming resolution highlighted the spirit of sportsmanship after an unfortunate display of adult behavior.</p>

          <p>Chicago is preparing for heightened immigration enforcement this weekend, with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson strongly criticizing President Trump's social media posts threatening federal intervention. Trump's image suggesting military action in Chicago, referencing the "Department of War," drew accusations of authoritarianism from local leaders. A White House spokeswoman, however, cited Chicago's crime rates, defending the federal focus on "worst of the worst" criminals in sanctuary cities. The increased ICE activity has led to the postponement of Chicago's Mexican Independence Day festival.</p>

At their recent conference, several hopefuls, including Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, were thrust into the spotlight. The party aims to recruit 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections, strengthening its infrastructure and moving towards a more rigorous selection process to avoid past scandals, as it eyes significant gains in local and national politics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming November Budget will be shaped by recent market volatility and cabinet changes, despite her secure position. Global bond market fragility, not solely UK-specific issues, has been a key factor, with long-term borrowing rates fluctuating. Reeves dismissed talks of a "black hole" and IMF loans, emphasizing the need for fiscal discipline through higher taxes or spending cuts rather than increased debt. The Office for Budget Responsibility's judgment on UK productivity will be crucial in determining the extent of necessary adjustments, as the government aims for pro-growth reforms amidst ongoing economic pressures.

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, co-founded "Sisters in Service" to provide support and recognition for female military veterans. The group, which includes 160 members, addresses the unique challenges women face after leaving the armed forces, often due to misconceptions about their combat roles. Many female veterans feel isolated and avoid traditional support spaces like Royal British Legion clubs, where their service may be presumed to be secondary. This article highlights the "cathartic" community Sisters in Service offers, enabling women to connect and discuss shared experiences.</p>

          <p>Egypt's "Great Transfiguration Project" to transform the sacred Mount Sinai, a UNESCO World Heritage site, into a luxury mega-resort is facing significant backlash.

The Greek Orthodox Church also voiced alarm over a court ruling on St. Catherine's Monastery land.

          <p>An investigative report into the deadly Lisbon funicular crash revealed that a cable linking the two cabins snapped shortly before the derailment, which killed 16 and injured 21.

          <p>Eleven people, including children and a baby, are missing after a hippopotamus capsized their boat on the Sassandra River in southwestern Ivory Coast. The incident occurred near Buyo, with only three survivors rescued from the narrow, canoe-like vessel. This tragic event highlights the dangers of human-wildlife interactions, as hippos are frequently cited in incidents causing deaths or injuries in Ivory Coast. Boat accidents are also common in the region due to overloaded vessels navigating between communities.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has distanced itself from Aseem Malhotra, an adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after he made unsubstantiated claims at their conference linking Covid vaccines to the cancers of the King and Princess of Wales. Malhotra also suggested mRNA vaccines could alter genes and were more harmful than the virus itself. The party stated it does not endorse his views but believes in free speech, while Health Secretary Wes Streeting condemned giving a platform to "poisonous lies." Medical professionals have widely discredited Malhotra's claims, emphasizing vaccine safety and efficacy.</p>

          <p>A US government lab has achieved a "game-changing" breakthrough in fusion energy, successfully creating "burning plasma" through a self-contained feedback loop. The Los Alamos National Laboratory-led team utilized a new diagnostic device called "THOR" (Thinned Hohlraum Optimization for Radflow) to better observe how materials react to extreme plasma conditions. This achievement, building on previous ignition successes, is a significant step towards realizing nearly unlimited, clean energy without long-lasting nuclear waste or meltdown risks, contrasting with fission reactors. The article notes the information gathered also has implications for weapons development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, an FBI most-wanted fugitive suspected of two 2003 bombings linked to animal rights extremism, faces extradition to the US after 21 years on the run. He was found last year in a remote Welsh cottage, having evaded authorities since a high-speed chase in California where a "bomb-making factory" was discovered in his abandoned car. Former FBI agents recall "missed opportunities" to arrest him earlier. San Diego is indicted for maliciously damaging property with explosives, and his capture underscores the FBI's long-term commitment to accountability.</p>

The primary threats include strong, damaging wind gusts, isolated large hail, and a slight risk of brief tornadoes.

While violent crime rates have fallen, residents like Rob White on the South Side argue that community-led initiatives are the true "troops" against violence, not federal militarization. In contrast, some residents in Canaryville welcome federal intervention.

Trump, who was previously booed at the tournament in 2015, will likely draw significant attention, potentially overshadowing the match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.
