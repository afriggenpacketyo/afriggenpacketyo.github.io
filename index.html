          <p>A business school professor and CEO advises job seekers to ask a specific question during interviews to uncover a company's true values: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers, revealing the actual work culture beyond corporate platitudes. Examples of revealing responses include mentions of weekend work expectations, preferences for specialists over generalists, or a dislike for overly social employees. By asking this, candidates can better assess if a company's real operational values align with their own personal and professional preferences before accepting an offer.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom championed the changes, arguing that the 1970s-era law had become a bureaucratic obstacle to building much-needed housing. The new legislation aims to streamline the approval process for development projects, a move supported by housing advocates but opposed by some environmental groups. This reform was a key condition for Newsom's approval of the state budget, which also included cuts to other progressive initiatives to close a deficit.</p>

Airports are experiencing flooding, bridges are being compromised by extreme heat, and power grids are failing under the strain of more frequent and intense storms. According to risk analytics, a significant percentage of power, telecommunications, and airport infrastructure faces major risk from floods, wind, or wildfires. Experts warn that much of the nation's infrastructure was designed for a past climate and requires substantial investment and scientific guidance to become resilient against future threats.</p>

          <p>A beachgoer in Walton County, Florida, discovered a large quantity of cocaine, valued at nearly $500,000, that had washed up on the shore. The 25 kilos of narcotics were found in packages featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The Walton County Sheriff's Office confiscated the drugs and warned the public not to touch any suspicious packages they might find, as the contents could be dangerous. This discovery is the latest in a series of incidents where large amounts of illegal drugs, often in distinct packaging, have washed up on Florida's beaches.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated it may investigate the U.S. citizenship of New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The consideration follows a call from a Republican congressman to revoke Mamdani's citizenship on the grounds that he may have concealed support for terrorism during his naturalization process. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and became a U.S. citizen in 2018, has faced intense scrutiny and Islamophobic attacks for his vocal support of Palestinian rights. This move aligns with a broader Trump administration directive to prioritize denaturalization proceedings for foreign-born citizens convicted of certain offenses.</p>

          <p>For savers whose certificates of deposit (CDs) are maturing in July 2025, the current lower-interest-rate environment presents new challenges. This article advises against allowing CDs to automatically roll over, as new rates will likely be lower than those secured in previous years. Instead, savers should actively shop for the best available rates, particularly from online banks, before anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts further depress yields. It also suggests considering long-term CDs to lock in current rates for several years, providing a stable return even if overall market rates continue to decline. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's strategy of leveraging itself to acquire over 528,000 Bitcoin has caused its stock to surge over 3,300% since 2020, far outpacing Bitcoin itself and inspiring other firms to explore similar treasury strategies.
