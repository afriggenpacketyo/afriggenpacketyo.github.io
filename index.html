        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are reducing hiring and not replacing departing workers, causing a decline in job vacancies. The number of available jobs has decreased by 63,000 between March and May, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.6%, the highest in nearly four years. This trend is attributed to firms attempting to offset increased employment costs, such as higher National Insurance contributions and minimum wage, potentially leading to further increases in unemployment. While average wages have slowed to a 5.2% increase, they remain above the inflation rate, highlighting the complex economic pressures facing UK businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to appeal a court order that would allow noncitizens deported to El Salvador to challenge their detentions. A judge had ruled that these individuals, deported under the Alien Enemies Act, have the right to contest their detentions as unlawful. The administration invoked the Act, an 18th-century wartime authority, to deport alleged migrant gang members, arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a "hybrid criminal state" invading the U.S. Critics argue that these deportees, many without criminal records, are being denied due process, while the White House insists the judge lacks the authority to intervene in immigration matters.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, stating the committee had become a rubber stamp for vaccines and that a clean sweep was needed to restore public confidence. This decision has been met with criticism from medical groups, who argue it disrupts a transparent process that has saved lives and silences independent medical expertise. Kennedy's move follows months of controversy over his handling of public health agencies, including changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance and spreading misinformation about measles shots. Experts have raised concerns about Kennedy's potential conflicts of interest due to his history of suing vaccine manufacturers.</p>

          <p>A provision in the House-approved "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could make it more difficult for low-income taxpayers to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Starting in 2028, the measure would require precertification of each qualifying child for filers claiming the EITC. Policy experts warn that these new rules could burden eligible filers, causing some to forgo the credit, and potentially delay tax refunds, particularly given IRS resource constraints. The provision aims to prevent erroneous claims, but critics argue that it could overwhelm the IRS with documentation.</p>

          <p>A legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has unfolded, stemming from accusations of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us" and a subsequent smear campaign. Lively accused Baldoni of creating a hostile work environment, while Baldoni filed a lawsuit against The New York Times for libel and false light invasion of privacy. The case sheds light on crisis management tactics used to shape celebrity narratives and the ease with which social media users turn against female celebrities. On June 9, 2025, a federal judge threw out Justin Baldoni’s countersuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and publicist Leslie Sloane, and the New York Times.</p>

          <p>Scrapping the two-child benefit cap could lift up to 470,000 children out of poverty by allowing low-income families to claim an extra £3,513 per year in universal credit for each additional child. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated a willingness to consider lifting the cap, which was implemented by the Conservative government in 2017. There are 1.2 million families with three or more children in the UK, and around 370,000 of these are households on universal credit, and removing the cap could cost the government £3.5bn in 2029/30.</p>
