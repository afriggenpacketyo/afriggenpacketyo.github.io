          <p>After a decade-long search, William Greer, a suspect in the 2006 disappearance of Tammy Myers, was apprehended in Mexico thanks to a missing toe, a detail that earned the investigation the moniker "Operation Catch a Toe."

Bates' dedication inspired law enforcement and kept her mother's case alive for many years. Greer was eventually convicted of second-degree manslaughter after a plea deal, but Bates continues to search for her mother's remains in a wooded area of Cleveland, Texas, with the help of volunteers.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will remain at their current levels, even though a trade deal between Washington and Beijing has yet to be finalized.

The announcement follows high-level trade talks in London, where both sides reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus. China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%.</p>

          <p>Some parents are adding their young children, even toddlers, as authorized users on their credit cards in an effort to help them establish credit early. A survey from LendingTree indicates that about one in four parents have authorized a child under 18 on their credit or debit card. Financial advisors say it's never too early to start building credit, as a good credit score can lead to better rates on mortgages, car loans, and even employment opportunities. Parents are advised to pay their bills in full and on time and monitor for unapproved purchases.</p>
