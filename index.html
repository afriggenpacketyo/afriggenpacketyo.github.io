          <p>The stock market experienced a downturn as a reaction to President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff policies and his criticisms of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has publicly pressured Powell to lower interest rates, adding to market uncertainty.

          <p>Thousands of properties in west Devon, including homes and schools, are still affected by a burst water pipe that occurred on Monday, with approximately 9,500 properties experiencing a loss of water supply or reduced water pressure. South West Water (SWW) is working to restore supplies, but the process is complex and time-consuming. Compensation payments will be available to affected customers, and bottled water stations have been set up to provide temporary relief. The situation has prompted local officials to demand a timeline for full restoration and criticize the adequacy of current water provisions.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party is pushing for a ban on police recording non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs) in England and Wales, except in limited circumstances, arguing that they waste police time. NCHIs are defined as acts perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice but do not constitute a criminal offense. Critics argue that the plan is unworkable and would hinder the monitoring of serious antisemitism and other racist incidents. The debate highlights differing views on the role of police in addressing hate and the balance between freedom of speech and protecting vulnerable groups.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations with Washington over higher levies. One proposal involves raising the import amount to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons. This move comes amid growing calls in Japan for more affordable imported rice due to rising prices and supply shortages. The decision reflects a need to balance protecting domestic farmers with addressing consumer demands and trade relations with the United States.</p>

The slowdown comes amid fears of a global trade war and concerns about economic uncertainty, potentially leading consumers to reduce spending on discretionary items like Disney vacations.

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, are pressing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth for information on the military's compliance with court rulings blocking President Trump's attempted ban on transgender troops. The senators are seeking clarification on whether any transgender servicemembers have been prematurely dismissed and what steps are being taken to ensure their continued service without facing discrimination. The letter underscores the ongoing debate over transgender rights in the military and the administration's policies towards transgender individuals.</p>
