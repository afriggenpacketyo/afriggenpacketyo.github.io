          <p>Weekly mortgage application volume experienced a slight dip, even as interest rates saw only a minuscule increase, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinance demand decreased by 3%, while applications for home purchases remained largely unchanged with a marginal 0.1% rise, though still at their strongest pace in four weeks. Despite prevailing economic headwinds and affordability concerns, prospective homebuyers are showing more activity compared to the previous year, demonstrating resilience. The broader bond market and mortgage rates have maintained a notably narrow range recently, indicating a period of relative stability for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pierce Brosnan, who famously portrayed James Bond from 1995 to 2002, has expressed a humorous willingness to return to the iconic role if director Denis Villeneuve were to take on the project. The actor acknowledged his age but highlighted the potential for great entertainment and comedic elements, even joking about needing prosthetics. Brosnan and his wife are keenly observing Amazon's creative direction for the franchise after its acquisition of MGM. Other figures in the Bond universe, including Helen Mirren and villain actor Robert Davi, have also shared their perspectives on the character's traditional gender and the desire to avoid what they term "woke" influences.</p>

          <p>Walmart has initiated a recall of Great Value brand frozen, raw shrimp across 13 U.S. states due to concerns about potential radioactive contamination. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested the recall after detecting Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, in shipping containers and a sample of breaded shrimp imported from Indonesia. While the detected levels were low, the FDA warns of a "potential health concern" from long-term exposure. Consumers who purchased shrimp with specific lot codes and best-by dates are urged to discard or return the products for a refund.</p>

An individual has been arrested, and the situation is now under control, though potential delays and cancellations are anticipated at the busy hub. No injuries have been reported, and airport firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, but heavy smoke necessitated the evacuation for safety reasons.</p>

          <p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the rap group Kneecap, appeared in a London court on a terror charge for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a gig last year. The 27-year-old denies the charge, calling the case "political" and an attempt to silence his band. Supported by a large crowd with Palestinian flags, Ó hAnnaidh's defense team is seeking to dismiss the case, arguing a technical error in the charge's timing. The case has been adjourned until September, with the rapper remaining on unconditional bail.</p>

The shooting, motivated by the gunman's discontent with vaccines, resulted in the death of a police officer and the shooter.

Firefighters face challenges in dousing a heat cavity within the trunk, exploring options like scaffolding or water drops.

          <p>Microplastics, tiny plastic particles increasingly found in human bodies and the food supply, are becoming a significant health concern, posing a vulnerability for the fossil fuel industry. Petrochemicals, derived from oil and gas, are the building blocks of plastics, making any pushback against plastic use a threat to the industry. Recent research indicates a surge in microplastic studies, with one finding a 50% increase in plastic in human brains from 2016 to 2024. While the industry highlights plastics' benefits, environmental advocates argue they cannot dismiss the implications of daily human exposure, especially as oil companies invest heavily in chemical production.</p>

An article in Clinical & Experimental Allergy suggests at least four new foods—goat/sheep milk, buckwheat, peas/lentils, and pine nuts—should be added to the UK and EU's current list of 14 common allergens. This recommendation stems from an analysis of nearly 3,000 European anaphylaxis cases, where these emerging allergens caused 413 incidents, including two deaths. The Food Standards Agency acknowledges the need for clear allergen information, while Allergy UK calls for full ingredient labeling and monitors new trends.</p>

          <p>The UK's inflation rate rose to 3.8% in the year to July, marking its highest level since January 2024 and remaining above the Bank of England's 2% target. This increase was primarily fueled by a significant jump in air fares, likely due to school holiday timing, and a continued rise in food prices, particularly for beef, chocolate, and coffee. Economists anticipate this higher-than-expected inflation will lead the Bank of England to slow the pace of interest rate cuts. The cost of living continues to strain household finances, with concerns about future food production impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article highlights a significant disparity in how conservatives and liberals cultivate young talent for the "ideas industry." Conservatives have established numerous well-funded programs, like the Buckley and Publius fellowships, offering paid opportunities and mentorship from influential figures. These programs immerse young people in political thought and connect them with the conservative institutional world, bridging the gap between abstract philosophy and policy. In contrast, liberals lack a comparable talent pipeline, often relying on traditional, less ideologically focused academic or media internships. This gap, the article argues, stems from liberalism's historical intellectual dominance and a professional approach that has inadvertently ceded the ideological field to conservatives.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military is mobilizing approximately 60,000 reservists in preparation for a planned ground offensive to capture and occupy Gaza City. This move comes after indirect ceasefire and hostage release talks with Hamas broke down. While regional mediators have presented a new truce proposal, Israel insists on a comprehensive deal for all hostages. The IDF states troops are already operating in Zeitoun and Jabalia, and civilians are being urged to evacuate south to mitigate harm. International bodies and allies have expressed grave concerns about the potential humanitarian impact.</p>

          <p>Experts are cautioning against grilling cured meats like hot dogs and bacon due to the formation of dangerous, carcinogenic nitrosamines when nitrites in these products react with high heat. While nitrites are used as preservatives and for color in processed meats, they can convert into toxic compounds. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has classified ten nitrosamines found in food as carcinogenic, warning that current intake levels pose a public health risk. Although new EU regulations will reduce permitted nitrite levels from October 2025, a coalition of experts advocates for a complete ban, citing safer natural alternatives already used in some European countries.</p>

Many, like 84-year-old Alfred Dasugo, struggle with housing and financial insecurity as temporary aid expires and rebuilding is slow. Advocates highlight long-standing socio-economic disparities, language barriers, and a focus on homeowner assistance over renter support as systemic failures. A report indicates high rates of PTSD and increased domestic violence among Filipino survivors, underscoring the profound and ongoing challenges faced by this community, many of whom were the backbone of the island's tourism industry.</p>

          <p>As climate change shortens winters, ticks are migrating to new regions, potentially introducing new diseases, but inadequate surveillance leaves doctors unprepared. Biologists are finding species like deer ticks, known carriers of Lyme disease, in previously unaffected areas. Infectious disease specialists emphasize that knowing which ticks are prevalent is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment, as patients often present with general symptoms. However, a 2023 survey revealed that only about a quarter of health departments conduct tick surveillance, and funding limitations often prioritize other vector-borne diseases.

          <p>Legionnaire's disease, a severe bacterial pneumonia, is increasingly spreading, particularly in cities like New York, with outbreaks linked to climate change and aging infrastructure.
