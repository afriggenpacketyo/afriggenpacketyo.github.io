          <p>Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is urging a significant overhaul of current net-zero policies, arguing that relying on limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is unrealistic and will ultimately fail. In a new report by the Tony Blair Institute, he emphasizes that voters feel they are being asked to make sacrifices without seeing a substantial impact on global emissions. Blair calls for greater investment in carbon capture technology, AI for energy grid efficiency, and small-scale nuclear reactors, while also advocating for climate change mitigation measures and international cooperation to persuade China and India to reduce emissions. The report also warns against alarmist rhetoric in climate debates, which Blair believes is counterproductive.</p>

          <p>Swedish police have confirmed that three people were killed in a shooting in Uppsala, Sweden, which took place at a hair salon near Vaksala Square in the city center. The shooter reportedly fled the scene on a scooter and remains at large, prompting a major police search involving a helicopter. The incident occurred on the eve of the Walpurgis spring festival, a time when large crowds typically gather in Uppsala, a city known for its university. Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer has called the shooting a "brutal act of violence," as concerns rise over increasing shootings and gang violence in Sweden.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising credit card debt and high interest rates, many Americans are considering bankruptcy as a debt relief solution. Chapter 7 bankruptcy allows for the liquidation of unsecured debts, such as credit card balances, but may require giving up non-exempt assets. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves a repayment plan over three to five years, allowing individuals to protect assets while paying back a portion of their debt. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt settlement, debt management plans, and debt consolidation loans, each offering different approaches to managing overwhelming debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposed peace plan by Donald Trump, urging Ukraine to make significant concessions to end the war with Russia, is facing rejection from many Ukrainians. The plan reportedly involves US recognition of Russia's control over Crimea and occupied territories, as well as barring Ukraine from joining NATO. Ukrainian officials have stated that they are ready for negotiations but not for surrender, with some analysts suggesting that Trump's views are influenced by a Russian-centric perspective.

          <p>President Donald Trump personally contacted Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after a report surfaced that Amazon was considering displaying U.S. tariff costs on its product listings. Shortly after the call, Amazon downplayed the plan and ultimately scrapped it. The White House criticized Amazon's potential move as a "hostile and political act." The incident follows a report that Amazon complied with Beijing's request to remove customer reviews from a book of Chinese President Xi Jinping's speeches, and comes as Bezos has been seen cozying up to Trump.</p>
