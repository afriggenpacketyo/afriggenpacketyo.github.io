          <p>According to multiple sources, including a senior intelligence official and a Department of Defense official, President Trump is contemplating joining Israel in a multiday operation targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, with Fordo being a possible target. Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment site, is heavily fortified and believed to be crucial to Iran's nuclear program. While there isn't complete agreement among Trump's advisors on how to proceed, the issue was discussed in a White House Situation Room meeting with key national security officials. Trump has suggested potential U.S. involvement through posts on Truth Social, raising questions about the extent of U.S. participation in the conflict.</p>

Meanwhile, the Israeli Transport Minister Miri Regev stated that the country is working to bring back stranded citizens from abroad, with an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 Israelis currently overseas. El Al, Israel's largest airline, will conduct rescue flights from destinations including Larnaca, Athens, Rome, Milan, and Paris, and some Israelis have already arrived by sea.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's federalization of the state's National Guard troops amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated they might have limited power to rule against the president's authority to deploy troops. California argues that the federalization of the National Guard is an unlawful executive action that diverts resources from critical work such as wildfire prevention. The court did not issue a ruling, but the case revolves around the president's power as commander-in-chief versus state sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies in the rapidly growing humanoid robotics sector are offering salaries more than three times the national urban average to attract engineers and AI specialists. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with higher salaries for those with more experience. This surge in pay stands out in China's subdued hiring landscape, which is under pressure from slowing economic growth and corporate earnings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could flourish in warmer UK waters as species shift habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas. While some species like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle, mobile species like basking sharks and native oysters are expected to adapt well, potentially doubling their habitats. This analysis aims to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas to ensure they continue to protect species despite changing environments.</p>

Trump's abrupt exit raised questions about US commitment, while the summit produced joint statements on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and critical minerals.

          <p>Japan's exports fell 1.7% year-over-year in May, the sharpest decline since September 2024, driven by falling shipments to the U.S. and China.

The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors, contributing to a contraction in Japan's GDP.

          <p>Shares of Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company focused on traditional Chinese medicine treatments for ADHD and autism, have surged dramatically despite reporting no revenue. The stock's market value has surpassed that of established companies like Lululemon and Kraft Heinz. The company's surge is attributed to a recent stock split and increased focus on alternative medicines, though little is known about the efficacy of Regencell's treatments. The CEO controls a significant portion of the company's shares, and the company has reported net losses in recent fiscal years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the conflict between the U.S. and Iran has exposed deep divisions among his supporters. The debate over whether to intervene militarily or remain uninvolved has pitted the isolationist and hawkish wings of the Republican party against each other. Some Republicans, like Congressman Thomas Massie, are joining Democrats to block unauthorized military action, while others, including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, advocate for staying out of the conflict. This division highlights the tension between Trump's campaign promises of ending "forever wars" and his hawkish stance on Iran's nuclear program.</p>
