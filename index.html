          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fishlake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing in 1997. Investigators used the manufacturing date of the boot to link it to the cold case. White had disappeared after going fishing alone, with his boat later found empty. DNA testing confirmed the remains were a parental match to White's daughter with 99.9994% certainty. The family expressed gratitude for the closure after nearly three decades of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has levied an additional 25% tariff on goods from India, citing the country's continued importation of Russian oil. This action is part of a broader strategy to pressure nations trading with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. The executive order stated that Indian articles imported into the US will now face the heightened duty, prompting a response from India calling the move "unjustified and unreasonable." This development is part of a series of economic pressures the administration is applying to influence international trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has publicly spoken out against the possibility of a presidential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell. In a television interview, Giuffre's sister-in-law called the idea of clemency a "travesty" and a "slap in the face" to survivors. This comes as Maxwell, who is appealing her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, has reportedly offered to testify before Congress in exchange for a pardon or commutation. The family is urging for the voices of survivors to be heard over Maxwell's.</p>

The last wild Barbary lion was believed to have been killed in the 1960s, with fewer than 200 now living in captivity. While officials say reintroduction is a distant goal, they are in talks with Moroccan authorities to explore the possibility.</p>

          <p>Major League Rugby (MLR) in the United States has suffered another significant setback with the withdrawal of the Miami Sharks, reducing the league to just eight teams. This follows the exit of founding member NOLA Gold and the merger of two California teams just a week prior. The instability raises concerns for World Rugby, which has slated the men's World Cup to be hosted in the US in 2031 and has emphasized the need for a thriving domestic professional league. The future of another founding team, the Utah Warriors, also remains uncertain as it seeks new investment.</p>

          <p>Borrowers seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) are encountering significant new challenges, making it harder to access the relief program. A recent executive order by President Trump aims to limit eligibility by excluding employees of organizations involved in certain activities, though the exact scope remains unclear. Additionally, the termination of the SAVE repayment plan has created a processing backlog for over 1.5 million borrowers trying to switch to an eligible plan. A separate program, PSLF Buyback, is also experiencing severe delays, leaving tens of thousands of applicants waiting for retroactive credit toward forgiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential global economic consequences of President Trump's threatened secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia. If enacted, these tariffs could impose a 100% tax on goods from nations like China, India, and Turkey that are major buyers of Russian oil, aiming to cripple Russia's war funding. The move could lead to increased global energy prices, though some economists believe spare capacity from OPEC+ could soften the blow. The policy could also raise prices for US consumers on goods like iPhones made in India and disrupt delicate trade negotiations with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the roles of annuities and certificates of deposit (CDs) in retirement planning, noting that neither is universally superior. CDs offer simplicity, predictability, and FDIC-insured safety, making them suitable for short-term goals and capital preservation. However, their returns often fail to outpace inflation. Annuities are designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, but are more complex and less liquid. The best choice depends on an individual's specific needs, risk tolerance, and desire for lifetime income versus flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles, using a rented Penske truck as a 'Trojan Horse' to arrest immigrant laborers. According to a witness, the truck pulled up offering work, and when men gathered, masked agents emerged from the back and gave chase. The operation, which reportedly resulted in as many as 16 arrests, has revived fears of widespread immigration sweeps. The raid occurred despite a recent court order limiting agents from using racial profiling, with a top federal official warning that immigration enforcement has not stopped in Southern California.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to place Washington D.C. under direct federal control, stripping it of its local governance, in response to what he described as out-of-control youth crime. The threat followed an assault on a 19-year-old federal employee. In a social media post, Trump stated he would "federalize" the city if local authorities did not get crime under control, specifically calling for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults. Such a move would revoke the city's 1973 "home rule" status and would likely face significant legal and political challenges.</p>

The discovery of the women's bodies over several months in 2023 sparked fears of a potential serial killer in the region.

          <p>A new case before the Supreme Court, *NetChoice v. Fitch*, examines the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that requires parental consent for minors to create social media accounts. This challenges the precedent set in *Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association*, which limited the state's power to restrict ideas to which children are exposed. The case forces the Court to re-evaluate the extent of First Amendment protections for young people in the digital age. Its outcome could reveal whether the Court will further contract free speech rights for minors, following a recent decision upholding age-verification for certain websites.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's decision to incinerate over $9.7 million worth of manufactured contraceptives is projected to deny care to more than 1.4 million women and girls in five African nations. According to the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), this will lead to an estimated 174,000 unintended pregnancies and 56,000 unsafe abortions. The destruction of the supplies, many not expiring for years, is reportedly due to U.S. rules prohibiting aid to organizations involved with abortion services.
