          <p>During a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, former President Trump and various corporate leaders announced over $90 billion in new private investments for Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to leverage the state's energy resources to power a new artificial intelligence economy, with plans for new data centers and an energy innovation training hub. The event, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, was presented as a historic investment package intended to create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement was met with some protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels and AI surveillance.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th congressional district, the seat formerly held by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. A Pima County supervisor, Grijalva defeated social media activist Deja Foxx in a race that highlighted a generational divide within the party. Foxx had challenged Grijalva's 'legacy last name,' but Grijalva emphasized her own long record of public service in the community. Given the district's strong Democratic leaning, she is now the favorite to win the general election in September.</p>

          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback in 2001, has died from cancer at age 67. Murdoch was serving a life sentence and, to the end, never revealed the location of Falconio's body, denying his family the chance for closure. He was also convicted for the attempted kidnapping and assault of Falconio's girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape. Northern Territory police expressed regret that Murdoch died without providing this crucial information, and a reward for finding the remains is still active.</p>

          <p>Contractor Daniel Butierez has won the Republican primary for the special election in Arizona's 7th congressional district. The seat was left vacant by the death of longtime Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva. With the district spanning a large portion of the U.S.-Mexico border, Butierez and his primary opponents focused their campaigns heavily on border security and supporting President Trump's immigration policies. He will now face the late congressman's daughter and Democratic nominee, Adelita Grijalva, in what is considered a reliably blue district.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order establishing national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program, which allows college athletes to earn money.

The move comes as Congress debates similar legislation and follows years of pressure that led the NCAA to relax its rules in 2021, dramatically reshaping the landscape of college sports by allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and other deals.</p>

          <p>In the face of a rare backlash from his supporters over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information on the matter that she considers to be credible. His comment follows widespread criticism of Bondi after the Justice Department announced it had found no evidence of an Epstein "client list." Trump's statement appears to address calls for transparency from key allies like House Speaker Mike Johnson, while also questioning the continued public fascination with the case.</p>

          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor has officially recommended that the nation's Supreme Federal Court find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup after his 2022 election defeat. The detailed filing accuses Bolsonaro and several allies of forming a criminal association that sought to "violently overthrow the democratic order" through sustained attacks on the electoral system. These charges are linked to the January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings in Brasília by his supporters. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face a prison sentence of up to 40 years.</p>

          <p>A growing number of the world's central banks, especially in developing nations, are opting to purchase gold directly from domestic mines rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to use local currency to build reserves, support their national mining industries, and potentially acquire the metal at a discount. This trend is being driven by record-high gold prices and a broader desire among countries to strengthen their financial buffers against increasing geopolitical and economic risks.

However, he argued that since education is predominantly managed at the state and local levels, the direct impact of these federal layoffs on the daily operations of most schools, teachers, and students will likely be minimal.</p>

The extensive makeover will involve moving 1,300 plants and replacing 16,000 panes of glass.
