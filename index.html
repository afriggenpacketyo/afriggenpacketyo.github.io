        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that China has violated its trade agreement with the U.S., while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted stalled talks between the two economic giants. Trump is considering doubling the steel tariff to 50%. Federal courts ruled that Trump does not have the power to unilaterally impose some levies, presenting a roadblock to his global tariff policy, though the tariffs remain in place for now as the court considers the administration's appeal. Elon Musk is leaving his role as a "special government employee" but will remain an unofficial adviser to Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest the Trump administration may explore alternative pathways for imposing tariffs following a federal court ruling against using emergency powers to enact broad levies on trading partners. These alternative options include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Each of these options has limitations compared to the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). White House officials affirm the president's commitment to using all available tools to advance trade policies beneficial to Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Army is circulating guidelines for identifying and processing transgender troops for separation from the military, instructing personnel to address transgender troops by their sex assigned at birth and initiating medical record reviews based on criteria like grooming standard exemptions or social media conduct. Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer, criticized the policy as worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," overtly targeting transgender service members. The Army spokesperson stated that pronoun usage must reflect biological sex, and that the Army recognizes the selfless service of all who have volunteered to serve our great nation. Separated officers will receive a "Code JDK" typically used for security reasons, potentially hindering future employment requiring security clearances. </p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is suing President Trump to block his executive order aimed at cutting off federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the broadcaster over perceived political slights in news coverage. PBS argues that the order violates the Constitution's protections of speech and press freedom, and that it unlawfully interferes with the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The White House defends the order, asserting that the CPB is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.

          <p>Stephen Stanko, a South Carolina death row inmate, opted for lethal injection instead of the firing squad after concerns arose from a previous execution where the inmate may have lingered before dying. Stanko was convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her teenage daughter, as well as killing an acquaintance. South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year break due to a shortage of lethal injection drugs. Stanko's attorneys had warned him that lethal injection might feel like drowning, while the state's experts claimed the drugs render an inmate unconscious before feeling pain.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times explores the potential link between therapy culture and the increasing rate of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of “harm,” “abuse,” “neglect,” and “trauma” has led to an impossibly high standard for parenting. This cultural shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. Not only must parents provide shelter, food, safety and love, but we, their children, also expect them to get us started on successful careers and even to hold themselves accountable for our mental health and happiness well into our adult years.</p>

Overall consumer spending rose 0.2% in April from March, down from a 0.7% rise in March. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is contesting the Trump administration's claim that the state obstructs immigration law, requesting removal from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions. Gov. Gavin Newsom's office asserts that federal court rulings have rejected the argument that California law unlawfully obstructs federal immigration enforcement. The state strengthened its sanctuary policies under a law that took effect in 2018, balancing local law enforcement's role in immigration enforcement with the federal government's authority. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that sanctuary communities are endangering Americans and law enforcement to protect violent criminal illegal aliens.</p>

The president was provoked to new rage, this time by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade. Appointees of Presidents Obama, Reagan and, yes, Trump on Wednesday unanimously found that his signature tariff orders “exceed any authority granted to the President.” (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee is pressing the new U.S. pardon attorney for more details about President Trump's recent pardons, claiming the traditional system of applying for clemency has been replaced with "favors to the President's loyal followers and most generous donors." Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin asked Martin to "explain the criteria and process" he and his office have used to vet recent pardons by Mr. Trump. Typically, pardon applications are submitted by those seeking reprieve to the U.S. pardon attorney's office for a review on the merits of their case.</p>
