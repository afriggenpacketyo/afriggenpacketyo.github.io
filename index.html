          <p>A South Korean woman, Hakyung Lee, admitted to killing her two children, whose bodies were discovered in suitcases four years after their deaths.  The prosecution stated Lee administered nortriptyline, leading to their deaths, although the defense claims insanity.  The children's bodies were found in an abandoned storage locker by an Auckland family, highlighting the tragic circumstances surrounding the case.  The trial is expected to last four weeks, with the defense arguing Lee was in a depressive spiral following her husband's death.</p>

It contains sinigrin, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, which may combat inflammation and atherosclerosis.  Horseradish also possesses isothiocyanates with anti-tumor properties, potentially contributing to cancer prevention.  While more research is needed on its antifungal effects, horseradish is a versatile spice with cancer-fighting and antibacterial properties and can be used in various culinary applications.</p>

          <p>Boris Becker's new book, "Inside," details his time in a British prison and connects his early success to his later struggles.  He describes the harsh realities of prison life and contrasts it with the certainty he found on the tennis court.  Becker attributes his financial problems and subsequent imprisonment partly to his early Wimbledon victory, claiming that early fame led to poor financial management. The article also discusses his reflections on his rivalry with Andre Agassi and his relationship with his family and business associates.</p>

          <p>Russia's suspected drone attacks on Poland are seen as part of a "salami-slicing" strategy, a tactic of incremental steps to advance strategic goals without major confrontation.  Analysts cite previous instances like airspace violations and border expansions as examples of this strategy.  The drone incursion into Polish airspace prompted condemnation and increased Western defenses, but debate continues on the effectiveness of the response.  Experts warn that a weak response could embolden further Russian aggression, highlighting the need for a robust response to deter future actions.</p>
