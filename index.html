          <h2>Labour MPs Seek to Block Welfare Reform Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 22:20:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 80 Labour MPs are backing an amendment to block the government's Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits. The MPs are concerned about the bill's potential to increase poverty and its lack of adequate impact assessments on the job market and people's health. If the Speaker selects the reasoned amendment and a majority of MPs vote for it, the bill will not proceed. The level of support among Labour MPs suggests a potential rebellion against the government's welfare plans, which could lead to a parliamentary defeat if all opposition parties also oppose the bill. The government has a working majority of 165 in the Commons, meaning that 83 Labour MPs would need to oppose the bill to force a parliamentary defeat.</p>

          <p>Florida is planning to build a migrant detention center in the Everglades, referred to as 'Alligator Alcatraz,' to hold approximately 1,000 people. The facility will be built on the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, costing around $450 million annually to operate, with funding expected from FEMA. Attorney General James Uthmeier stated the location's alligators and pythons would deter escapees, while Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniela Levine Cava criticized the plan, citing potentially devastating impacts on the Everglades ecosystem. The facility is intended to aid in mass deportations of undocumented migrants, in line with President Trump's campaign pledges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' eliminating protections for 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups have criticized the decision, stating that it endangers wildlife habitats, drinking water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also dispute the claim that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk, arguing that commercial logging can exacerbate climate change and increase wildfire intensity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the chance to challenge their deportation on grounds of potential torture or death. The court lifted an injunction issued by a federal District Court judge, with the three liberal justices dissenting. Justice Sotomayor criticized the decision as a gross abuse of the Court's discretion, highlighting instances where the government wrongfully deported individuals to dangerous countries. An official from Homeland Security praised the ruling, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants warned of horrifying ramifications due to the stripping of due process protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Iran and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire, potentially ending a period of heightened conflict following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While neither Israel nor Iran has definitively confirmed the ceasefire, White House officials are touting it as a diplomatic breakthrough. The announcement followed Iranian missile attacks on a US base in Qatar, which reportedly caused no casualties or damage due to successful interception. Trump warned of a strong American response to any Iranian attacks on US interests before the ceasefire agreement.</p>
