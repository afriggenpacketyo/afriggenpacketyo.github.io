          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans following a significant net loss in fiscal year 2024. The potential closures include the Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka, which together account for about 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity. These plants have lower operating rates due to sluggish sales of the models they produce. The company has stated that the news is speculative and that they have not held talks with labor unions, parts makers or municipalities about the potential closure.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, used for weight loss and diabetes management, are being studied for potential mental health side effects. While some studies suggest a link between these drugs and mood changes like anxiety and depression, others indicate that genetic variations may play a role. Doctors emphasize the importance of considering pre-existing mental health conditions in patients and maintaining close communication with medical providers. Some patients report improved mood due to the positive effects of weight loss and stabilized blood sugar levels, highlighting the complexity of the issue.</p>

          <p>Ethics experts and former White House officials are raising concerns about Donald Trump's acceptance of overseas gifts and targeted investments, calling it "unprecedented." Incidents like Qatar offering a $400 million Boeing 747-8 to the US Department of Defense and a $2 billion investment from UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin are under scrutiny. Critics argue that these actions could compromise US foreign policy and violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution. The influx of foreign money has led to calls for stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to prevent exploitation by foreign adversaries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ambitious plan to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods, dubbed "liberation day," lasted only 40 days due to widespread panic and economic disruption. The measures, including a 10% tariff on all imports and higher rates on specific countries, triggered global stock market declines and prompted business leaders to urge reconsideration. Despite initial claims of a carefully orchestrated strategy, Trump eventually walked back much of the plan, citing concerns about economic stability and consumer sentiment. The episode highlighted the challenges and risks associated with Trump's aggressive trade policies.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between President Trump's current legislative efforts and Ronald Reagan's economic policies in 1981, dubbed "Reaganomics." Both administrations sought significant tax cuts and increased military spending through budget reconciliation, a process that bypasses the Senate filibuster. Similar to Reagan's efforts, Trump's plan aims to stimulate the economy and reduce the burden of government. The article also highlights the role of unelected officials, such as Elon Musk in the current administration and David Stockman in Reagan's, in driving these sweeping changes.</p>

          <p>This article argues that discussions about wealth should move beyond simple "rich lists" and address the issue of "extreme wealth." The gap between the wealthiest individuals and the average person has tripled since 1989, leading to concerns about the concentration of power and its impact on society. The author proposes establishing an "extreme wealth line" to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful and to guide policy interventions aimed at curbing wealth accumulation. Such a line could provide a mandate for higher taxes or compel charitable donations from the super-rich.</p>

          <p>Omololu Akinlolu, known as HoodyBaby, has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent following an incident at a London nightclub involving Chris Brown. Brown was previously charged with the same offense and remanded in custody. Akinlolu is accused of involvement in an alleged assault at the Tape nightclub in February 2023. The charges stem from an incident where music producer Abraham Diaw was reportedly attacked with a bottle. Akinlolu is scheduled to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has voiced his skepticism regarding a potential ban on the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), despite the party being classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency. Merz stated that banning political parties should be approached cautiously and that it must be proven the AfD is actively working against Germany's democratic order. The AfD, which garnered significant support in recent elections, faces scrutiny for its views on ethnicity and human dignity, but major political parties remain hesitant to form coalitions with the party.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with only the feet remaining. The theft was reported to the police, but the exact date of the incident is unclear. Locals suspect vandalism or melting down for cash, rather than political motives. The statue, which replaced a wooden version set on fire in 2020, had been criticized for its lack of aesthetic appeal. The statue was commissioned by an American artist to explore themes related to President Trump's immigration policies.</p>

This attack took place shortly after Russia and Ukraine engaged in their first direct peace talks since 2022, where they agreed to a prisoner of war swap.

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen who unintentionally crossed into South Korean waters remain stranded due to Pyongyang's refusal to communicate with Seoul. The men were picked up by a South Korean naval patrol in March after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, North Korea has not responded to South Korea's attempts to facilitate their repatriation. This situation reflects deteriorating relations between the two Koreas, with Pyongyang designating South Korea as a "hostile state."</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, which allowed them to study patterns of population history, migration and adaptation over thousands of years.</p>
