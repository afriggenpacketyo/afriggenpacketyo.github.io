          <p>Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany's international broadcaster, has named Barbara Massing as its new Director General, succeeding Peter Limbourg on October 1, 2025.

Karl Jüsten, chair of the DW Broadcasting Council, praised Massing's leadership and journalistic expertise, emphasizing her strategic foresight in a challenging media landscape.

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly reached an agreement to acquire left-back Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth for £40 million. The 21-year-old Hungary international is expected to join Liverpool after spending two seasons with Bournemouth, who have already secured Adrien Truffert from Rennes as his replacement. Kerkez's move is part of Liverpool's broader strategy to strengthen their squad, as they are also reportedly finalizing a club-record £116m deal for Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz and have signed Jeremie Frimpong. Kerkez, who previously played for AC Milan and AZ Alkmaar, had a successful season with Bournemouth, playing in all 38 league games and contributing two goals and six assists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Agresti, president of Just Facts, refutes claims that President Trump's "big beautiful bill" will cut Medicaid benefits for the poor, stating it targets illegal immigrants and fraudsters. Democrats have criticized the bill, citing CBO reports suggesting millions would lose coverage, but Republicans argue their reforms focus on work requirements and eligibility checks to preserve the program for those truly in need. Agresti argues the reforms aim to incentivize work and lift people out of poverty, while Senator Bernie Sanders claims the bill raises copayments for the poor. Agresti counters that the bill does not raise copayments for those below the poverty line and reduces the maximum copayment for others, aiming to eliminate wasteful spending.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is moving to extend the operation of two Michigan coal plants, JH Campbell and Monroe, despite opposition due to their environmental impact and high costs. The Department of Energy has ordered the JH Campbell plant to remain open beyond its planned closure date, while the Monroe plant is expected to have its closure delayed. Opponents argue that this decision lacks support in Michigan, could increase energy costs for ratepayers, and is ideologically driven, as the state's utilities did not request the extension. These plants release significant amounts of pollutants, and their coal ash ponds contaminate local water sources, conflicting with Michigan's climate law requiring 100% clean energy by 2040.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how AI is poised to automate jobs, even without achieving human-level reasoning capabilities. It challenges the notion that AI needs to perfectly replicate human thought processes to render certain professions obsolete. The author anticipates their own job being automated in the near future, as AI writing tools continue to improve. The piece argues that focusing on AI's limitations in complex reasoning tasks distracts from its immediate and practical implications for the job market, as employers are already exploring AI replacements for entry-level positions. The author concludes that AI's ability to rearrange the world, for better or worse, is independent of its capacity for simulated thinking.</p>

The attack involved tanks and drones firing on crowds gathered near a distribution center run by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Hamas-run health ministry claims that over 400 Palestinians have been killed in similar incidents since late May. The UN children's agency Unicef has criticized the GHF's food distribution system, stating that it exacerbates the humanitarian crisis due to unclear communication about site openings and locations in combat zones.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have discovered that people with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), exhibit significant differences in their blood compared to healthy individuals. The study, which analyzed data from the UK Biobank, compared 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals and found consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease. Experts believe these findings could lead to the development of a diagnostic blood test, providing biological evidence for the condition and addressing skepticism about its legitimacy. The research indicates that ME is primarily a condition affecting the blood and is not solely attributable to inactivity.</p>

          <p>According to a national security expert, a U.S. attack on Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant may not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. Joe Cirincione, a nuclear proliferation expert, notes that the exact specifications of the site's defenses are not fully known, and the 30,000-pound bombs have never been used in action. He also states that even if damage is inflicted, Iran's existing knowledge, enriched uranium, and centrifuges in other locations would allow them to quickly resume their nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency has stated that Iran has violated its non-proliferation agreements, leading to heightened tensions and potential military action.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, the Trump administration is giving Iran a two-week window for diplomacy, according to a senior official. This move is intended to allow Iran to "come to their senses" and potentially engage in negotiations, with Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in communication with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Some officials suggest this pause is necessary due to the heavy losses sustained by Iran's senior leadership and nuclear policy experts. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu views negotiating with Iran as futile, and some administration officials express skepticism about European diplomats' ability to handle Iran effectively.</p>

          <p>States across the U.S. are increasingly offering significant tax breaks to attract data centers, resulting in the forfeiture of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. These incentives, including sales tax exemptions on equipment and energy, benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. While states aim to spur economic growth, watchdog groups argue that data centers create few jobs and consume vast amounts of electricity, raising questions about the tradeoffs. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states offer data center tax exemptions, with 16 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have issued personal apologies to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020 related to the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling that ordered the metropolitan government and state to compensate Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada. The men were arrested on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The family of a third man involved, who died during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology's timing.</p>

          <p>Experts are expressing concerns that pandemic preparedness in the U.S. is deteriorating under the Trump administration, citing dismissals of independent advisors, staff cuts at health agencies, and inadequate responses to outbreaks like bird flu and measles. This decline includes reduced virus monitoring, weakened public health infrastructure, and communication issues. The H5N1 outbreak, for example, has seen limited testing and incomplete information, raising fears of undetected human infections. These factors collectively suggest that the U.S. is less equipped to handle a pandemic than it was before 2020, potentially leading to preventable suffering and deaths.</p>

          <p>The article challenges the notion that Gen Z is becoming a conservative generation, despite increased support for Donald Trump in the 2024 election. While young adults did vote for Trump at higher rates, data suggests they have not become more conservative in their ideological self-identification or their views on specific issues. The shift appears to be driven by young independent voters who are increasingly pessimistic and dissatisfied with the status quo, leading them to vote against the party in power. This generalized pessimism, rather than a genuine conservative shift, may bode better for Democrats in future elections.</p>
