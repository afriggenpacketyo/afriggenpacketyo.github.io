          <p>A 23-year-old man in the UK has been sentenced to a hybrid order of over nine years for encouraging a vulnerable woman to self-harm for his sexual gratification. This marks a watershed case, being the first prosecution for encouraging serious self-harm online under the new Online Safety Act 2023. The victim, who provided police with irrefutable audio and message evidence, described the man's actions as "calculated psychological violence." The perpetrator, who has severe autism and borderline personality disorder, will be detained in a mental health facility before serving any remaining time in prison.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian international soccer star Thomas Partey has been charged with five counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual abuse in the United Kingdom. The charges, brought forward by three women, relate to alleged incidents that occurred between 2021 and 2022. Partey, whose contract with Arsenal recently expired, is scheduled to appear in a London court in August. His lawyer stated that the 32-year-old defensive midfielder denies all charges and has cooperated fully with the police investigation.</p>

          <p>A severe thunderstorm with winds exceeding 60 mph struck central New Jersey, resulting in at least three fatalities and widespread damage. In the city of Plainfield, two individuals died when a tree fell on their car, prompting the mayor to declare a state of emergency. The storm downed over 80 trees, damaged homes, and left some structures compromised. Citing the tragedy and extensive recovery efforts needed, Plainfield's mayor announced the cancellation of the town's Fourth of July parade, concert, and fireworks display.</p>

          <p>An internal European Parliament audit suggests the now-defunct far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group may have improperly spent at least €4.3 million in EU operating funds. The investigation alleges the funds, intended for legislative work, were funneled through questionable contracts and donations to politically affiliated organizations, including some with ties to Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National and Germany's AfD. Critics argue this case highlights systemic flaws in the EU's financial oversight, which delegates budget management to political groups themselves, allowing for potential abuse.</p>

An editorial warned against the addictive nature of mystery box toys for children, causing a temporary dip in the company's stock. However, experts believe Pop Mart is insulated from major regulatory impact because its primary demographic is young adults, not minors.

While the conflict began over taxes, it was Britain's imposition of martial law on Boston via the 1774 Coercive Acts that transformed resistance into a full-scale revolution. The author contends that dispatching an occupying army to enforce laws, rather than relying on civil justice, escalated tensions and led directly to bloodshed at Lexington.

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly denied that Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly extradited from the U.S., was tortured or mistreated while in a Salvadoran prison. Ábrego García's lawyers alleged he suffered severe beatings, sleep deprivation, and malnutrition in the notorious Cecot prison. Bukele responded with photos and videos claiming to show Ábrego García looking well, though his lawyers contend these were staged. The case has drawn scrutiny to a U.S. deal to pay El Salvador to incarcerate alleged gang members.</p>

          <p>An in-depth BBC investigation reveals that an Israeli airstrike on the al-Baqa Cafeteria in Gaza City, which targeted a mid-ranking Hamas operative, resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians. The report confirms at least 26 of the deceased by name, including artists, students, children, and cafe staff who were gathered at the popular seaside spot. The strike, which killed Hamas field commander Hisham Ayman Mansour, has amplified questions about the proportionality of Israel's military actions. The Israel Defense Forces stated the incident is "under review" and that steps were taken to mitigate civilian harm.</p>

          <p>The BRICS summit of emerging economies is set to take place in Rio de Janeiro, but two key leaders, Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, will not attend in person. Putin is avoiding an ICC arrest warrant, while Xi's absence, a first for him, is officially due to a "scheduling conflict," though it may signal underlying tensions. The summit aims to strengthen Global South cooperation, but Xi's non-attendance could provide an opportunity for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a more central role in shaping the group's agenda and speaking for the developing world.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has reached the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time after a decisive 6-4 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry. After a nervous start on Court One, the 23-year-old rallied to win nine consecutive games, overpowering her opponent with strong serves and powerful shots. Kartal, who was ranked outside the top 800 just three years ago, has had an impressive run, and her performance could see her become the new British number one. She is now the fourth unseeded British woman to reach the fourth round this century.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Analysis of some 120,000 bone fragments from large animals like horses and deer suggests the ancient humans systematically smashed bones to boil and render them for their rich fatty marrow. This process would have provided a crucial source of calories and nutrients, helping to avoid protein poisoning from a diet of lean meat. The finding indicates that Neanderthals were capable of sophisticated planning, resource management, and understanding complex nutritional needs, further challenging outdated perceptions of them as unintelligent.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man has been indicted for murder in connection with the disappearance of his 27-year-old girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, in Oregon 42 years ago. Peroni was last seen in 1983 with her then-boyfriend, Mark Sanfratello, at a party before they walked into a wooded area. The case went cold until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through advanced DNA testing. This new evidence, combined with a reopened investigation, led a grand jury to indict Sanfratello, who was arrested in California and is awaiting extradition.</p>

          <p>In response to recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran has announced it is suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The move raises concerns about whether Iran will remain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty, as the attacks on safeguarded sites may lead Tehran to believe the treaty no longer provides security. This article traces the history of Iran's nuclear program, from its U.S.-backed origins in the 1950s to the 2018 U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA deal, which led Iran to resume high-level uranium enrichment.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has renewed calls to start a new political party, potentially named the "America Party," as his feud with President Trump over a major spending bill intensifies. However, experts note that creating a new national party is a daunting and expensive task, even for the world's wealthiest person. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often designed to favor the two major parties. Any attempt would likely face intense legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans, requiring a multi-year effort and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding.</p>

Observers warn that major hurdles remain, including the lack of inclusivity for local communities and armed groups in the negotiations.

Despite a previous conviction for voyeurism and a restraining order, Killick repeatedly breached the order by tweeting about Ms. Hunt.
