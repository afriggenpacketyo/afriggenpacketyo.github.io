          <h2>UK Experiences Third Major Heatwave of the Year with Temperatures Reaching 34C</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 04:06:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to peak at 34°C on Saturday, particularly in the Midlands and south Wales. Friday already saw highs of 34.7°C, prompting amber heat health alerts and wildfire warnings across parts of the country. These extreme conditions have led to hosepipe bans for over seven million people and caused disruptions at events like Wimbledon, where play was halted due to heat-related medical emergencies in the crowd. Authorities are urging public caution, highlighting risks of wildfires and drowning, while scientists link the increased frequency of such extreme weather to climate change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh national rugby team secured a significant 31-22 victory over Japan in Kobe, ending a difficult 644-day period that included an 18-match losing streak. The win, which leveled the series at 1-1, was hard-fought in hot and humid conditions, with Wales initially building a strong lead before holding off a second-half comeback from the Japanese side. Tries from Kieran Hardy, Josh Adams, and a late score from Cai Evans sealed the much-needed victory for the tourists. This win provides a morale boost for the team and its interim coaching staff before a permanent head coach is appointed.</p>

          <h2>France's National Rally Navigates Complex Relationship with Trump's US Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 04:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is cautiously managing its relationship with the Trump administration, despite ideological similarities, as it aims for victory in the 2027 presidential election. The party, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, is balancing the potential benefits of aligning with the MAGA movement against significant risks, such as negative public opinion of Trump in France and the economic impact of US tariffs. Analysts suggest the National Rally is maintaining a strategic distance to appeal to a broader, more moderate electorate and avoid alienating its base, which is also skeptical of Trump's influence. This contrasts with other European far-right parties that have more openly embraced ties with Washington.</p>

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, the home of the NBA's Clippers, by trucking in 300 tons of sand to create an indoor beach. The move was designed to elevate the sport's professional image, attract new fans, and provide a different viewing experience, free from weather elements like wind. Players and fans reacted positively, with athletes noting it made them feel like true professional sports stars and that the controlled environment led to faster, more powerful gameplay. The event represents a novel effort by the AVP to grow the sport by taking it beyond its traditional coastal venues.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to consider a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate. Prien suggested limiting the proportion to around 30-40% to improve educational outcomes, but the idea has faced strong criticism from school principals, student bodies, and education researchers. Opponents argue that such a quota would be impractical, discriminatory, and stigmatizing, and that the real issue is a lack of German language skills, not immigrant background. While some, like the German Teachers' Association, welcome the debate, the consensus leans toward providing targeted support for schools with high needs rather than implementing a divisive quota system.</p>

          <h2>Judge Allows Voice Artists' Lawsuit Against AI Firm Lovo to Proceed</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward, marking a significant development in the legal battles surrounding AI and creative rights. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege that Lovo secretly cloned their voices and sold them on its platform after hiring them for what they were told were internal or academic projects. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the AI's training data will proceed. The case is seen as a key test for holding tech companies accountable for the unauthorized use of artists' work.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Law Firms Are Expanding Globally to Meet Rising Demand from Domestic Companies</h2>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence, driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies expanding their operations overseas. These companies often prefer the trust and support of domestic legal counsel when navigating foreign markets. The number of overseas offices for Chinese law firms has grown significantly, reaching 208 in 2023, a 70% increase from 2018. While they are successfully serving their Chinese clientele abroad, lawyers note that winning over non-Chinese clients remains a challenge, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions. This expansion marks a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry on the world stage.</p>

          <h2>Cockpit Audio from Air India Crash Reveals Mystery Over Fuel Switch Activation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:59:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash that killed 260 people has deepened the mystery surrounding the disaster. Investigators found that both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff, starving the engines of fuel. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he activated the cut-off, with the other pilot denying he had done so. These switches have multiple safety features to prevent accidental activation, making their simultaneous movement highly unusual. The investigation is now focused on identifying the voices on the recording to determine what happened in the cockpit.</p>

          <p>Federal agents arrested about 200 immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The operation, which involved criminal search warrants, led to a tense standoff as protesters gathered and clashed with authorities in Camarillo. During the events, a farm worker was critically injured after falling from a greenhouse roof, and four U.S. citizens were arrested for allegedly assaulting officers. The raids are part of a larger increase in federal immigration enforcement in the region, which has prompted widespread fear in immigrant communities and led to a lawsuit and a subsequent judicial order to halt certain tactics.</p>

          <h2>China Implements Ban on Substandard Power Banks for Air Travel After In-Flight Fires</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:30:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's civil aviation authority has issued an emergency ban on passengers carrying substandard power banks on flights, following a series of incidents where the devices caught fire. The new rule, effective since June 28, bars any portable lithium-ion batteries that do not have the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. This has led to some confusion and large numbers of abandoned power banks at airports as travelers adjust to the safety precaution. The ban is part of a broader regulatory response to ensure the safety of portable charging devices, with the State Administration for Market Regulation also conducting a review of power bank products.</p>

          <h2>Northern Arizona Resident Dies from Pneumonic Plague, Health Officials Confirm</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:28:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, a rare but serious bacterial infection. This marks the first recorded death from this form of the plague in the county since 2007. While plague is treatable with modern antibiotics, the pneumonic form, which infects the lungs, is the most deadly and the most easily spread between people. The bacteria is naturally present in rodent populations and can be transmitted to humans through infected flea bites or by handling infected animals. Officials are advising residents to take precautions around wildlife to prevent exposure.</p>
