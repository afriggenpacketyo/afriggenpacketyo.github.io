          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources indicate she was dismissed under Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which outlines presidential powers. Comey was a prominent prosecutor, having led the case against Sean "Diddy" Combs and contributing to the prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father, James Comey, was terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017, and this move is seen by some as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>An undocumented street vendor in Los Angeles, identified as Marta, shares her experience of living and working in constant fear due to increased immigration enforcement. Having resided in the U.S. since 2001, she notes a significant shift in the environment for migrants, causing her to temporarily stop working and rely on her children for support. The article highlights the broader impact of immigration raids on the community, where many, like Marta, feel targeted despite having no criminal record. Her story reflects the daily anxiety and economic hardship faced by many undocumented workers in the current climate.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June, marking the second straight month of contraction and fueling fears of a potential recession. The decline was driven by a significant drop in shipments to key trading partners, including a 4.7% decrease to China and an 11.4% fall to the United States. The situation is exacerbated by the U.S. imposing a 25% tariff on Japanese imports, with no trade deal in sight. The auto sector, a cornerstone of Japan's economy, has been hit particularly hard, with exports to the U.S. plummeting by 26.7%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data obtained by CBS News on nearly 100,000 deportations under the Trump administration shows that the majority of those removed did not have violent criminal histories. While 70,583 were convicted criminals, most infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. Homicide convictions accounted for only 0.58% of cases, and sex offenses made up 1.8%, challenging the administration's narrative of focusing on the "worst of the worst." The data suggests a wide net has been cast, ensnaring many undocumented immigrants for non-violent offenses, a point of contention for some lawmakers.</p>

Experts note that such a move would challenge the independence of the central bank, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability, and would likely result in a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son who were lost in a remote California forest were successfully located by rescuers who followed a trail of notes she left behind. The pair became stranded after their vehicle's GPS led them down a series of remote roads in Stanislaus National Forest where they lost their signal. The woman's notes, along with her son's use of a whistle to signal for help, guided the search team to their location. The successful rescue was also aided by a ham radio operator who relayed the team's emergency broadcast from the dense, no-service area.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its termination of FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The lawsuit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by unilaterally shutting down the congressionally funded program, which helps communities finance projects to mitigate the impact of natural disasters. The states claim the cuts jeopardize projects that have been in development for years and leave communities more vulnerable. A CBS News analysis found that the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported President Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders has begun, seeking to hold them accountable for the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.

The plaintiffs are demanding that Zuckerberg and others reimburse Meta for over $8 billion in fines and legal costs. The trial is expected to feature testimony from Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, scrutinizing the company's privacy practices.</p>

          <p>Vital social programs that provide companionship and support to older adults living alone are at risk due to potential federal funding reductions from the president's new domestic spending bill. Programs like the Senior Companion Program in New Orleans connect volunteers with elderly residents, combating the severe health risks associated with social isolation, such as dementia and heart disease. Program directors worry that losing federal funding, which can constitute a significant portion of their budget, would force them to shut down, leaving vulnerable seniors without critical human connection and support services.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly called for the Trump administration to release all files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, stating that "the time has come" for transparency. His position stands in stark contrast to that of President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a politically motivated "hoax" run by Democrats. Pence emphasized that the names of victims should be protected but argued for releasing the facts to the American people. This public disagreement highlights a growing rift between the president and his former vice president on a high-profile issue.</p>

          <p>An NPR report challenges the Trump administration's justification for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid, finding little evidence to support claims of widespread "waste, fraud, and abuse." The administration asserts that a thorough review of USAID programs uncovered egregious spending, but former and current officials state the review was superficial and politically motivated, targeting programs with keywords like "gender" or "climate." The former USAID inspector general, who was fired by Trump, noted that the administration has not cited his office's findings and that the dismantling of the agency hinders proper oversight of funds.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the deadly June 12 Air India crash, which killed 260 people, is reportedly focusing on the captain's actions in the cockpit. According to a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the probe, a cockpit recording indicates the captain may have moved the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position shortly after takeoff. A preliminary report from Indian authorities confirmed the switches were moved but did not assign blame, noting one pilot asked the other why he had cut the fuel. The loss of fuel flow would have caused the engines to lose thrust, leading to the crash.</p>

          <p>The southern African nation of Lesotho has declared a two-year state of disaster after the threat of massive U.S. tariffs devastated its economy. Although the proposed 50% tariffs are on hold, the announcement alone caused U.S. buyers to halt orders from Lesotho's garment factories, which are central to its economy and produce clothing for major American brands. The industry is now unraveling, with factories closing and thousands of workers losing their jobs in a country of just 2 million people. The situation highlights the profound and immediate impact of U.S. trade policy on smaller, dependent economies.</p>

While the change may be welcomed by some health advocates, the Corn Refiners Association warned it could harm American farmers and cost manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>The nomination of Emil Bove, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, to a lifetime seat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is facing strong opposition. Critics, including a group of 80 former judges, argue that Bove's record of alleged bullying behavior and his deep loyalty to the president disqualify him from the federal bench. The controversy intensified after a whistleblower alleged Bove instructed Justice Department lawyers to defy court orders related to deportation cases. Despite Democratic calls for a hearing with the whistleblower, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination.</p>
