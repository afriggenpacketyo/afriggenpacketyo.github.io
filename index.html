          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has announced plans to significantly increase its capital spending on artificial intelligence, building on an existing commitment of 380 billion yuan. The company's CEO, Eddie Wu Yongming, stated the goal is to become the world's leading full-stack AI service provider, from computing power to advanced models. This move reflects surging demand for AI services and a strategic vision where artificial general intelligence (AGI) represents a new technological beginning, potentially transforming industries and solving global challenges. The increased investment aligns with similar large-scale AI spending by major US tech firms.</p>

          <p>“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” returned to the airwaves after a week-long suspension by ABC, with host Jimmy Kimmel delivering what audience members described as an emotional monologue. The show was pulled following Kimmel's comments criticizing the MAGA movement's reaction to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his return, Kimmel did not issue an apology for his remarks, and he received a warm reception with multiple standing ovations from the studio audience. The suspension and his return have drawn significant media attention amid heightened scrutiny of media companies by President Trump.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, securing the seat previously held by her late father, Raul Grijalva. Her victory over Republican nominee Daniel Butierez further reduces the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The district, which covers a large portion of the state's border with Mexico, is a Democratic stronghold, making her win widely expected. Grijalva campaigned on a platform opposing President Trump's agenda and will serve the remainder of her father's term, becoming Arizona's first Latina member of Congress.</p>

          <p>The White House has suggested that a malfunctioning escalator carrying President Trump and the first lady at the United Nations may not have been a coincidence, calling for an investigation. This followed an incident where the escalator and a teleprompter failed during Trump's visit to the UN General Assembly. A UN spokesperson, however, stated that an investigation indicated a videographer from the U.S. delegation may have inadvertently triggered the escalator's safety shutoff mechanism. The UN also noted that the White House was responsible for operating the teleprompter that malfunctioned during the president's speech.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized ABC for reinstating late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was suspended for six days over comments made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. On his Truth Social platform, Trump expressed surprise at the decision, claiming the White House had been told the show was canceled and asserting that Kimmel's audience is gone. He accused the network of broadcasting pro-Democrat content and threatened to "test ABC out on this," alluding to a previous legal settlement.

          <p>Camp Mystic, the site of a devastating flood in Texas that killed 27 girls and counselors, has announced plans to reopen a portion of the camp next summer. The owners will reopen the Cypress Lake location, which was not the part that flooded, and will implement new safety measures mandated by recent legislation championed by the victims' families. The camp also plans to build a memorial to honor those who lost their lives in the tragedy. The original camp area, which was too damaged, will remain closed as leaders work with engineers on required changes.</p>

          <p>A new theoretical paper suggests that a record-breaking high-energy neutrino detected in 2023 could be the first observational evidence of an evaporating primordial black hole. Physicists from MIT propose that the particle, which struck Earth with an energy of 220 petaelectronvolts, was produced by a burst of Hawking radiation as a small black hole exploded. This theory could also explain other high-energy neutrino events and offers a potential solution to the mystery of dark matter, assuming it is composed of such primordial black holes. While still a hypothesis, it provides a testable framework for future experiments to confirm these phenomena.</p>

The probe found that hundreds of thousands of Canadian children use the app annually despite its age restriction of 13, and that the platform collected and used sensitive personal information from them for marketing purposes. In response, TikTok stated it would introduce new measures to strengthen its platform for Canadians but also noted its disagreement with some of the investigation's findings.

The 14 plans implemented over seven decades illustrate China's complex economic trajectory and policy shifts.

          <p>Health organizations and medical experts from around the world are pushing back against the Trump administration's claim of a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Regulatory bodies including the European Medicines Agency and the UK's MHRA have reaffirmed that the medication is safe for pregnant women, stating there is no new evidence to suggest a causal link to autism. Health authorities in Australia and Spain, along with the World Health Organization, have also rejected the claim, citing robust scientific studies that contradict it and warning against the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Ryan Routh guilty on all five charges related to the attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at a golf course in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself at trial, was apprehended after a Secret Service agent spotted him with a rifle before he could fire a shot. Following the verdict, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before being subdued by U.S. marshals. He now faces a potential life sentence for the attack, which the Justice Department has framed as an assault on the democratic process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent address to the United Nations General Assembly underscored a significant shift in his relationship with the global community since he was last laughed at on the same stage. In a speech filled with grievances, he belittled climate change efforts, warned against immigration, and promoted an "America First" doctrine that prioritizes national sovereignty over international alliances. His administration's withdrawal from various UN agencies and funding cuts have forced allies to reorient their global strategies, reflecting a broader rupture in the post-World War II international order.</p>

          <p>What is being called Greece's Watergate scandal continues to unfold, with four individuals facing misdemeanor charges in court related to the marketing of Predator spyware. The software was used to target the mobile phones of high-profile figures, including government ministers, journalists, and the head of the socialist Pasok party. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's government has faced criticism for an alleged cover-up, especially since the national intelligence service, which he directly oversees, was also monitoring some of the same targets. Despite this, no government officials have been charged, and critics argue the current trial avoids addressing state involvement.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in the UK are unable to afford to move out of their parents' homes due to the rising cost of living, according to industry experts. A report from the Skipton Group suggests that nine out of ten young adults living at home would face housing and utility costs approaching half their income if they were to move out. The article highlights the story of a 21-year-old who had to move back home after her savings were depleted by rent and bills. This trend reflects a broader affordability crisis where even those with savings are struggling to cover the high costs of running a home.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Oregon believe they have located the remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," the state's oldest unidentified victim, whose dismembered body parts were found in the Willamette River in 1946. The case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence, including the remains, went missing from law enforcement custody. The discovery was made at a cemetery under a headstone marked "Unknown Woman 1946" by the state medical examiner's Human Identification Program. The remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing, offering hope that the victim's identity can finally be restored after nearly 80 years.</p>

After scoring the winning goal against Southampton, Ekitike removed his shirt in celebration, earning a second yellow card and an automatic suspension for the next Premier League game. The 22-year-old striker, who had been in excellent form, later apologized on social media for letting his emotions get the better of him. The manager expressed frustration that the unnecessary dismissal will leave the team without a key player for their upcoming match against Crystal Palace.</p>

          <p>In a parallel to the post-2020 election denialism, a number of conspiracy theories claiming the 2024 presidential election was stolen from Kamala Harris are gaining traction online. These claims, which election experts say are baseless, often rely on elaborate but flawed statistical analyses and unsubstantiated allegations of covert operations. One popular theory alleges a secret NSA audit revealed Harris as the true winner, while others point to supposed vote manipulation based on down-ballot voting patterns. Experts note the striking similarity in the flawed logic and lack of concrete evidence between these theories and those that followed the 2020 election.</p>
