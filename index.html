            <p>Cambodia is facing an existential crisis for its factories and workers due to the Trump administration's imposition of a 49% tariff rate on Cambodian goods. The American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia believes that this will not lead to reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. Manufacturers are instead considering relocating their supply chains to other countries like Egypt, India, and Indonesia. The White House claims that Cambodia's tariffs on the U.S. reach as high as 97%, a claim disputed by the country and multiple sources.</p>

            <p>China has pledged to create a 'comprehensive system' to support the employment of university graduates as the nation attempts to counter economic shocks from its intensifying trade war with the United States. The system will cover skills training, career guidance, job search and recruitment help, and support for the disadvantaged. This measure aims to provide a 'solid guarantee for high-quality and full employment' of Chinese university graduates. The announcement reiterates a decision first made in November.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has begun revoking the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. under the CBP One app, instructing them to leave the country immediately or face arrest and deportation. During the Biden administration, over 900,000 migrants entered the U.S. this way and were granted immigration parole, allowing them to work lawfully. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the status cancellations, stating it was a promise kept to secure the borders and protect national security.</p>

Salary remains a hurdle, as De Bruyne reportedly earns around £20m per year, which would likely make him the highest-paid player in MLS. MLS roster rules and designated player spots pose challenges, but there are mechanisms like targeted allocation money and general allocation money that could facilitate the move.</p>
