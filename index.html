          <p>Bitcoin's value climbed to a new all-time high above $113,000, extending its recent rally amid broader investor confidence in risk assets. The surge was amplified by significant short liquidations, where traders betting against the cryptocurrency were forced to buy back in, further driving up the price. This upward momentum, supported by institutional buying and positive regulatory developments, has also lifted other cryptocurrencies, with altcoins like Ether and Solana seeing notable gains.

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after the company reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a more stable travel market than previously anticipated. While the full-year earnings projection is lower than initial estimates from January, CEO Ed Bastian noted that booking patterns have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year. The airline beat second-quarter expectations, driven by strong demand for premium seating and its lucrative partnership with American Express, even as overall revenue per seat mile declined.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 850,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles because a faulty low-pressure fuel pump could fail, potentially causing the engine to stall while driving. The recall affects a wide range of popular 2021-2023 models, including the F-150, Bronco, Explorer, and Lincoln Navigator. According to the NHTSA filing, the failure is more likely in warm weather or with low fuel, and Ford will notify owners even though a specific remedy is not yet available.</p>

          <p>In celebration of its third anniversary, NASA has released new images from the James Webb Space Telescope showing a vibrant star-forming region in the Cat's Paw Nebula. The telescope's infrared camera pierced through gas and dust to reveal young, yellow-hued stars actively carving out their cosmic nursery, about 4,000 light-years from Earth. The detailed images also show filaments of dense dust that are on the verge of collapsing to form the next generation of stars, offering new insights into the stellar life cycle.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flooding in Texas, disaster preparedness experts are emphasizing key safety measures for flash floods, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Before a storm, families should create an evacuation plan, know their flood risk, and pack a "go bag" with essential supplies. During a flood, the primary rule is to seek higher ground immediately and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches can be enough to sweep a person away.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, financial experts advise savers to be strategic with certificates of deposit (CDs) to maximize returns. One common mistake to avoid is assuming rates will only drop after an official Fed announcement, as banks often adjust their offerings in anticipation. Savers are also cautioned against being distracted by slightly higher short-term CD rates, as longer-term CDs can lock in a favorable rate for an extended period, protecting against future declines.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. goods if the Trump administration proceeds with its plan to levy the same duty on Brazilian exports. The proposed U.S. tariff, which Trump linked in part to Brazil's prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, has set the stage for a potential trade war. President Lula stated that Brazil would utilize its "Reciprocity Law" and could appeal to the World Trade Organization, rejecting Trump's claim that the trade relationship is not reciprocal.</p>

          <p>A White House request to rescind over $1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is facing resistance from some Senate Republicans. Senators from rural states like South Dakota and Alaska are concerned that the cuts would devastate local radio and television stations, which often serve as the sole source of news and emergency alerts for their communities. Citing the recent Texas floods as an example of the need for robust warning systems, these lawmakers are seeking to amend the package to protect funding for essential rural broadcasters.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil, partly to pressure the country over the prosecution of his ally Jair Bolsonaro, is a move fraught with problems. This analysis points out that the action is diplomatically unprecedented, legally dubious since the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil, and economically harmful to American consumers who will face higher prices. The use of trade policy as a tool to interfere in a sovereign nation's justice system represents a significant and controversial shift in U.S. foreign policy.</p>
