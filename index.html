          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has supported the decision to not fly the rainbow Pride flag on the Reichstag building during upcoming celebrations. He stated that only the German national flag and the European flag should be flown on the parliament building, calling it the "right" decision. The move, initiated by Bundestag President Julia KlÃ¶ckner, has drawn criticism from opposition parties who see it as a step back from previous years' practices. Merz suggested that individuals are free to fly any flag they wish on their own property, but that the parliament building has a different standard.</p>

          <p>Amid a feud with President Trump, Elon Musk has renewed his threat to start a new political party, but faces a daunting and expensive process. Creating a nationally recognized party would require navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, many of which are designed to favor the existing two-party system. The effort would likely involve collecting millions of signatures, facing intense legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans, and costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Experts note that even for the world's wealthiest person, establishing a viable third party would be a multi-year project, making it impossible to be ready for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Seoul National University College of Medicine indicates that breast cancer survivors may have a slightly reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers analyzed data from over 70,000 survivors and found an 8% lower risk of dementia within five years of treatment, particularly for those aged 65 and older. The risk reduction was most pronounced in patients who had received radiation therapy. While these findings seem to contradict concerns about "chemo brain," a cognitive decline associated with chemotherapy, experts caution that more long-term research is needed to confirm the link and understand the underlying mechanisms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a staple of American summer holidays, has its roots in the Indigenous TaÃ­no people of the Caribbean. The term "barbecue" is derived from the TaÃ­no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames they used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century and adapted the word into "barbacoa," which was first documented in print in 1526. Over centuries, the cooking style and its associated sauces have evolved regionally across the United States, influenced by various immigrant cultures, to become the diverse culinary tradition it is today.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major policy bill advanced by Senate Republicans could significantly reduce health care access by cutting approximately $1 trillion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) over a decade. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the changes could result in nearly 12 million more uninsured people by 2034. Key provisions include imposing a work requirement for Medicaid recipients, which could cause many to lose coverage over administrative hurdles, and reducing federal funds that support rural hospitals. The legislation would also make it harder to enroll in and maintain ACA plans and could lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for many Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to restructure the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) by loosening gun regulations and cutting its budget. Officials are reportedly working on changing around 50 regulations, such as extending the validity of background checks and allowing gun dealers to destroy records after 20 years. The Department of Justice has proposed a 25% budget cut, which would eliminate over 500 investigator positions and reduce the agency's regulatory capacity by an estimated 40%. Critics, including former agency officials, warn these changes could severely hamper law enforcement's ability to trace crime guns and ensure dealer compliance.</p>

          <p>A new version of a major policy bill passed by the U.S. Senate includes enhanced incentives for the semiconductor industry, aiming to strengthen the domestic supply chain. The legislation would increase tax credits for chip manufacturers building plants in the U.S. from 25% to 35%, expanding on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. This move is part of Washington's ongoing effort to onshore advanced chip production from Asia and could benefit companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron. The bill must still pass the House, but analysts suggest the increased credits, combined with the threat of tariffs, will accelerate efforts to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity.

          <p>A recent fire and power outage that shut down London's Heathrow Airport was caused by an electrical fault that was first identified seven years ago but never repaired, a report has found. The investigation by the National Energy System Operator (Neso) revealed that the substation owner, National Grid, detected elevated moisture levels in 2018, a sign of an "imminent fault," but repeatedly deferred maintenance. The resulting power failure in March led to thousands of cancelled flights and affected over 270,000 journeys. Energy regulator Ofgem has launched an investigation into National Grid following the report, which highlights significant "missed opportunities" to prevent the failure.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from Indian fashion critics and officials over a sandal design showcased at Milan Men's Fashion Week. The design bears a striking resemblance to traditional Kolhapuri chappals, handcrafted footwear from western India that dates back to the 12th century. Following a social media outcry, a Prada executive acknowledged the inspiration from Indian footwear and stated the design may not reach the market. In response, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce is moving to patent the Kolhapuri chappal internationally to prevent future copyright infringements of the culturally significant craft.</p>

While no final decisions have been made, Santander's CEO noted the company typically uses its own brand globally, and past acquisitions like Abbey and Alliance & Leicester were absorbed.

          <p>A landmark Aboriginal-led inquiry in the Australian state of Victoria has concluded that British colonists committed genocide against the Indigenous population. The Yoorrook Justice Commission's report found that violence, disease, and other atrocities reduced the local Indigenous population by 75% in the two decades after colonization began in the 1830s. The report contains 100 recommendations to redress the harm, including potential reparations and a significant overhaul of the education and health systems to address endemic racism. The finding has been called "indisputable" by Indigenous leaders, who are urging all Victorians to accept the historical truth as a step toward reconciliation.</p>

          <p>Alexi Saenz, a leader of a Long Island-based MS-13 clique, is set to be sentenced for his role in a federal racketeering case that includes eight murders and other violent crimes. Saenz pleaded guilty to authorizing the killings, including the high-profile 2016 slayings of two high school girls that drew national attention to the gang's brutality. Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, arguing his crimes were "senseless" and "sadistic." Saenz's defense is requesting a 45-year sentence, claiming he is remorseful and was groomed by the gang as a vulnerable teenager, an assertion prosecutors dispute.</p>

          <p>The University of Pennsylvania has reached a voluntary agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to resolve a federal civil rights case concerning transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. As part of the settlement, Penn will modify school records to restore titles to female athletes who competed against Thomas and issue apologies to those "disadvantaged" by her participation. The university also agreed to adopt "biology-based" definitions of male and female for its athletic programs. The case stemmed from an investigation initiated by the Trump administration, which concluded that Penn had violated the rights of female athletes under Title IX.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's announcement of a 60-day Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed to by Israel marks a significant moment, but key details and motivations remain unclear. The primary question is whether Hamas will accept a temporary truce when it has consistently demanded a permanent one. Analysts suggest the 60-day term is a political calculation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to appease his far-right coalition partners, who oppose ending the war, while potentially pausing the conflict through the summer. The lack of specific information on troop withdrawal, prisoner releases, and other conditions means the proposal could be a restatement of Israel's existing position rather than a true breakthrough.</p>

Beijing views this aggressive price-cutting to capture market share as a threat to the economy's health, as it stifles innovation, reduces efficiency, and hinders industrial upgrading.

The settlement, which includes Trump's legal fees but no apology from the network, was reportedly pushed by Paramount's corporate leadership against the wishes of CBS News executives. Critics view the settlement as "protection money," suggesting it was motivated by Paramount's desire to ensure its pending sale to Skydance Media receives approval from federal regulators, who are led by a Trump appointee.</p>

          <p>A group of at least 180 current and former UK armed forces aircrew are seeking compensation from the Ministry of Defence (MoD), claiming their cancer diagnoses were caused by exposure to toxic fumes in military helicopters. The claims relate to service on four aircraft types, including the Sea King, which was once flown by King Charles. While the MoD has not admitted liability, it has provided out-of-court settlements to at least six individuals. A veterans' group is urging the MoD to implement a cancer screening program and raise awareness, as many more veterans may be affected and unaware of the potential risks.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: G7 Deal Exempting US Firms from Global Tax Rules Puts Corporate Profits Over People</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the G7's decision to exempt U.S. multinationals from a previously agreed-upon global minimum tax is a major setback for tax justice. The authors, including Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz, contend that the G7 caved to U.S. pressure, undermining the Pillar Two agreement designed to stop a "race to the bottom" in corporate tax rates. This move gives U.S. companies an unfair advantage, incentivizes others to relocate, and deprives countries of billions in revenue needed for public services. The authors call for the international community to reject the deal and pursue a more equitable tax system through the United Nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: As Extreme Heat Becomes the New Normal, Societies Face Urgent Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 00:51:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sweltering heatwaves currently affecting Europe, the U.S., and Asia are part of a dangerous new normal fueled by human-caused climate change. Scientists confirm that the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events have increased since the 1950s, with every fraction of a degree of warming making them worse. These events are the deadliest type of extreme weather, disproportionately affecting the vulnerable and disrupting societies by impacting health, education, labor, and infrastructure like roads and railways. Experts stress that long-term solutions require both adapting cities with green spaces and accelerating the transition away from the fossil fuels that drive global warming.</p>
