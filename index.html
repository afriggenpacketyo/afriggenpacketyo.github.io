          <p>At least two survivors from a deadly U.S. military operation against a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean are now in American custody. The strike is the sixth of its kind, part of a broader campaign to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the Trump administration accuses of facilitating illicit drug trafficking. This incident occurs amid a significant U.S. military buildup in the region and reports that the admiral overseeing these operations has unexpectedly resigned, allegedly due to reservations about the aggressive strategy being employed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with privately financed construction projects to solidify his architectural legacy, including a $250 million ballroom at the White House. The project is funded by major corporate and individual donors, prompting Democrats to introduce bills aimed at preventing donor recognition on White House structures and to probe the financing for potential conflicts of interest. Trump has also proposed a new arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial, signaling further ambitions to physically alter the landscape of the nation's capital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite escalating tariffs and political rhetoric, the economies of the United States and China remain deeply intertwined, with experts suggesting a complete decoupling would harm the U.S. more significantly. China has retaliated against U.S. tariffs with its own measures, including restricting rare-earth mineral exports and halting soybean purchases, while simultaneously redirecting its exports to other global markets like Africa and Southeast Asia. While Beijing is reducing its holdings of U.S. debt, this complex economic codependency, termed 'Chimerica,' ensures that mutual trade in key sectors like aerospace and technology remains vital for both nations.</p>

          <p>Apple has successfully acquired the exclusive U.S. broadcast rights for Formula 1 racing, commencing in 2026, through a five-year deal valued at approximately $750 million. This agreement will make all F1 sessions available to Apple TV subscribers at no additional cost, marking a significant expansion of Apple's presence in live sports broadcasting. The deal, which nearly doubles the value of F1's previous contract with ESPN, is seen as a move to capitalize on the sport's growing popularity in America, boosted by the successful "Drive to Survive" series and an Apple-produced F1 movie.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Los Angeles County have reported the first U.S. cases of a more severe mpox strain, known as clade I, that were acquired locally without any known travel history. This development is concerning because clade I has a higher fatality rate, ranging from 1% to 10%, compared to the clade II strain that caused the 2022 global outbreak. While the risk to the general public remains low, authorities are urging preventative measures, particularly vaccination with the JYNNEOS vaccine, for high-risk groups as the virus spreads primarily through close, intimate contact.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets faced significant turbulence after two U.S. regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, reported issues with bad or fraudulent loans, triggering a widespread sell-off in banking shares. The concerns over poor risk management in the U.S. banking sector rippled through European and Asian markets, with major banks like Barclays and Deutsche Bank seeing their shares decline.

          <p>In an excerpt from his upcoming memoir, "Vagabond," actor Tim Curry explores his life and career through the lens of a wanderer who has inhabited countless roles without being defined by any single one. He recounts a humorous and surreal incident at a midnight screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," where he was initially dismissed as an imposter by theater staff. Curry frames his professional life as a series of journeys, asserting that while he is still alive, it is his turn to define his own story beyond the many characters he has portrayed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has lifted domestic travel restrictions on Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, allowing him to speak at events across the country as he contests a deportation order from the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder and former Columbia University student, was arrested in March amid a crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activism. His lawyers argued that the travel limits infringed upon his First Amendment rights to speak on issues of public concern, a position the judge ultimately supported, noting Khalil is not a flight risk.</p>

          <p>In response to increased immigration enforcement by the Trump administration, volunteer groups in Chicago are actively patrolling neighborhoods to warn residents about the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. These groups, such as the People's Patrol, use tactics like whistles and community alerts to give undocumented immigrants time to seek safety and to document enforcement actions. Despite accusations of interference from federal authorities, these activists see their work as essential for protecting their communities and upholding the right to protest during a period of heightened fear.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a key European ally of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, has enthusiastically endorsed President Trump's plan to hold a U.S.-Russia peace summit in Budapest. Orbán called the planned meeting "great news for the peace-loving people of the world" and stated that preparations are underway. The choice of Hungary as a venue is notable, as Orbán's government has frequently opposed European support for Ukraine and has been accused by Kyiv of echoing Russian propaganda, creating a potentially tense diplomatic backdrop for the talks.</p>

The memory of being in the same location two decades earlier, at age seventeen while under Epstein's control, triggers a powerful emotional response, framing her long and difficult journey toward reclaiming her life and seeking justice.</p>
