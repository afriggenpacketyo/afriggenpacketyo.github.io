          <p>Prosecutors in the UK have authorized 21 charges against Andrew and Tristan Tate, including sexual assault, actual bodily harm, and human trafficking. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed the charges were authorized before an extradition warrant was issued in 2024 to bring them back from Romania, where they are also under investigation for similar charges, which they deny. The CPS stated that the Romanian criminal matters must be settled before extradition proceedings can begin. The charging decision came after the CPS received evidence from Bedfordshire Police regarding allegations made in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Jeanine Pirro, a former judge and Fox News host, as the interim U.S. attorney for D.C. Pirro's appointment follows controversy surrounding Trump's previous pick, Ed Martin, whose past defense of January 6 rioters drew criticism. Pirro, a Trump ally, has been a vocal supporter since his 2016 campaign and defended him during the "Access Hollywood" tape scandal. One of Trump's final acts in 2021 was to pardon Pirro's ex-husband, who had been convicted on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently serving prison sentences for bank fraud and tax evasion. The couple was sentenced in 2022, with Todd receiving 12 years and Julie receiving seven years. The Justice Department stated that the Chrisleys submitted false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans for luxury expenses and concealed income from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in taxes.

          <p>Germany is set to increase its weapons support for Ukraine, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz announcing increased funding for arms production and military equipment. The announcement was made during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Berlin, underscoring Germany's commitment as the U.S. appears to be stepping back from the conflict. The German Defense Ministry detailed the aid package, including cooperation in weapons construction, air-defense systems, and financing of satellite communications, valued at roughly 5 billion euros. Zelensky emphasized the need for financial support to expand Ukraine's domestic arms production, seeking $30 billion in annual financing.</p>

Judge Brian Murphy highlighted the "banal horror" of O.C.G. being wrongfully deported to Guatemala, where he was allegedly sexually assaulted and kidnapped. O.C.G. had previously been granted withholding of removal from Guatemala due to the risk of persecution, but was subsequently deported to Mexico and then Guatemala.

          <p>President Trump accused President Putin of "playing with fire" amid potential sanctions over Russia's bombing of civilian targets in Ukrainian cities. Trump claimed that Russia would have faced "really bad things" if not for him.

The exchange followed Russia's largest onslaught against Ukrainian cities in three years, prompting questions about the U.S.'s commitment to the conflict and diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable for its high proportion of shares being sold by existing shareholders rather than the company itself, a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. In Circle's updated prospectus, 60% of the shares are being sold by existing shareholders, compared to 57% in Facebook's case. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, is profitable and has significant cash reserves, but the high insider sales likely reflect venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns.

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, stated the company is working to increase the electric-only range of PHEVs. The planned expansion aligns with the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emission vehicles in the state by 2035.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent pardons of reality TV stars convicted of fraud and a sheriff who accepted bribes reflect a pattern of granting clemency to political allies and those he believes were unfairly targeted by the justice system. Trump has also pardoned individuals convicted for their roles in the January 6 riot and people convicted of fraud or public corruption. Critics argue that Trump is stretching presidential pardon power beyond its norms, while supporters claim these individuals were politically prosecuted. The appointment of Ed Martin, a staunch Trump ally, as pardon attorney signals a shift towards politically motivated pardons.</p>

Analysts note that Trump's transactional approach may keep the U.S. out of major entanglements, but also risks abandoning hotspots where it could play an influential role. His reliance on a single envoy, Steve Witkoff, for complex negotiations raises concerns about overestimating what can be delivered.</p>

The 25% tariff on imported cars to the U.S., with a potential increase to 50% for all products from the European Union, has led Porsche to scale back its forecast for the year. Unlike other European carmakers, Porsche manufactures its vehicles exclusively in Germany, making it more vulnerable to these tariffs.

          <p>Medications and supplements can expire, becoming less potent or contaminated, so it's important to check expiration dates. Pharmacist Stacia Woodcock recommends against taking expired medication, as expiration dates ensure safety and effectiveness. Expired medications can be dangerous, especially in emergencies, like asthma attacks. For safe disposal, Woodcock suggests using medication take-back locations or mixing the medication with coffee grounds or kitty litter before throwing it away. Properly storing medication in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet is also crucial.</p>

          <p>Fibre optic drones have emerged as a terrifying new weapon in the war in Ukraine, offering a way to bypass electronic warfare systems that neutralize traditional drones. These drones use a physical fibre optic cord to transmit video and control signals, making them immune to jamming. Russia has gained an edge in deploying these devices, forcing Ukrainian soldiers to adapt to this new threat. While slower and potentially prone to cable entanglement, fibre optic drones are making it deadlier to transport soldiers to and from their positions.</p>

          <p>The European Union has lifted economic sanctions on Syria, except for those based on security grounds, to facilitate the country's reconstruction. The Syrian Central Bank and other lenders can now access the European financial market. This decision follows a political agreement made by EU foreign ministers. The EU hopes this will help stabilize Syria and allow Syrian refugees to return home. Sanctions remain in place against individuals and organizations linked to the al-Assad regime.</p>

          <p>A large crowd engaged in a vandalism spree in downtown Los Angeles after an illegal rooftop concert. Hundreds of people attended the concert, which was advertised on social media, and then spilled out into the surrounding neighborhood. Vandals spray-painted businesses, Metro trains, and even an LAPD police unit. Police are working to identify suspects and track down the organizers of the underground parties, with the mayor calling for accountability.</p>
