This transaction occurs as Nvidia's market capitalization surpasses $4 trillion, briefly making it the world's most valuable company. Huang's personal net worth has surged to over $143 billion, placing him in close competition with Warren Buffett for rank among the world's wealthiest individuals. The sale is one of several by company insiders as the AI chipmaker's value continues to soar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months after the Palisades fire, small businesses along Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway are still grappling with its economic fallout. Despite being peak season, eateries and shops that survived the blaze report significantly lower customer traffic, with some seeing business down by as much as 25-33% compared to last year. The five-month closure of the highway to nonresidents isolated these businesses, and the slow return of tourism and local patrons continues to impact their recovery. Owners express cautious optimism for the future but face an ongoing struggle to remain viable after months of lost revenue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new 'Superman' film has faced preemptive criticism from some commentators for being 'superwoke,' largely due to director James Gunn's acknowledgment of the character's immigrant origins. This article argues that the backlash is overblown, as Superman's story has always been that of an immigrant, a point reinforced by his creators, who were children of Jewish immigrants. The film itself reportedly emphasizes themes of kindness and the importance of one's upbringing and choices in shaping identity. The debate highlights how cultural products can become battlegrounds in political discourse, even when their content is traditionally mainstream.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in parts of California.

Separately, President Trump authorized law enforcement to arrest anyone they believe is assaulting them during these operations, following clashes between agents and protesters.

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) held a league event inside the Intuit Dome, home of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, by trucking in 300 tons of sand to create an indoor beach. The unique setting provided players with a novel experience, making them feel like professional athletes in a premier venue, complete with a halo scoreboard and arena amenities. The indoor environment, free of wind, altered playing conditions, leading to faster, more power-driven rallies. The event represents an effort by the AVP to grow the sport by reaching new audiences in non-traditional settings.</p>

          <h2>Germany Debates Proposal for Quota on Immigrant Students in Schools</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota limiting the number of immigrant students in schools has sparked a nationwide debate. Proponents argue that a better social mix in classrooms could improve academic outcomes, while critics, including teachers' associations and student bodies, warn it would be discriminatory and impractical to implement. The debate occurs as Germany grapples with broader educational challenges, including poor performance in international studies and a shortage of teachers. Critics suggest focusing on language support and resources for schools with diverse populations rather than implementing quotas.</p>

          <p>More than 24 hours after a large-scale immigration raid in Ventura County, California, families are desperately searching for information about the roughly 200 migrants and several protesters who were arrested. Relatives report that federal agencies and consulates have provided little to no information on the whereabouts of the detained individuals. The raid targeted Glass House Farms, a cannabis cultivator, and prompted a large protest where several people, including a university professor, were also taken into custody. Community organizations and Mexican and Guatemalan consulates are being inundated with calls from concerned family members.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad found that fuel to the plane's engines was cut off just moments after takeoff. The report, from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, cites cockpit voice recordings where one pilot asks the other why the fuel was cut, which the other pilot denied doing. This action caused both engines to lose thrust, leading to the crash that killed 260 people. The investigation is ongoing, but this initial finding points to a critical and unexplained event in the cockpit during the flight's first minute.</p>

          <p>The owner of a multi-million pound penthouse on London's Park Lane has been in an eight-year legal dispute with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed and his family.

The case provides a glimpse into the combative business dealings of the Al Fayed empire.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the San Francisco Giants 8-7, extending their losing streak to seven games, their longest since 2017. Despite a late offensive surge that saw them score seven runs and chase Giants ace Logan Webb from the game, the Dodgers could not overcome an early deficit. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs in under five innings. Although the team showed signs of breaking out of its offensive slump, defensive and pitching issues ultimately led to another defeat, further shrinking their lead in the division.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece by Raja Shehadeh argues that while Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah constitutes a crime against humanity, Palestinians should not be surprised by the failure of international law to protect them. The author contends that since the 1948 Nakba, international law has consistently failed to be enforced, due to a lack of effective mechanisms and the interests of powerful nations. Hope, he suggests, lies not in legal institutions but in Palestinian resilience and 'sumoud' (steadfastness). Ultimately, he believes it will be shared humanity, not law, that will hold Israel accountable.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, part of a larger 2022 agreement. This acquisition underscores Poland's emergence as a major European military power and South Korea's growing role as a key arms supplier to U.S. allies. The deal comes as Warsaw increases its defense spending in response to Russia's war in Ukraine, which borders Poland. The new tanks will help replace Soviet-era equipment that Poland has donated to Kyiv, bolstering its defensive capabilities on NATO's eastern flank.</p>
