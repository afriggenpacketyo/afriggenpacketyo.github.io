          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over a significant military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of World War II's conclusion, and stated that the world faces a critical choice between "peace or war" and "dialogue or confrontation." The elaborate event, attended by leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, was a clear display of China's growing military capabilities and regional diplomatic pull. Concurrently, former U.S. President Donald Trump, via social media, alleged that Beijing was conspiring against the United States with Russia and North Korea. This convergence of events highlights heightened global uncertainties and evolving power dynamics, with China asserting its role on the international stage.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the second quarter, with its Gross Domestic Product expanding by 1.8% year-over-year, marking the fastest pace since September 2023. This growth surpassed Reuters' economist forecasts of 1.6% and was driven primarily by domestic spending, including household and government consumption. Despite this positive performance, analysts from Oxford Economics suggest this might be a peak, anticipating more moderate growth ahead due to cooling job markets and tapering cost-of-living support. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates and lowered its annual growth forecast to 1.7%, citing productivity concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

This victory sets the stage for a highly anticipated semi-final clash against Carlos Alcaraz, who swiftly defeated Jiri Lehecka in straight sets. The upcoming match will be a significant test for Djokovic as he pursues a record 25th Grand Slam singles title against one of tennis's new dominant forces.</p>

Marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, the event saw Xi hail the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a "heroic force." Trump's post also referenced America's significant support to China during World War II, urging recognition of U.S. contributions.

The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" qualifies as an invasion, stating there was no evidence of an "armed, organized force." This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's aggressive immigration policies, though other legal avenues for removal remain open.</p>

          <p>Major UK newspaper headlines are dominated by public "fury" following the arrest of comedy writer Graham Linehan on suspicion of inciting violence, stemming from his gender-critical social media posts. Reports detail Sir Keir Starmer's call for police to prioritize serious crime, with some outlets questioning the state of free speech in the UK. Concurrently, financial news highlights "nervy bond markets" as Britain's long-term borrowing costs have surged to their highest point since 1998. This financial pressure is prompting concerns among analysts about significant tax increases in the forthcoming UK autumn Budget, reflecting broader global economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>Thailand's acting Prime Minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, has moved to dissolve parliament following the ousting of former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and the largest opposition party backing a rival candidate. This decision by the Pheu Thai party, currently serving in a caretaker capacity, aims to trigger a new election within 45 to 60 days, pending royal approval. The move comes amidst a power vacuum and shifting alliances, with the People's Party declaring support for conservative tycoon Anutin Charnvirakul. The Shinawatra dynasty's influence appears to be waning, signaling continued political instability in the kingdom.</p>

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro blasted the decisions, calling them "politicized" and a sign that the justice system is "collapsing from within."

Demonstrators, some shouting "Gringos leave," have engaged in property damage and confrontational tactics, fueled by rising prices and a perceived loss of local culture. Experts suggest these protests, which increased after pandemic-era lulls, often arise from policy gaps and a lack of resident involvement in tourism planning. While direct confrontations can deter some travelers temporarily, the long-term effectiveness of such actions in prompting significant policy changes remains limited, perpetuating a cycle of frustration.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard soldiers and marines to Los Angeles in June was illegal, deeming it a breach of a 1878 law prohibiting the military from civilian law enforcement. President Trump had sent forces against local government wishes, describing LA as an "invaded" city amidst protests, despite observers noting the chaos was limited. The ruling is a significant setback to Trump's ambition to federalize law enforcement in Democrat-run cities and act as a national police chief.

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated his intention to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as part of his controversial push to address violent crime, declaring, "We're going in." This potential move, which could extend federal intervention beyond Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, immediately drew strong opposition from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who called Trump's comments "unhinged" and vowed to fight any deployment in court. Trump asserted his right to intervene to protect the country, dismissing Chicago's mayor as "incompetent." The situation highlights a growing federal-state clash over law enforcement authority and the use of military forces domestically.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B achieved a definitive legal victory as a jury cleared her of assault allegations in a civil lawsuit brought by former security guard Emani Ellis. Ellis had sought $24 million, claiming Cardi B physically assaulted her with a fingernail and spat on her during a private obstetrician appointment in 2018, when the rapper's first pregnancy was not publicly known. Cardi B testified that she feared Ellis would expose her pregnancy, admitting to a heated verbal altercation but vehemently denying any physical contact. The jury's swift deliberation of approximately one hour resulted in a finding of no liability for the Grammy-winning artist, concluding the high-profile case in her favor.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against the U.S. Department of Justice's most severe proposed consequences in a landmark antitrust case against Google, allowing the tech giant to retain its Chrome browser. The ruling, however, bars Google from exclusive contracts and mandates sharing search data with rivals. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta cited the rapid emergence of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, as a game-changer that reshaped the competitive landscape, stating it "changed the course of this case." This decision recognizes the intense competition in the evolving AI market, distinguishing it from Google's established dominance in traditional search. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests over the housing of asylum seekers in hotels are placing "chronic pressure" on UK police forces, according to Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council. This strain is compounded by other duties, with over 3,000 protests recorded in recent months, significantly higher than previous years. Stephens also expressed concern over political and business leaders potentially spreading misinformation on social media, exacerbating tensions. While defending the right to protest, police chiefs are advocating for better integration of refugees and a long-term strategy to reform the service, which is struggling to cope with modern challenges.</p>

While the company claims AI is doing up to 50% of the work, some analysts suggest AI is being used as a justification for layoffs stemming from pandemic-era overhiring.

          <p>The UK government is reportedly unable to accurately calculate the total cost of a secret relocation plan established after a massive data breach affecting almost 19,000 Afghans. The National Audit Office (NAO) stated the Ministry of Defence (MoD) lacks sufficient evidence for its £850 million estimate, which excludes legal and compensation claims. The breach, which occurred in 2022, exposed sensitive details of Afghans who assisted British forces, putting their lives at risk. A new Afghanistan Response Route scheme was secretly created in response, but the MoD failed to separately track its costs, leading to transparency concerns and an inability to assess true expenditure.</p>

          <p>Researchers have made a significant discovery: waxworms possess the ability to digest plastic, specifically polyethylene, and convert it into body fat within days. A study revealed that approximately 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire plastic bag in just 24 hours, a process compared to humans eating steak. While the worms cannot survive solely on plastic, scientists are optimistic about developing dietary supplements to maintain their health, potentially enabling their use as plastic-waste processors or even fish food. This breakthrough offers a promising, albeit partial, solution to the global plastic pollution crisis, which sees millions of tons of plastic accumulate annually.</p>

          <p>US filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court battle against Rochdale Borough Council in England to gain control of Hopwood Hall, a historic stately home he has spent seven years restoring. DePree claims he fulfilled the conditions of a 2017 agreement to buy the derelict 15th-century hall for £1, having invested £750,000 and secured planning permission. However, the council argues he failed to produce a "commercially viable business model" and locked him out in 2024. DePree accuses the council of "evasive, misleading and at times shocking" conduct, asserting his right to ownership and continuing his fight to save the ancestral property.</p>

          <p>A unique UK charity, the Safer Living Foundation in Nottingham, which provided support and rehabilitation for sex offenders post-release, has been forced to close due to a lack of funding. The program boasted a reoffending rate of just 2%, significantly lower than the national average of 15.1%, by addressing social isolation, shame, and guilt. Its closure, despite evidence of effectiveness in preventing further harm, highlights societal reluctance to fund such initiatives. Experts emphasize the need for more community-based prevention and therapy, contrasting the UK's approach with more proactive models in countries like Germany.</p>
