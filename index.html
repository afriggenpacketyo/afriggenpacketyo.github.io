          <p>Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), recorded an $8 billion writedown on its large-scale domestic 'gigaprojects' in 2024, despite its total assets under management growing to nearly $1 trillion. The valuation of these projects, including the futuristic city Neom, decreased by 12.4%, now comprising a smaller portion of the fund's portfolio. This financial adjustment occurs as the kingdom faces challenges from lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit. The PIF has been diversifying its funding sources, including raising public debt, as it continues to focus on domestic investments to support the Vision 2030 economic diversification plan.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows several unsuccessful rounds of talks and Trump's push to broker a peace deal, a key promise from his presidential campaign. The White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," aiming to manage expectations for an immediate ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend but will meet virtually with Trump and European leaders beforehand, emphasizing that any agreement made without Ukraine's involvement would be considered invalid.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced the state will open a second immigration jail, dubbed the “deportation depot,” at a former correctional institution in Sanderson. The facility is intended to hold up to 1,300 undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation, supplementing the controversial “Alligator Alcatraz” camp in the Everglades. This announcement comes as a federal judge considers a lawsuit from environmental groups seeking to shut down the Everglades facility due to inhumane conditions and ecological damage. DeSantis presented the new jail as a key part of his administration's efforts to support federal immigration enforcement and secure the border.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has announced plans to build over 3,000 new homes in the contentious E1 settlement area of the occupied West Bank. Smotrich stated the project is intended to permanently prevent the establishment of a contiguous Palestinian state by connecting the Maale Adumim settlement to Jerusalem. The move comes as several European countries signal their intent to recognize a State of Palestine, a development Israel strongly opposes. The E1 project has been frozen for decades due to international pressure, as settlements are widely considered illegal under international law and a major obstacle to peace.</p>

          <p>Economist Marc Sumerlin, a reported candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has publicly confirmed his interest in the position and advocated for a substantial interest rate cut. The former George W. Bush administration economist argued that a 50-basis-point reduction would be a "no-brainer" given current labor market weakness and stable inflation. Sumerlin's stance on monetary policy aligns with President Trump's frequent calls for the Fed to lower rates. While stressing the importance of the central bank's independence, Sumerlin noted that his nomination would depend on being in alignment with the president's economic vision.

          <p>In her campaign for Virginia governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is reaching out to Latino voters with her first Spanish-language radio advertisement. The ad focuses on economic issues, with Spanberger pledging to lower costs for families, a key concern for this demographic. This move reflects a broader Democratic effort to regain support among Latino voters, who showed increased backing for Republicans in the 2024 election. The ad also criticizes her opponent, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for supporting Trump administration policies. The Virginia race is often seen as an early indicator of the national political mood following a presidential election.</p>

          <p>A sudden flash flood has killed at least 37 people and injured approximately 150 in a remote village in Indian-administered Kashmir. The disaster, reportedly caused by a "cloudburst," struck the village of Chositi, where over 100 Hindu pilgrims were resting. This is the second deadly flood to hit the Himalayan region this month, highlighting the increasing frequency and severity of such events. Experts attribute the rise in floods and landslides to a combination of climate change and inadequate infrastructure planning during India's monsoon season. Rescue operations are underway, with national disaster response teams and the army dispatched to the affected area.</p>

          <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration aims to exempt commercial space launches from most environmental reviews, a move seen as a major benefit to companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. Environmental law experts argue the order may be illegal, as it directs the Department of Transportation to bypass foundational laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa). Critics warn that increased, unregulated launches could lead to significant pollution of air and water, damage sensitive habitats, and harm endangered species. The order seeks to reclassify rocket launches as minor actions not requiring review, a claim legal scholars question given their substantial environmental impact.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose by 0.9% in July, significantly higher than the 0.2% increase economists had anticipated. This was the largest monthly jump since June 2022, signaling that inflationary pressures may still be a concern for the U.S. economy. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also saw a 0.9% increase. The unexpected surge in wholesale prices could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions on interest rates, though markets still largely expect a rate cut in September. The data suggests businesses might be absorbing rising costs rather than passing them on to consumers for now. (not investment advice)</p>

However, public perception does not always align with the data, as a recent poll showed a majority of residents still view crime as a serious problem.

This trend marks a shift from nearly a decade of growth in the fast-food breakfast market.

The condition typically resolves as the rabbit's immune system fights off the infection, and it is believed to be the origin of the jackalope myth in North American folklore.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized as one of Time magazine's 'girls of the year' for inventing a solar-powered heated blanket to help homeless people. Her design, which uses solar panels to charge a battery pack that provides warmth at night, won a national engineering competition and was developed into a working prototype by the firm Thales. Thirty-five of the blankets have been distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also featured as a Lego mini-figure on a digital cover of the magazine.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that President Trump's eagerness for a trade deal with China is leading to concessions that could undermine U.S. national security interests. The article highlights a recent decision to allow American companies to sell certain advanced AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% revenue cut for the government, effectively reversing crucial export controls. This move is seen as a significant concession to Beijing, which has been lobbying for access to this technology. Critics fear that Trump's focus on securing a tangible 'win' for his political agenda could result in a lopsided agreement that benefits China's strategic goals more than the U.S.</p>

Micherre Fox, 31, found the colorless gem on the final day of a month-long search at the park, which is the only public diamond mine in the world. Two years prior, she had decided she wanted to find her own diamond for a ring, viewing the hard work as symbolic of a successful marriage. The park confirmed her find was the third-largest diamond discovered there this year, out of 366 gems found by the public.</p>

This projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase recipients saw in 2025. The annual adjustment is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation and is officially announced by the Social Security Administration in the fall after reviewing inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable this year, some economists express concern that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to tariffs.

The U.N. warns that starvation is at its highest level since the war began, with thousands of children suffering from acute malnutrition.

The mayors of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, and Oakland—all of whom are Black—have rejected Trump's premise, pointing to data showing that crime rates are falling in their cities. They criticized the president's rhetoric as politically motivated and noted the unique federal authority over D.C. that does not apply elsewhere. While asserting their local control, several mayors also called for productive federal partnership on issues like gun control and violence prevention funding.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its cuts to foreign aid, reversing a lower court's decision that had blocked the move. The ruling allows the administration to halt billions of dollars in congressionally approved funding, including nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives. Since returning to office, President Trump has moved to slash foreign assistance and largely dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Humanitarian organizations have warned that the drastic funding cuts could have deadly consequences, potentially causing millions of additional deaths by 2030.</p>

This diplomatic action is framed as a way for centrist leaders to appear proactive on the issue and vent anger from their progressive supporters, who may feel alienated by other policy shifts.

          <p>Financial experts advise that President Trump's new tax legislation, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," could complicate the decision to perform a Roth IRA conversion. While the bill makes lower income tax rates permanent, creating a potentially favorable environment for conversions, it also introduces several temporary tax breaks with income limits. Converting a large balance from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA could push an individual's income high enough to lose eligibility for these new deductions. Planners recommend a careful, multi-year analysis to balance the long-term benefits of tax-free growth against the immediate tax costs and potential loss of other tax advantages.
