          <p>The United Kingdom is set to host a meeting involving the United States, European nations, and Ukraine, signaling a renewed effort by the US to resolve the ongoing conflict. US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff will visit Moscow, marking his fourth trip since Trump took office. The meeting occurs amid reports of President Trump considering recognizing annexed Crimea as Russian territory, a proposal first discussed in Paris. Trump has threatened to withdraw from peace efforts unless rapid progress is achieved, adding pressure to the upcoming discussions. Optimism is tempered by the complexities of the situation and the potential for disagreements among the involved parties.</p>

          <p>Official figures indicate that the UK government's borrowing exceeded expectations in the year leading up to March, primarily due to increased expenditure on pay and benefits. Borrowing reached £151.9 billion, a £20.7 billion increase from the previous year and surpassing the official forecast of £137.3 billion. The Office for National Statistics attributed this rise to inflation-related costs, including higher pay and benefit increases. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is scheduled to attend IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington, where the IMF is expected to downgrade the UK's growth forecast due to global trade tariffs.</p>

          <p>Scientists have reported that coral reefs worldwide are experiencing the most severe bleaching event on record, affecting 84% of reefs. This crisis, the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, surpasses the intensity of the 2014-17 episode. Coral bleaching occurs when warming waters cause algae within corals to produce toxins, leading to their expulsion and increased risk of disease and starvation. Scientists emphasize that addressing climate change by reducing emissions from fossil fuels is the most effective way to protect coral reefs, as the current crisis is driven by rising ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced he will significantly reduce his involvement in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) initiative after Tesla reported a substantial drop in profits and revenues. The decline is attributed to slumping sales and a consumer backlash against Musk's prominent political role. Tesla's automotive revenue fell by 20% and profits plummeted by over 70% in the first quarter of 2025, leading to investor concerns. Musk's political activities, including substantial contributions to Trump's re-election campaign, have drawn criticism and boycotts, prompting his decision to refocus on Tesla.</p>
