          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis during morning drop-off resulted in two fatalities and over a dozen injuries, with the suspected shooter believed to be deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. City officials confirmed the threat was contained, assuring the community of no active danger. The incident deeply impacted the school, serving students from pre-K to eighth grade, as families anxiously awaited news and young children were seen evacuating. Residents living nearby reported hearing dozens of gunshots, highlighting the sudden and violent nature of the event. Governor Tim Walz and President Donald Trump expressed profound sorrow, as state and federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, responded to investigate this horrific act of violence that marred the first week of school.</p>

          <p>This article explains that tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of a product's value, which companies pay to the government and may pass on to consumers. President Donald Trump has implemented widespread tariffs, arguing they boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit, particularly targeting countries with political grievances or those not agreeing to favorable trade deals. His policy has introduced global economic volatility, leading some firms to increase prices for US consumers. The article details specific tariffs on goods like steel and cars, and against countries like India and Brazil, while noting ongoing legal challenges to Trump's authority and negotiations with allies like the UK and EU.

          <p>Polish President Karol Nawrocki vetoed a government bill to extend social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees until March 2026, arguing that benefits should only go to those employed in Poland and prioritizing Polish citizens in healthcare. This decision puts Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government in a difficult position, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands of refugees without legal status. Nawrocki, who also proposed tightening naturalization requirements and banning symbols of Ukrainian nationalist groups, stated that public opinion and financial situations have changed. Critics view this as an anti-Ukrainian stance, despite the significant economic contributions of Ukrainian refugees to Poland's GDP and the potential risk to Starlink funding for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Trump White House, through top economic adviser Kevin Hassett, publicly urged Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to take a leave of absence, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. This pressure comes as Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, plans to file a lawsuit challenging her removal by President Trump, which her attorney asserts lacks any factual or legal basis. Hassett defended Trump's constitutional ability to remove a Fed governor "for cause," setting the stage for a significant legal and political confrontation. This escalating battle could potentially reach the Supreme Court, highlighting a notable clash between the executive branch and the independent central bank over its personnel.</p>

After being returned to the US in June, he faced human smuggling charges, which his lawyers deem "preposterous," and was subsequently taken into ICE custody with new plans for deportation to Uganda. His legal team quickly filed a lawsuit, alleging the government is retaliating against him for exercising his constitutional rights, underscoring the complex and contentious nature of his immigration battle.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in the House are actively pursuing legislative pathways to extend federal control over Washington D.C.'s police force, aiming to solidify the White House's ongoing crime crackdown. Current law allows the president to federalize D.C. police for a limited period, but new bills propose removing or significantly extending these timeframes. Supporters, including Rep. Andy Ogles, argue this is crucial for public safety, pointing to a reported decrease in homicides since federal intervention began. Conversely, opponents, mainly Democrats, view these efforts as an unacceptable erosion of the nation's capital's autonomy, igniting a significant debate over the balance of local governance and federal oversight in addressing urban crime.</p>

          <h2>CBS News Analysis Shows Decline in D.C. Violent Crime Amid Federal Deployments</h2>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of D.C. crime data reveals a nearly 50% reduction in violent crime during the nearly three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement agents to Washington. Burglaries and car thefts also saw significant drops, although local police data indicated a downward trend before the federal intervention. The analysis found that federal forces were primarily deployed in high-crime areas, with a concentration of overall crime incidents nearly three times higher than the citywide average near deployment locations. However, some local leaders, like D.C. Council member Brianne Nadeau, argue the deployments are scaring residents and businesses. The White House reports over 1,000 arrests and 115 firearms seized, while Trump continues to assert that D.C. crime data is "phony."</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it will reclaim full management control of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, a major transit hub, from various lease agreements. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated this move is necessary to "help make this city safe and beautiful," aligning with the Trump administration's broader anti-crime crackdown in Washington. Union Station has been a focal point of this federal intervention, with a significant National Guard presence and visits from high-ranking officials. This article highlights that the DOT aims to reinvest income from the station, such as parking revenue, directly into capital improvements like security, lighting, and elevators, expecting renewed control by September to enhance the station's condition and public safety.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency review into the 2024 Ammanford school stabbing, where a 13-year-old girl attacked two teachers and a pupil, found the perpetrator was fascinated by weapons and war, and had previously been found with a knife and BB gun. The girl, who was sentenced to 15 years for attempted murder, was described as "quirky" with "unusual interests" in Hitler and pretending to speak German and Russian. The report concluded that she would have benefited from "targeted help" if information had been fully shared and assessed, highlighting missed opportunities and declined support offers from her father. This article underscores the critical need for better inter-agency information sharing and sufficient resources to address the increasing complexity and mental health needs of children and young people in schools.</p>

          <p>A key indicator of commercial real estate activity, JLL's global Bid Intensity Index, improved in July for the first time this year, signaling a potential rebound after a period of uncertainty. The index, which measures bidding activity and competitiveness, shows stabilizing "bidder dynamics" and narrowing bid-ask spreads across multiple sectors, particularly in multifamily apartments. While industrial and retail sectors face challenges from tariffs and supply chain issues, the office market is also showing improvement, with more bidders and lenders. This article suggests investors are increasingly accepting uncertainty as the new normal and moving into a "risk-on" mode, expecting gradual momentum through the second half of the year.

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, reportedly canceled parts of his Lebanon visit following widespread criticism for his "insulting remarks" to Lebanese journalists. Barrack, a longtime friend and fundraiser for President Trump, urged reporters to "act civilized" rather than "animalistic" during a news conference in Beirut, sparking condemnation from the Union of Journalists in Lebanon, who called for an apology and a boycott of his activities. The Lebanese Presidency also expressed regret for the "inadvertently made" statements from its platform. This article highlights a significant diplomatic misstep and the resulting backlash over perceived dehumanizing comments and a lack of diplomatic etiquette, leading to protests against his expected presence.</p>

          <p>A debate has erupted in Germany after a right-wing extremist, now identifying as Marla-Svenja Liebich, legally registered as a woman shortly after being sentenced to prison, prompting suspicions of abusing the new Self-Determination Act for better prison conditions. Liebich, a former neo-Nazi leader convicted of incitement to racial hatred, is now slated for a women's prison. Conservative politicians, including Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, are calling to reevaluate the law, arguing it's too easy to change legal gender. Progressive activists, however, condemn these calls as populist, asserting the law is crucial for the human rights of trans and non-binary individuals and should not be undermined by an individual case.</p>
