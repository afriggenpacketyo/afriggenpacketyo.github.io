          <p>Elmer Wayne Henley Jr., now 69, is speaking out about his role as an accomplice to Houston serial killer Dean Corll in a new true-crime documentary. Recruited as a teenager, Henley helped lure young boys who were then tortured and killed, a reign of terror that ended when Henley fatally shot Corll in 1973. A forensic psychologist interviewed for the film suggests Henley, who was coerced after the first murder, suffers from PTSD and is remorseful, viewing him as both a victim and a perpetrator in the horrific crimes that claimed at least 28 lives. The article notes Corll also subjected his victims to sexual assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid reports that the U.S. may press Ukraine to surrender the Donbas region for peace, the potential impact of such a concession is being heavily debated. The regions of Donetsk and Luhansk are rich in resources and hold deep cultural and historical significance for Ukrainian identity, with many residents having fled the Russian occupation. While some Ukrainians living near the front lines express a desperate desire for peace, even at the cost of territory, national polls show strong opposition to ceding land. Ukrainian officials maintain that any such deal would be a betrayal and constitutionally problematic, emphasizing the need for robust security guarantees.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel has denied that his recent comment about “entertainers and competitors” was aimed at his teammate, Shedeur Sanders. During a preseason game, Gabriel stated his job is to compete, not entertain, which led to social media speculation that he was taking a jab at the high-profile Sanders. Gabriel later clarified his remarks, stating he was referring to the media as entertainers and himself and his teammates as competitors who are focused on their jobs. The two quarterbacks, both selected in this year's draft, are competing for position on the team's depth chart.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has postponed its plan to resume operations after its 10,000 striking flight attendants defied a government back-to-work order and remained on picket lines. The strike, which began Saturday, has already stranded over 100,000 travelers and led to hundreds of flight cancellations. The Canadian Union of Public Employees stated that demonstrations will continue, urging the airline to negotiate a fair contract rather than relying on federal intervention. Key issues in the dispute include pay and compensation for unpaid work performed when planes are on the ground, with the union rejecting the airline's latest offer as insufficient.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's continued rejection of a ceasefire is complicating peace efforts ahead of his visit to the White House. This follows a U.S.-Russia summit where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region in exchange for an end to hostilities, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected without robust security guarantees. Zelenskyy emphasized that stopping the violence is a crucial first step for any meaningful negotiations and that he would continue coordinating with European partners. Meanwhile, Russia launched dozens of drones into Ukraine overnight, underscoring the ongoing intensity of the conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that ending the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Kyiv and Moscow. Speaking ahead of a White House meeting between the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents, Rubio stated that a peace deal cannot be achieved if one side gets everything it wants, as that would be equivalent to surrender. While he did not specify what concessions would be needed, he mentioned that security guarantees for Ukraine and the demarcation of territorial lines are key areas for negotiation. His comments suggest a diplomatic path focused on compromise, following recent direct talks between the U.S. and Russia.</p>

          <p>A new study on dental remains discovered at China's Hualongdong archaeological site suggests a more complex history of human evolution in Asia than previously understood. The 300,000-year-old teeth exhibit a unique mosaic of archaic features, similar to Homo erectus, and more modern traits found in Homo sapiens. This combination implies that different evolutionary traits may have developed at varying speeds and that interbreeding with other hominin species occurred. The findings challenge linear models of human evolution and indicate that modern human characteristics may have emerged in Asia much earlier than previously thought, prompting further research.</p>

          <h2>Nationwide Protests in Israel Demand Ceasefire and Hostage Release from Gaza</h2>

          <p>Protesters across Israel conducted a nationwide strike, blocking major roads and closing businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations, organized by families of hostages, mark an escalation in public pressure on the government after 22 months of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other right-wing cabinet members criticized the protests, claiming they benefit Hamas and delay the hostages' release. The action comes amid fears that a planned new military offensive could further endanger the approximately 50 hostages still held in the territory.</p>

          <h2>VAR Disallows Crystal Palace Goal Due to Attacking Player's Proximity to Wall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:06:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed by VAR due to a lesser-known rule regarding player positioning. The decision was made because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to IFAB's Law 13, introduced in 2019, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a wall formed by three or more defenders. The rule was implemented to prevent management issues and time-wasting, leading to the correct, though surprising, reversal of the goal.</p>

          <p>Award-winning Irish novelist Sally Rooney has declared her intention to continue supporting the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, even after it was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. Rooney stated she will use her earnings and public platform to support the group's direct action campaigns, saying, "if this makes me a supporter of terror under UK law, so be it." Her statement comes as the UK Home Secretary defended the ban, citing the group's activities targeting arms companies and a manual providing guidance on how to conduct attacks and evade law enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Recent Downfall of Ethnic Minority Officials Signals Shift in China's Political Discipline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent corruption investigations into several senior officials from China's ethnic minority communities signal a significant policy shift under President Xi Jinping. Historically, high-ranking positions in autonomous regions were often held by officials from local ethnic groups as a measure of inclusion, and they were rarely targeted in anti-graft campaigns. However, the recent cases suggest that this ethnicity-based leniency is ending, as the Communist Party intensifies its push for political discipline and loyalty across all levels of government, regardless of an official's background. This reflects a broader move towards stricter, more uniform governance.</p>

          <h2>July's Higher-Than-Expected Inflation Data Raises Concerns Among Economists</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic data showing a hotter-than-expected rise in both producer and consumer prices for July is causing concern among some economists, even as markets remain hopeful for an interest rate cut. The surge, driven largely by services inflation, complicates the Federal Reserve's position as it balances price stability with a potentially softening labor market. While investors are still betting on a September rate cut, some economists argue that broad-based inflationary pressures from wages and energy costs suggest the Fed should consider holding rates steady or even raising them.

          <p>The recent U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska is being analyzed as a strategic win for Vladimir Putin, who conceded little while gaining diplomatic standing. The U.S. president failed to secure his primary goal of a ceasefire, instead shifting to align with Russia's preference for a comprehensive peace deal first. This outcome, combined with the U.S. halt on direct weapons deliveries, places Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies in a more precarious position. They now face increased pressure and distrust, while Russia can continue its military campaign without facing new immediate consequences from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Evie Parts, a transgender long-distance runner, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Swarthmore College, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team due to her gender identity. The lawsuit argues that the NCAA, as a private organization, cannot override federal and state anti-discrimination laws like Title IX. Parts was removed from the team on the same day the NCAA implemented a new policy restricting transgender athletes in women's sports. The complaint details the severe emotional distress Parts suffered, and her attorney called the NCAA's policy "bigoted" and criticized the college for choosing to enforce it.</p>
