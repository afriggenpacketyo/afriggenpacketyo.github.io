          <p>A specialized diver died during the operation to recover the superyacht 'Bayesian' that sank off Sicily in 2024, leading to the suspension of the recovery efforts. The yacht sank after being struck by a storm, killing British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and six others. The diver was part of a team working to cut and remove the mast before recovering the yacht from the seabed. Investigations are underway into the diver's death, and the recovery work, which was expected to take 25 days, has been halted pending the investigation's outcome.</p>

          <p>Leaders from France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland, in a united front in Kyiv, urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, starting Monday. The leaders, supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, threatened to escalate sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin refuses. The proposal comes amidst ongoing efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the three-year conflict, with building up Ukraine's military capabilities being a key deterrent against Russia. The ceasefire would halt fighting on land, sea, and in the air, with the U.S. taking the lead in monitoring the truce.</p>

Miran also highlighted the administration's focus on deregulation to encourage domestic production and competitiveness, while refuting claims that tariffs will inevitably raise costs for consumers, suggesting businesses will adapt supply chains.</p>
