        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Zelenskyy has accused Vladimir Putin of insincerity in peace talks, pointing to escalating Russian drone and missile attacks. Zelenskyy appealed to the U.S. and Europe to impose stronger sanctions on Russia to compel them to cease fire and engage in respectful negotiations. He framed Putin as the primary obstacle to a peace agreement, especially given the backdrop of stalled U.S.-brokered talks and rising tensions. The Ukrainian president seeks a 30-day ceasefire for meaningful discussions, a proposal Russia has continually rejected, while Russia continues to develop its memorandum setting out its negotiating position, and it expects Ukraine to do the same.</p>

          <p>A new Greenpeace report, verified by The New York Times, reveals Russia is constructing power lines in occupied Ukraine to connect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its grid, indicating plans to restart the facility. The construction includes over 50 miles of electricity lines and pylons between Mariupol and Berdyansk. Experts warn against restarting the plant due to safety concerns and ongoing fighting, while Ukrainian officials fear unpredictable consequences. This move contradicts efforts to discuss the plant's fate in peace talks and signals Russia's intent to harness the plant for its energy needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist argues that the widening political gap between young men and women is rooted in economic shifts over the past half-century. The decline of manufacturing and the rise of the cognitive economy have disproportionately affected men, leading to job insecurity and regressive gender norms. Women, empowered by feminist messages and evolving social roles, have adapted more successfully to the changing landscape, leaving men feeling a crisis of masculinity. The author suggests redefining men's role in an inclusive way that embraces caretaking and production, rather than relying on a resurgence of manufacturing.</p>

However, analysts expect growth in India's iPhone shipments to plateau due to limited manufacturing capacity. Analysts also suggest that protectionist measures from both Washington and Beijing could curb India's ability to expand its iPhone capacity, as President Trump has threatened tariffs on all iPhone shipments not manufactured domestically (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>UK food inflation has risen to its highest level in a year, driven primarily by increased beef and fresh produce prices, according to the British Retail Consortium. Food prices increased 2.8% in the year to May, up from 2.6% in April, as retailers pass on the costs of higher minimum wages and increased employer National Insurance contributions. The British Meat Processors Association reports that beef prices have risen to record levels due to strong demand and lower supply. The industry is struggling to keep up with demand, while government schemes have focused on environmental initiatives rather than production support.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has warned that Donald Trump's policies and actions bear a striking resemblance to those of far-right regimes in the 1930s. In his new book, Dalio argues that Trump is expanding executive power and bypassing other branches of government. He expresses concern about Trump's attempts to eliminate opposition, control the media, and disregard court orders. Dalio also highlights the growing national debt as a serious problem and criticizes the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the 2024 election by Catalist, a Democratic data firm, reveals key insights into the Democratic Party's performance. Democrats did not lose due to weak progressive turnout; swing voters played a crucial role. Young voters shifted right, particularly young men. Nonwhite voters, especially young men, also moved towards the Republican Party. These trends challenge the Democratic Party's long-held belief that demographic shifts would guarantee future electoral success.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged the policy has pushed people into poverty but warned that removing it would "cost a lot of money". The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy, with the taskforce looking at the cap and nothing is off the table.</p>
