          <p>Three men, who had been granted temporary leave to remain in the UK after claiming asylum, have been charged under the National Security Act for allegedly targeting journalists working for Iran International, a London-based media organization critical of the Iranian regime. The men are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service, specifically Iran, in carrying out UK-related activities, with one of the men also charged with intending to commit serious violence against a person in the UK. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that Iran must be held accountable for its actions and emphasized the need to strengthen national security powers. The defendants have been remanded in custody and are scheduled to appear at the Old Bailey on June 6th.</p>

          <p>A series of music festivals planned for Brockwell Park in south London are at risk of cancellation after a resident won a High Court challenge, arguing that Lambeth Council did not have the correct planning permission for the events. The judge found that the council granted use of the park for nine days more than allowed without additional planning consent. The Night Time Industries Association warned that cancelling the festivals would be a "devastating blow" to the local economy and impact thousands of people who rely on the summer season for their livelihoods. The council is currently assessing the impact of the judgment and determining next steps, while organizers are considering their legal options.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years in a reciprocal arrangement. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia. The EU has reportedly been pushing for stays as long as four years, while the UK is considering a shorter duration. Universities and students have noted that Brexit has made studying in the UK less attractive, as EU students now generally have to pay international fees. The first talks since Brexit will include discussions on fishing rights.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have made advances in plasma excitation technology that can significantly enhance the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones, according to a new study. Wind tunnel tests showed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could boost an aircraft wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 percent, a metric indicating superior flight efficiency. This technology could potentially extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones. The research was conducted by a team at the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics under the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC).</p>

          <p>During a tour of the Middle East, President Trump announced multibillion-dollar tech deals with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. These agreements involve the sale of advanced U.S. technology and concentrate power in the hands of a few tech CEOs. The deals, negotiated face-to-face with Gulf country leaders, break with the Biden administration's strict controls on selling cutting-edge tech to Middle Eastern powers due to their links with China. Elon Musk's presence on the trip highlighted his influence, as Starlink inked an agreement for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) released a report detailing how the white nationalist hate group Patriot Front is using combat sport clubs, known as Active Clubs, to recruit new members. These clubs, which train in mixed martial arts, serve as smaller networks where members bond over white nationalist ideologies. The SPLC report's author Jeff Tischauser said that the Active Clubs maintain a robust online presence to encourage young men to become radicalized and that Patriot Front is using these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile to evade researchers and law enforcement. Since 2023, there has been a 14% increase in hate groups, according to the SPLC.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and avid runner, experienced years of worsening calf pain before finally being diagnosed with Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES), a rare condition where the popliteal artery is compressed by muscles and tendons. After an initial bypass surgery failed, Prindle found a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic who performed a surgery to remove portions of her gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles. The surgeries corrected Prindle's legs and have allowed her to return to a semblance of a normal life. Prindle hopes her story inspires others to push for answers when they know something is wrong.</p>

          <p>Manvir Singh's new book, "Shamanism: The Timeless Religion," explores the widespread phenomenon of shamanism, defining a shaman as a specialist who engages with unseen realities through non-ordinary states to provide services like healing and divination. The shaman's journey is archetypal, involving encounters with demons, sky flights, and underworld plunges, ultimately returning with new capabilities. The author argues that shamanism is a "compelling technology for dealing with uncertainty," interceding on our behalf in the face of chaos. The connection between shamanism and conspiracy theory is explored, highlighting the belief in another order of reality populated with entities, where the shaman possesses the power to change the weather or reverse curses.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is under scrutiny for appointing officials with views on vaccines that run counter to scientific evidence, raising concerns about the future of immunization policy. Unlike Robert F. Kennedy Jr., these appointees, including Marty Makary, Tracy Beth Høeg, Vinay Prasad, and Jay Bhattacharya, hold advanced degrees and have published scientific papers, lending a sheen of legitimacy to their skepticism. While they have acknowledged the lifesaving powers of immunization, they have also questioned the safety and usefulness of some vaccines, particularly COVID-19 vaccines, and have been criticized for ignoring evidence that does not support their views. Their stances could erode confidence in public health and lead to unnecessary testing, producing misleading data.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is facing increased competition from other locations offering financial incentives, leading to a decline in film and TV production in the area.

States within the U.S. are also competing for production business, with New York and New Jersey increasing their production incentives. The situation is dire, with concerns that California could lose its status as the entertainment capital of the world if action is not taken.</p>

The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people, including royalty, had personal rights and that even kings had to abide by laws. The rediscovered document is dated to the final iteration of the Magna Carta in 1300, and is one of only 24 original documents that survive today.</p>

          <p>A tornado tore through St. Louis, Missouri, resulting in at least five deaths and damage to more than 5,000 buildings. The tornado swept along a major road, tearing roofs off houses, uprooting trees, and knocking down power lines. Approximately 100,000 properties were left without power, and the fire department conducted house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas. The US National Weather Service reported at least six other tornadoes in Missouri and neighboring Illinois, with more severe weather conditions stretching eastwards to the Atlantic coast.</p>

          <p>Japanese automakers are focusing on strong sales of fuel-efficient models and potential price increases to offset the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars. Toyota and Honda project significant profit declines due to the 25% tariff that took effect on April 3. While raising prices could ease the pressure on profitability, the strategy risks driving away customers. Toyota will focus on local development and production in the medium and long term, and consider redirecting vehicles to other markets in the short term. These tariffs are another blow to Nissan, which has been undergoing massive restructuring due to faltering sales in the U.S. and China markets.</p>

          <p>An "Alternative Device Fair" in Westport, Connecticut, showcased intentionally limited-functionality phones for families concerned about the impact of smartphones and social media, particularly on children. The devices, mostly generic-looking smartphones, offer restricted app stores and advanced parental-control features, blocking social media access. The event reflected a broader concern about social media's effects on children and teenagers, and a desire to push back against the trend of giving iPhones as elementary-school graduation presents. The options on display balanced the benefits of connectivity with protection from harmful content, such as violent videos, messages from creeps, and the urge to endlessly scroll.</p>

Dowd writes that Biden's essence is a chip on his shoulder and that he trusted only his family and his closest aides, who protected him with a damaging chimera. She argues that the nadir was Biden's cascade of caesurae at the debate, and that the Democratic party took too long to acknowledge and push back against what Americans could see with their own eyes.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that long-term care costs, which can easily exceed $100,000, are a significant financial burden that many Americans are unprepared to manage. Over half of Americans turning 65 today will require long-term care due to disabilities, with the average future cost estimated at $122,400. Many types of insurance often don't cover these costs, and Medicaid eligibility requires individuals to exhaust a significant portion of their assets. Financial advisors recommend proactive planning, including discussing long-term care needs with family members and considering hybrid insurance policies that combine life insurance with long-term care benefits.</p>
