        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and substantially enlarge Alcatraz prison to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Trump stated that the reopening of Alcatraz would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," citing concerns about repeat criminal offenders. Alcatraz, originally a naval defense fort, was later a military prison before becoming a federal prison, housing notorious gangsters like Al Capone. The prison closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, being nearly three times more expensive than other federal prisons because of its island location.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing a national security threat and a concerted effort by other nations. He authorized the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of taxing movies produced in foreign lands, claiming it's a matter of messaging and propaganda, and emphasizing a desire to bring movie production back to America. This move comes amid concerns about the loss of jobs for middle-class film workers in the US due to foreign tax incentives and lower labor costs, although some argue that the cost of shipping props and people overseas can negate these savings.</p>

          <p>Two people were killed when a small plane crashed into two homes in Simi Valley, California. The aircraft, a Vans RV-10, had taken off from William J.

The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, examining factors such as weather conditions, pilot experience, and potential mechanical failures.

The study, published in Nature Plants, analyzed domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of Rosa likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world and have been regarded as a symbol of love and beauty from antiquity to modern times.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Battle of Berlin, the city still carries visible scars from World War II, including bullet-riddled facades and gaps in rows of houses. The battle in late April and early May 1945 reduced much of the city to rubble, but infrastructure was quickly repaired, and life gradually returned. While parts of the city were ruined, schools and essential services resumed, marking the end of Hitler's reign and the beginning of a divided Berlin, later reunited in 1990.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly catching up to the United States in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, challenging the long-held belief that America is always ahead. While the U.S. has largely developed proprietary AI models and charged for access, Chinese firms have expanded their influence by freely distributing their models for public use, making them more accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. With Chinese apps like TikTok and Temu gaining global popularity, the article suggests that the world may soon be relying on Chinese AI technology, unless the United States takes steps to openly share more of its AI technologies and research and innovate faster.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has taken a more assertive stance on India amid rising tensions following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir. General Munir has shaped Pakistan’s tone with tough rhetoric, warning against any Indian military misadventure and emphasizing Kashmir's importance to Pakistan's national identity. Analysts suggest this reflects a need to project strength and rally public support amid political divisions and economic hardship, as well as his personal hard-line views on India shaped by his time leading military intelligence agencies.</p>

Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.

          <p>The end of a U.S. tax loophole is forcing apparel makers in Guangzhou, China, to consider alternative markets or cheaper locations due to tariffs and President Trump’s new tax on cheap imports. Factory managers are struggling with tight profit margins and declining orders, leading some to relocate to provinces with lower wages or consider moving to countries like Vietnam. With exports being a major driver of China’s economic growth, the trade tensions are creating significant challenges for businesses in Guangzhou, with many facing a tipping point.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's chancellor at a time when the country faces deep divisions and economic challenges. Known for his conservative views and divisive tactics, Merz's approach to politics has raised concerns about his ability to unify the nation. With the anti-Europe, pro-Russia Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party gaining traction, Germany needs a leader who can rally the country with vision and purpose, but Merz's track record suggests he may deepen divisions rather than bridge them.</p>

Widakuswara argues that the Trump administration, through the actions of the defendants, USAGM, and the government’s special adviser Kari Lake, are attempting to unlawfully dismantle VOA’s operations because they deem it contrary to the government’s agenda.</p>

          <p>As high tariffs decimate U.S. orders for Chinese goods, China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market, a move that threatens to drive the world's second-largest economy into deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting efforts to redirect products to Chinese consumers, leading to a fierce price war among Chinese firms. An influx of discounted goods would erode profitability, weigh on employment, and contribute to weak consumer demand, deepening deflation in China's wholesale prices.</p>
