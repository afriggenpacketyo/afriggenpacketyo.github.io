        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alex Soros, son of George Soros, faced backlash for condemning the killing of two Israeli embassy staffers while his Open Society Foundation funds groups critical of Israel. Critics argue Soros's funding fuels anti-Jewish sentiments by supporting organizations that accuse Israel of genocide and seek its end as a Jewish state. Israel's diaspora affairs minister stated that Soros mirrors his father's anti-Israel agenda, funding groups like Human Rights Watch and J Street, which are perceived as delegitimizing Israel. The elder Soros has also been criticized for donating to organizations allegedly supporting Hamas, further fueling the controversy. </p>

          <p>The skincare industry is under scrutiny for marketing products with anti-aging ingredients to tweens, some of which can harm young skin. Many TikTok videos feature teens using products with retinoids and vitamin C, which dermatologists advise against for young skin due to potential irritation and sun sensitivity. Nielsen data shows that households with young children spend billions on skincare and makeup, and lawmakers are considering banning the sale of certain anti-aging cosmetics to those under 18. The article also highlights how influencers sometimes fail to properly disclose sponsored content, misleading children who may not realize they are being marketed to.</p>

          <p>Government data released on Friday revealed that Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices, marking the highest level since January 2023.

Headline inflation rose to 3.6% year-over-year, remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years.

          <p>A White House report, spearheaded by President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., attributes the rise in chronic diseases among children to factors like ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, stress, and excessive prescription drug use. The report calls for a shift in research focus towards understanding and preventing diseases, rather than solely treating them. It criticizes the influence of the food and chemical industries on federal policymaking, likening their tactics to those used by the tobacco industry. While some experts praised the report's focus on toxic chemicals, others criticized it for misrepresenting scientific consensus on issues like vaccine safety.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, testified that he fears persecution if deported, potentially leading to assassination, kidnapping, or torture for him, his wife, and infant son. Arrested in New York City and detained in Louisiana, Khalil faces deportation based on the claim that his presence hinders American foreign policy goals against antisemitism. Witnesses testified that his international prominence would make him a target, with one expert estimating a 30-40% chance of being killed if deported, compared to a 10% or less chance if he remains in the United States. The hearing concluded with the judge requesting written closing arguments.</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, a painter who accidentally became known as the 'Bagel Lady' due to her bagel art necklaces, napkin rings, wreaths, and candleholders, passed away at 87. Starting as a hobby, Blau's bagel creations gained popularity after her daughter brought a bagel necklace to school, leading to orders from Bloomingdale's. This accidental career led to a children’s book, “The Bagel Baker of Mulliner Lane,” and toy designs, including Sweetie Pops and Baby All Gone. Despite her initial plans, Blau's creative detour transformed her into a successful author, illustrator, and toy designer.</p>

          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would limit the power of federal judges to hold individuals in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The provision, included in a tax and spending cut bill, seeks to weaken federal judges by blocking enforcement of contempt citations if a bond was not previously ordered from those suing. Representative Jim Jordan stated the provision aims to target cases involving nationwide injunctions, applying retroactively to court orders made before enactment. Democrats argue that the measure would strip courts of their power by removing consequences for officials who ignore judges' rulings.</p>

Her stepfather, a lawyer specializing in workers' compensation defense, has also been charged with conspiring with her.

          <p>Amazon shareholders have rejected a proposal to adopt a policy that would require the company's CEO and board chair roles to remain separate. Approximately 82% of shareholders voted against the proposal, which was submitted alongside seven others at Amazon's annual meeting. The proposal aimed to codify the split structure, similar to most S&P 500 companies, allowing the board to focus on governance while the CEO focuses on business. Amazon urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, arguing the current policy enables the board to determine the right leadership for the company.</p>

          <p>Millions of low-income Americans could lose access to food stamps or see reductions in their monthly benefits due to House Republicans’ newly adopted tax bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill proposes stricter eligibility requirements and shifting some costs to states, potentially reducing SNAP participation by over three million people monthly. States may modify benefits or leave the program due to increased costs, resulting in 1.3 million losing access. Some households could see a $100 reduction in their monthly allowance because of a provision that would change how some benefits are computed.</p>

While some states intend to comply, others are weighing the legality of the request. Privacy experts warn of implications if federal agencies can ignore privacy protections, potentially creating powerful surveillance tools.
