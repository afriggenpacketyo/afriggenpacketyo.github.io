          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has described a public letter from U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner accusing his government of inaction against antisemitism as an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat." Macron argued that a diplomat's role is not to publicly criticize a host country's internal affairs and that Kushner's remarks were a misuse of taxpayer money. The dispute highlights the growing diplomatic friction between the Trump and Macron administrations over foreign policy, particularly regarding Israel and Palestine.</p>

          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have formally announced their recognition of a Palestinian state in a coordinated diplomatic move. This decision is intended to revive the possibility of a two-state solution and build international momentum for a lasting peace agreement. The announcement has been met with strong opposition from both the United States and Israel, who argue that it rewards Hamas and is an empty gesture given the current political divisions among Palestinians.</p>

          <p>In a commentary for the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl explains the concept of Teshuvah, or repentance, as a fundamentally hopeful and communal act. She describes how, during Rosh Hashanah, Jews collectively take responsibility for societal shortcomings rather than confessing individually. Buchdahl applies this idea to modern American society, urging a collective return to the nation's better self by acknowledging shared failings and embracing the possibility of positive change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to child psychology expert Reem Raouda, children with strong social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. The article outlines nine key practices, including talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and allowing children space to solve their own conflicts. The central message is that true social intelligence is built on a foundation of emotional safety and authentic connection at home, rather than just memorizing polite phrases.</p>

Kenya finished second in the standings, while Jamaica won the third-most medals but only one gold, marking a disappointing outcome for the traditional powerhouse.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Chris Murphy has accused President Donald Trump of using the full power of the federal government to punish his political enemies, calling it one of the most dangerous moments in American history. Murphy specifically cited Trump's threats to have the FCC investigate critical broadcasters as an illegal use of regulatory power to silence dissent.

The Palestinian territories are geographically and politically divided between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, with no elections held since 2006. This internal fragmentation, coupled with Israeli opposition, creates significant obstacles to forming the functional, unified government required for a viable state.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, has publicly called Elon Musk a "criminal," accusing him of inciting violence and allowing his social media platform, X, to host harmful content related to self-harm and child abuse. Davey's strong condemnation follows Musk's video appearance at a far-right rally in London, where he told protesters to "fight back or you die." The Liberal Democrats are now calling for a formal investigation into Musk and his company under the UK's Online Safety Act.</p>
