          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This investment is notable given the insurer's recent struggles, including a significant stock decline in 2025 and a Justice Department investigation, aligning with Buffett's history of value investing. The disclosure led to a 6% rise in UnitedHealth's stock, signaling market confidence in the move despite Buffett's past criticisms of the U.S. healthcare system. The purchase may have been initiated by one of Buffett's investment managers. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the profit warning, Tapestry anticipates low single-digit revenue growth and noted that consumer demand remains strong.

          <p>A political action committee led by former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, named Dignity of Work PAC, reportedly spent nearly $500,000 on luxury hotels, catering, and consultants while failing to pay a $50,000 tax bill on time. According to FEC filings, the spending occurred during the first half of 2025, after Brown lost his Senate seat. A PAC representative stated the late tax bill was eventually paid in full, which will be reflected in future filings. The article highlights criticism from conservative groups who accuse Brown of hypocrisy, given his history of advocating for higher taxes.</p>

The collaboration, launched in 2021, saw the opening of over 600 Ulta Beauty locations within Target stores and was previously highlighted as a key driver of store traffic. The decision could pose a challenge for Target, which has been working to attract shoppers amid declining sales and has faced recent controversies. Both companies' stocks saw a minor decline following the announcement, with analysts suggesting operational issues at Target may have contributed to the split.</p>

Obama praised their efforts, emphasizing the importance of their actions in the broader fight to protect fair elections. The Texas Democrats' departure denies the state's House the necessary quorum to vote on the newly drawn congressional maps, which are seen as heavily favoring the GOP.

          <p>A coalition of prominent religious leaders in Washington, D.C., has strongly criticized the federal government's decision to take control of the city's police force. They condemned the president's language describing the city as a "lawless wasteland" as inflammatory and counterproductive to public safety. The clergy argued that true safety is achieved through community collaboration and addressing root causes of crime, not through "fear-based governance" or a military presence. They also criticized Congress for withholding funds for social programs while highlighting that violent crime is at a 30-year low.</p>

For Gazans, the drops often lead to chaos, injuries, and inequitable distribution, as the strong overpower the weak to claim the limited resources.

          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare for a summit in Alaska, their primary objectives appear to diverge significantly. Putin seeks international recognition and a perceived victory, aiming to solidify Russia's territorial claims in Ukraine and deal directly with the U.S., sidelining European leaders. In contrast, Trump's goals seem centered on his desire to be a global peacemaker, though his vacillating statements make his precise aims difficult to predict. The meeting's location in Alaska is also symbolic, representing a historical connection between the two nations.</p>

This escalating partisan battle over mid-decade redistricting could significantly impact the balance of power in Congress.

The analysis in this article suggests the Court rigorously applies rules requiring proof of "irreparable harm" to most litigants, but has appeared to waive this standard in cases involving former President Donald Trump.

This shift, which secures about half of China's projected demand from South American sources, underscores Beijing's increasing trade reliance on the region amid ongoing tensions with Washington. The decision has effectively shortened the primary export window for American farmers, who have historically relied on this period for substantial sales to China.

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) recorded an $8 billion write-down on its "gigaproject" investments, such as the futuristic city of Neom, at the end of 2024. Despite the write-down, the fund's total assets under management grew to nearly $1 trillion, partly due to an increased allocation of shares from state oil giant Aramco. The decline in gigaproject valuation comes as the kingdom faces a growing fiscal deficit and lower global oil prices. This has forced Saudi Arabia to scale back or shelve some ambitious projects and has led the PIF to broaden its funding base.</p>

          <h2>Logistics Experts Warn Tariff-Driven Price Hikes Are Being Temporarily Masked in Supply Chain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While consumers have yet to feel the full impact of recent tariffs, logistics experts warn that price increases are currently hidden in "the middle mile" of the supply chain. U.S. importers have front-loaded orders to mitigate duties, causing inventory to build up in warehouses and distribution centers. This surge in inventory is temporarily delaying the pass-through of higher costs to retail shelves. Experts predict that as this inventory moves to stores for the holiday season, consumers will begin to see more significant price inflation on a wide range of goods.</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, researchers are developing the AI needed for humanoid robots to safely operate in the physical world. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training a robot named Ruby to perform basic kitchen tasks by learning from human motion. Researchers wear sensors to capture data on force and movement, teaching the machines the nuances of physical interaction, such as how tightly to grip an object. The goal is to create versatile robots that can adapt to changing, human-centered environments, moving beyond the repetitive tasks of current industrial robots.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin is shadowed by their complex history, which has ranged from public deference to recent expressions of frustration. At a 2018 Helsinki summit, Trump famously appeared to side with Putin's denial of election interference over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies. However, as the war in Ukraine has dragged on, Trump has voiced irritation with Putin and approved weapons sales to aid Ukraine. This vacillating dynamic adds a layer of unpredictability to the talks in Anchorage, as Trump's desire for a peace deal clashes with his recent skepticism.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to block a Mississippi law requiring social media companies to verify users' ages and obtain parental consent for minors. The decision allows the law to go into effect while legal challenges continue in lower courts. A tech industry group, NetChoice, had sued to block the law, arguing it unconstitutionally restricts free speech for all users. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the law is likely unconstitutional under current precedents but agreed with the Court's decision not to grant interim relief on procedural grounds.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, for the first time since 2017. The new recommendations advise forgoing alcohol entirely, citing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure, a shift from previous advice that allowed for moderate consumption. The guidelines also push for more aggressive treatment, suggesting medication if lifestyle changes fail to lower blood pressure in individuals with systolic readings in the 130-139 range. Additionally, there is a new emphasis on controlling blood pressure to reduce the risk of dementia.</p>

          <p>German soccer club Bayern Munich has ended its commercial branding deal with "Visit Rwanda" following significant pressure from fans and human rights activists. The partnership drew criticism due to Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged role in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Instead of a complete separation, Bayern announced a new "strategic evolution" of the partnership, which will now focus on youth football development through an academy in Kigali. Analysts suggest the move was a forced climbdown due to public relations concerns rather than a purely moral decision.</p>
