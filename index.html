          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 3-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, highlighting their offensive struggles despite entering a favorable stretch of their schedule. Blake Snell, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, gave up three runs, while the offense managed only three hits against Zac Gallen. The Dodgers' inability to capitalize on opportunities against the Diamondbacks' bullpen further contributed to the defeat, snapping their four-game winning streak. Despite the loss, Freddie Freeman and Alex Call returned to action after missing a previous game due to injuries, providing a slight boost to the team.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expanding the use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants detained in the U.S., a setback to Trump's deportation plans. Judge Jia Cobb argued that the expanded use of expedited removal may infringe on due process rights, stating that the government's argument that undocumented migrants are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment is startling. The ruling halts the fast-track deportation of migrants who have been in the U.S. for less than two years, a policy expanded by the Trump administration. Cobb's decision mandates that the government must afford due process to those subjected to expedited removal, a ruling that could benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

          <p>An extensive earthen wall is being constructed around the besieged Sudanese city of el-Fasher, potentially trapping residents inside, according to research from Yale University. Satellite images show more than 31km of "berms" built since May in territory occupied by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). El-Fasher is the last major foothold in Darfur for the army, which has been battling the RSF since April 2023, and the RSF is intensifying its offensive, deliberately targeting civilians. The construction of the wall deepens siege conditions, complicating efforts for civilians to flee or receive essential supplies. Optimism score is not mentioned in the summary.</p>

          <p>Live-fire military training has sparked hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with unexploded shells often hindering firefighting efforts. Figures show that 385 out of 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land were caused by present-day army maneuvers. Locals near the sites feel the MoD needs to do more to prevent fires, including banning live fire training in the driest months. The MoD stated it has a robust wildfire policy and monitors risk levels, but old unexploded ordnance from previous maneuvers makes fighting the fires more challenging.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked Donald Trump’s plans to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans living and working in the U.S., stating that the administration's actions were unlawful. The court upheld a lower court ruling, maintaining TPS while holders challenge the administration’s actions. The judges found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to vacate a prior extension of TPS. Congress authorized TPS in 1990 to grant legal status to those fleeing countries experiencing civil strife or disaster. Optimism score is not mentioned in the summary.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, calling it an "invasion" and alleging that the president has aims beyond fighting crime. Pritzker argued that Trump's plan could be a move to "stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections." The White House spokeswoman rejected Pritzker's accusations, citing the city's violent crime rate. The deployments in other cities have drawn criticism, with officials arguing local police are better equipped to handle crime. Optimism score is not mentioned in the summary.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has cancelled $4.9 billion of congressionally approved foreign aid funding, asserting that he would "put AMERICA FIRST!" in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson. Democratic lawmakers opposed the move, arguing that Trump's decision increases the likelihood of a federal shutdown later in the year. Trump bypassed Congress with a "pocket rescission," a procedure that has not been used in nearly 50 years. The cuts are expected to impact USAID funding and peacekeeping missions, drawing criticism from both Democratic and some Republican politicians. Optimism score is not mentioned in the summary.</p>

The mentoring project, run by Power2, works across a 16-week period where teenagers visit a local nursery once a week and mentor a child, and the charity helps 27,000 children and young people to re-engage with school.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation reexamined the case and found inconsistencies in Pusser's account, along with evidence suggesting Pauline suffered domestic violence. An autopsy revealed that Pauline was likely shot outside the car and placed inside, contradicting Pusser's statements. Prosecutors stated that if Pusser were alive today, they would present an indictment to a grand jury for the killing of Pauline. Optimism score is not mentioned in the summary.</p>
