          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving a life sentence for the murders of her two children, has been found guilty in Arizona of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Prosecutors argued that Daybell conspired with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill Vallow in 2019 in order to collect life insurance money and be with Chad Daybell. The jury reached the verdict after a relatively short deliberation, and Daybell, who represented herself, now faces another life sentence. This conviction adds to her already extensive legal troubles related to multiple deaths and conspiracy charges.</p>

          <p>Three federal prosecutors resigned after being pressured to express regret or admit wrongdoing in connection with the dismissed corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The prosecutors claim the Justice Department prioritized obedience over ethical obligations and legal principles. The case against Adams, which involved illegal campaign contributions and travel perks, was dropped after President Trump took office, leading to accusations of political interference. This controversy highlights concerns about the weaponization of the Justice Department and the erosion of its independence.</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, responding to growing public concern about their potential health effects, particularly in children. This decision follows increasing state-level bans and pressure from health advocates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has called sugar "poison" and has been pushing for better food labeling and the elimination of harmful additives. While not a complete ban, this move signals a significant shift towards healthier food standards, though the effectiveness depends on cooperation from the food industry.</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter profit plunged 71% to $409 million, impacted by looming tariffs and brand crisis linked to Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration.

          <p>The Democratic Party is facing significant internal divisions regarding how to address the challenges posed by Donald Trump's second term. Some Democrats advocate for fighting Trump's policies and defending vulnerable communities, while others suggest a more moderate approach to win back disillusioned Trump voters. The party is also grappling with low confidence ratings and disagreements over strategy, including debates over generational leadership and ideological priorities. This infighting reflects a broader uncertainty about the party's direction and its ability to effectively counter Trumpism.</p>
