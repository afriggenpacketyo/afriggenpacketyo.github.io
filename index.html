          <p>New York Jets right guard Alijah Vera-Tucker will miss the entire season after tearing his triceps in practice, a significant blow to the team's offense just days before their first game. Head coach Aaron Glenn confirmed the injury and stated the team is evaluating replacements, with options including backup Xavier Newman or shifting center Joe Tippmann to guard. Vera-Tucker, a former first-round pick and recently named team captain, has a history of season-ending injuries, having missed substantial time in both 2022 and 2023.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Broadcom announced fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, largely due to a 63% year-over-year increase in revenue from artificial intelligence products, which reached $5.2 billion. The company's overall revenue grew 22% to $15.96 billion, and it provided a strong sales forecast for the fourth quarter. Broadcom, which develops custom AI accelerators and networking components for major cloud companies, has seen its stock value double in the past year as it positions itself as a competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip market.

The company's projected full-year earnings of $12.77 to $12.97 per share are well below the $14.45 anticipated by analysts, reflecting challenges in its U.S. business and product execution.

          <p>President Trump has escalated a legal battle to the Supreme Court, seeking permission to fire Federal Trade Commission commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. Lower courts previously ruled her termination was illegal and ordered her reinstatement, arguing that FTC commissioners can only be removed for cause, such as neglect or malfeasance. The White House contends the president has the authority to remove heads of executive agencies, citing recent precedents. This case is part of a broader effort by the administration to assert control over federal regulators, including a similar move against a Federal Reserve governor.</p>

This deal aligns with a recent executive order from President Trump designed to allow 401(k) plans to include alternative assets, potentially revitalizing T.

During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and the club reached a Champions League final, but he also faced consistent criticism from fans over a perceived lack of on-field investment and only two major trophies.

          <p>The "$1,000 a month rule" is a guideline designed to help individuals calculate how much they need to save to generate a specific monthly income in retirement. Based on the 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that for every $1,000 of desired monthly income, a retiree needs between $240,000 and $300,000 in savings. For example, to generate $4,000 per month beyond Social Security, one would need a nest egg of approximately $960,000 to $1.2 million. This framework helps make abstract retirement planning more concrete and underscores the importance of starting to save early. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mass stabbing at the Hollow Water First Nation in Manitoba, Canada, has resulted in the death of one person and injuries to at least six others. The suspect in the attack also died during the incident, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Authorities described it as a "mass casualty" event and have assured the public there is no ongoing risk, though a heavy police presence remains in the remote community. The incident occurred on the third anniversary of another deadly mass stabbing in Saskatchewan, shaking the small Anishinaabe community.</p>

          <p>During a Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused former CDC Director Susan Monarez of lying. Monarez, who was fired after less than a month in the role, wrote in an op-ed that Kennedy pressured her to preapprove recommendations from a new vaccine advisory panel he had filled with vaccine skeptics. When questioned by senators, Kennedy flatly denied this, stating "Yes, sir," when asked if she was lying. He later claimed he asked for her resignation because she admitted to not being a trustworthy person.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has announced a significant investment to help distribute lenacapavir, a new long-acting injectable HIV prevention drug, to up to 2 million people in low- and middle-income countries by 2028. Hailed as a "game changer," the drug provides nearly complete protection against HIV with just two injections per year. This move marks a renewed U.S. commitment to global HIV prevention through PEPFAR, following an administrative halt on foreign aid that severely impacted such programs. The partnership involves the Global Fund and the drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, aiming to curb new infections and save lives.</p>

          <p>After seven consecutive months of declining visitation, Las Vegas is launching a new marketing campaign to attract tourists by emphasizing value. MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle acknowledged that the city needs to better communicate its affordable options, as perceptions of high prices have deterred some visitors. He also noted that the slump could be an indicator for broader U.S. travel challenges, citing a 40% drop in Canadian visitors and significant hikes in U.S. visa fees. While luxury travel remains strong, budget-conscious travelers and small businesses are showing spending restraint.</p>

Robin Westman, 23, spent 40 minutes in the store the weekend before the attack, where he legally purchased a revolver after passing a background check. However, that gun was not used in the shooting at the Church of the Annunciation, where Westman killed two children and injured 21 others with an assault-style rifle and other firearms.

          <p>Montana's ancient limber pine forests are under severe threat from white pine blister rust, an invasive fungus introduced to North America in the 1930s. A long-term U.S. Forest Service study reveals that 43% of the limber pines in its survey area are already dead, with another 21% in decline. These iconic trees, some over 500 years old, are crucial for the ecosystem, providing food and shelter for wildlife and anchoring soils. Because the trees have no natural defense against the fungus, their rapid die-off threatens to unravel the entire Rocky Mountain Front ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A legal analysis suggests that the Trump administration's petition to the Supreme Court regarding its tariff policy contains arguments that could invalidate the tariffs under the court's own "major questions doctrine." The administration describes the tariffs as a "most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative" with a multi-trillion-dollar impact, a scale the conservative justices previously deemed "staggering" when striking down a Biden-era policy. However, the article notes that the justices may seek to create an exception for the president or for foreign policy, raising questions about the consistent application of their own legal doctrines.</p>

To offset the cost, the proposal would expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000, raising the current cap. This contrasts with the recently passed Republican tax law, which offers a temporary, income-limited deduction for seniors.
