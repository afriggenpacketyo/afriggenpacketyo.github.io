          <h2>RFK Jr. Aims to Phase Out Artificial Food Dyes in the US by 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 18:13:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the American food supply by the end of next year. The agencies intend to collaborate with food companies to transition from petrochemical-based dyes to natural alternatives, citing studies linking synthetic dyes to health conditions like ADHD, obesity, and cancer. While the International Association of Color Manufacturers questioned the proposed timeline, several states have already begun banning artificial dyes in school lunches, indicating a growing movement towards healthier food options. The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>President Trump clarified that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing Powell's handling of interest rates. Trump reiterated his view that it is an opportune time to lower interest rates but acknowledged that the decision ultimately rests with Powell. This statement follows earlier speculation about Powell's potential removal, fueled by Trump's social media posts expressing dissatisfaction with the Fed's policies. Powell's term extends until May 2026, and he has previously stated that he would not resign even if asked.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is urging the food industry to voluntarily discontinue the use of synthetic food dyes, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goal of replacing them with natural alternatives. While stopping short of an outright ban, the FDA aims to establish a national standard and timeline for the industry to make the switch. The International Association of Color Manufacturers expressed concerns about the feasibility of the proposed timeline, but the FDA remains optimistic about collaborating with the food industry to achieve this transition. This initiative stems from concerns about the potential health risks associated with artificial dyes, particularly in children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry have joined forces to lobby the Trump administration against the imposition of 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups warn that these tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already facing financial difficulties and may not be able to absorb the additional costs. They argue that the tariffs could lead to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies throughout the industry. This united front is a rare occurrence, highlighting the severity of the potential impact of the tariffs on the automotive sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America (VOA), a government-funded broadcaster. Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the administration to reinstate VOA employees and contractors who had been suspended following an executive order. The judge deemed the administration's decision "arbitrary and capricious" and potentially in violation of federal laws. This ruling is a victory for unions, journalist organizations, and democracy advocates who argued that the dismantling of VOA would undermine national security by ceding the global information space to adversaries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has issued a complaint stating that Amazon is legally obligated to bargain collectively with warehouse workers at its San Francisco distribution facility. This decision is based on the precedent that if a union secures majority support in a workplace, the employer must either voluntarily recognize the union or challenge the action with the labor board. Amazon disputes the claims, but the complaint sets the stage for potential bargaining orders at other Amazon locations where workers have sought union recognition. However, the case may face challenges due to the Trump administration's control over the NLRB.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced he will reduce his involvement with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in May, allocating more time to Tesla.

The company is also facing increased competition and potential tariff-related challenges in China.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk faces increasing pressure from investors to dedicate more time to the electric car maker, as first-quarter results reveal a decline in sales and profit. Investors have voiced concerns about Musk's focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its potential negative impact on Tesla's performance. Tesla's stock price has fallen significantly, and analysts suggest that Musk's political activities have alienated some consumers. The company's earnings report acknowledged the potential impact of trade policy and changing political sentiment on demand.</p>

The students, who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, were arrested as part of the White House's crackdown on alleged antisemitism on college campuses. Lawmakers accused the Trump administration of intentionally relocating the students to a conservative jurisdiction to facilitate their deportation. The students' legal teams are challenging their detentions and seeking their release, while raising concerns about due process and political motivations.</p>

By examining China's policymaking trifecta of philosophy, power, and pragmatism, Trump could find inspiration for stabilizing America and addressing income inequality.</p>
