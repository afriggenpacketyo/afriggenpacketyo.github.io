          <p>Northampton director of rugby Phil Dowson criticized Bordeaux-Begles players for their behavior following Saints' Champions Cup final defeat, alleging that Henry Pollock was grabbed around the neck. Dowson stated that Pollock was upset by the incident, which he deemed uncalled for and out of order, and indicated that officials would address the situation. The confrontation occurred after an argument between Pollock and Bordeaux fly-half Mathieu Jalibert, who claimed Northampton had disrespected their club by calling them mercenaries. Jalibert emphasized the importance of respecting all clubs, despite differing approaches to match preparation, highlighting the intensity and emotions involved in high-stakes rugby competitions.</p>

          <p>Jorge Humberto Figueroa, a leader of the Sinaloa cartel with a $1 million U.S. bounty on his head, was killed in a clash with Mexican army troops during an arrest raid.

The Sinaloa state is currently experiencing a war between two rival factions, resulting in numerous deaths since September, and Figueroa belonged to the faction led by Guzman's sons, known as the Chapitos.</p>

          <p>The government is considering new regulations that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to complete projects within set time frames. These rules are part of a broader plan to construct 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, requiring developers to commit to delivery schedules and submit annual progress reports. Developers who repeatedly miss targets may face penalties and be denied future permissions, with fines potentially reaching thousands of pounds per unbuilt home. Housing charity Shelter supports the plans, accusing developers of deliberately delaying construction to inflate prices and avoid building social housing, while emphasizing the need for increased social housing construction by councils and housing associations.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a lengthy and politically infused speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, addressing the graduating class of 2025. Trump used the opportunity to highlight his administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, asserting that the military's role is to dominate foes and spread democracy through force. He also discussed immigration, praised figures like golfer Gary Player and real estate developer William Levitt, and claimed to have faced more investigations than Al Capone. The speech followed controversy from a previous West Point address where Trump's ability to walk down a ramp was questioned, this time exiting via a staircase.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after mistakenly arresting Ximena Arias Cristobal, an undocumented college student, during a traffic stop, leading to her detention by ICE. The officer initially pulled over Arias-Cristobal for an improper turn and driving without a license, but after reviewing dashcam footage, authorities realized the mistake and dismissed the charges. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 4, was released from ICE detention after an immigration judge granted her bond, and her father, also detained by ICE, was similarly released, though both still face deportation proceedings.</p>

The man, who is gay, had been attacked twice in Guatemala due to his sexual orientation and was later raped and held for ransom in Mexico, and the judge found that his deportation lacked due process. This order adds to a series of court rulings against the Trump administration's deportation policies, with the judge noting that facilitating the man's return should be less complicated since he is not held by any foreign government.</p>

The plan involves private contractors, including a security group run by a former C.I.A. officer, distributing aid in Israeli-controlled zones, and it was designed to prevent food from falling into the hands of militants or the black market. U.N. officials have criticized the plan, warning that it could restrict aid to limited areas and endanger civilians, while Israeli officials claim it will move distribution out of chaotic areas and into zones under Israeli military control.</p>

          <p>French authorities are investigating suspected arson as a possible cause of a major power outage in southeast France, which disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. The power outage, affecting about 160,000 households, was caused by a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes and a fallen high-voltage line, and authorities are investigating the likelihood of arson. Despite the disruption, the Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an independent power supply, while traffic lights and train services were affected in the surrounding area.</p>
