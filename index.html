          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard is actively monitoring a Chinese-flagged research icebreaker, the Xue Long 2, which was detected operating within the U.S. Extended Continental Shelf off the coast of Alaska. This event occurs amidst heightened vigilance due to recent activity by Russian and Chinese military aircraft in the region. The Coast Guard emphasized its commitment to defending U.S. sovereign interests and territorial integrity against foreign government vessel activity. The incident underscores the growing geopolitical focus on the Arctic.</p>

          <p>In a lighthearted story from the Pittsburgh Steelers training camp, quarterback Aaron Rodgers has established a unique rule for his suitemate, DK Metcalf. Due to an exceptionally loud toilet in their shared dorm bathroom, Rodgers requested that Metcalf refrain from flushing it late at night to avoid disturbing his sleep. The two are rooming together as a way to build off-field chemistry ahead of the upcoming NFL season. This amusing arrangement highlights the personal dynamics of professional athletes during camp.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing regulations to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of many establishments. Under the proposed changes, developers building new residential properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing. The reforms also aim to streamline permissions for new businesses and outdoor service areas, hoping to revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry. This policy shift is a response to campaigns from venues facing closure due to noise issues.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected a large-scale effort to recall 24 opposition lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, thereby preserving the opposition's controlling majority in the legislature. This outcome ensures that the political gridlock facing President William Lai's administration is likely to persist, as his Democratic Progressive Party lacks the votes to pass its agenda without compromise. The recall campaign was initiated by groups who accused the opposition of undermining national security and being overly friendly toward China.</p>
