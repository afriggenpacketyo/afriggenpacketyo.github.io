          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The nationalized service, now the responsibility of DfT Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), commenced its operations on time. While Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander refrained from promising lower fares, she assured passengers of "great value for money" and improved services with reinvested profits. Unions have voiced concerns about potential outsourcing, while the Conservatives have called for Labour to deliver on their promises, highlighting the political implications of this move.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Mykolaiv. Residential buildings were damaged and set ablaze, forcing many to seek shelter in underground metro stations. The Russian defense ministry claimed to have intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions during the same period, with no reported casualties. These attacks occurred as Russia and Ukraine engaged in prisoner swaps, exchanging hundreds of soldiers and civilians in what is considered the largest exchange since the start of the conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. Special Envoy Thomas Barrack met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Istanbul, praising the leader's steps regarding foreign fighters and relations with Israel. This meeting follows the U.S. administration's decision to effectively lift sanctions on Syria after a 14-year civil war, a move welcomed by Syria as a "positive step." Discussions mainly centered on implementing the sanctions waiver, with Sharaa emphasizing that sanctions continue to burden Syrians and impede economic recovery. They also explored ways to support foreign investments in Syria, particularly in energy and infrastructure, with the Syrian side expressing readiness to facilitate investor attraction and reconstruction efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite securing significant trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union, boosting the British economy, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval ratings have plummeted. A recent YouGov poll indicates a record low approval, particularly among Labour voters, due to cost-of-living pressures and business concerns over tax policies. While businesses acknowledge the government's progress on international trade, domestic policies are viewed as "anti-growth" measures. Critics point to Starmer's lack of charisma, contrasting him with figures like Nigel Farage, although some business leaders remain positive about the overall direction.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways has become the first private operator in the UK to return to public ownership, marking a significant step in the Labour government's plan to renationalize the country's rail services. The move aims to address the poor reputation of Britain's railways, characterized by frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. Rail unions have welcomed the takeover, while the government anticipates saving up to Â£150 million in compensation fees. The renationalization is expected to end decades of fragmentation and improve service for passengers.</p>

The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was lured to Woeltz's home under the pretense of retrieving Bitcoin, but was instead tied up and tortured for several weeks. He managed to escape and alert authorities, who found evidence of torture, including weapons and disturbing photographs. Woeltz is considered a flight risk and remains in custody, while a second person initially arrested in connection with the case has been released pending further investigation.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market continues to outperform the national trend, with affluent buyers investing in luxury homes as a means of preserving value amid economic uncertainty. All 64 units at One Central Park, a luxury development in the Huangpu district, were quickly sold, generating 4 billion yuan (US$556 million). This follows the project's previous sell-out rounds, bringing its year-to-date sales to over 10.8 billion yuan. The high demand triggered a points-based allocation system to curb speculative buying, reflecting the sustained strength in Shanghai's luxury home sales.</p>

Additionally, chefs will be allowed to opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of living at diplomatic establishments.
