          <p>BYD has overtaken Tesla in European battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales for the first time, selling 7,231 units in April, a 169% year-on-year increase, while Tesla's sales fell by 49% to 7,165 units; this is despite the EU imposing tariffs on Chinese carmakers. This shift signifies a pivotal moment in Europe's automotive market, where BEVs accounted for 17% of new car registrations in April, up from 13.4% the previous year. Chinese firms' BEV sales surged by 59% despite the tariffs, highlighting their growing influence in the European electric vehicle sector. The article suggests that BYD's growth could be attributed to its focus on plug-in hybrids as well as BEVs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gaby Hinsliff explores the rise of the "DEI hire" taunt in political discourse, particularly within MAGA circles, and its implications for equality and inclusion. The article references the case of Wayne Brown, Britain’s first black fire chief who took his own life after facing relentless harassment, and Donald Trump's attempt to blame a helicopter crash on DEI hiring policies. It discusses how this rhetoric feeds an age-old grievance and creates a climate where prejudice can be voiced more confidently, potentially undermining the confidence of individuals from non-traditional backgrounds. The author warns against the erosion of progress towards equality and the importance of actively combating such prejudices to maintain a fair society.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece from The New York Times, Lydia Polgreen discusses the meeting between President Trump and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, highlighting the stark contrast between Trump's focus on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide and Ramaphosa's attempts to address economic issues and trade. Trump hijacked the meeting to focus on a racist fantasy of white South Africans suffering genocide at the hands of a Black majority. The article underscores how Trump's actions served to score points with his base rather than engage in meaningful diplomacy, while also revealing the complex racial and economic dynamics within South Africa, where inequality persists despite the end of apartheid. The meeting exposed the folly of Trump's approach to global leadership and the missed opportunity for constructive dialogue.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for the top investors in his personal cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, sparking controversy and condemnation. The New York Times reports that the event, protested by activists, saw attendees explicitly seeking to influence U.S. financial regulations. Trump promised to champion the crypto industry, criticizing the previous administration's enforcement actions. This event, unlike any recent American history, raises ethical questions about a sitting president directly profiting from a memecoin, with critics labeling it a historic corruption of the presidency.</p>
