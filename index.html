The discussions included trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security, but officials remained silent on Nippon Steel Corp.'s acquisition plans for United States Steel Corp.

          <p>The Trump administration is significantly restructuring the National Security Council, reducing its staff by at least half, according to sources. This downsizing is expected to streamline foreign policy decision-making, aligning with President Trump's preference for top-down approaches. Some NSC officials are returning to their original agencies, while others are being placed on administrative leave, and certain teams focusing on specific regions or issues will be eliminated or consolidated. Andy Baker, Vice President Vanceâ€™s national security advisor, will take a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have announced their departure to form a new law firm, a significant blow following the firm's controversial deal with the Trump administration. The deal, brokered by firm chairman Brad Karp, aimed to prevent an executive order restricting the firm's business, but it drew widespread criticism from associates, other firms, and Democrats. The departing partners did not directly address the deal in their announcement, but their exit follows other prominent lawyers leaving the firm in recent weeks. Dunn played a key role in debate preparation for prominent Democratic figures.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are raising concerns about the impact of cuts to National Weather Service balloon sites on the accuracy of weather forecasts. The Department of Government Efficiency's decision to reduce or eliminate balloon sites has left gaps in data, potentially affecting the ability to forecast severe weather events. Meteorologists emphasize that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture that cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar. While NOAA defends its forecasting capabilities, some meteorologists fear the cuts could compromise public safety.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for New Orleans jail escapees has come under scrutiny, with authorities stating that cameras run by a private organization helped recapture one fugitive. Despite the police department pausing automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., the technology was used in the manhunt, raising constitutional and privacy concerns. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, have expressed concerns about the use of live facial recognition and the potential for bias and error.

          <p>A new study suggests that the prevalence of hummingbird feeders has altered the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks in the western United States. The study found that beaks became longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, and males' beaks grew pointier for fighting off competitors. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward. The study highlights how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of organisms, and scientists suggest monitoring these changes.</p>
