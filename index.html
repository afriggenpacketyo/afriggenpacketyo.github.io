          <p>California's parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who, along with his brother Lyle, was convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. Menendez, who argued he is no longer a public safety risk, must wait at least three years for another hearing. The brothers have long claimed they acted in self-defense against parental abuse, a point their attorneys maintain, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office opposes their release, stating they have not taken full responsibility for their crimes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked new construction and the transfer of new detainees to a Florida immigration facility dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," citing environmental risks to the Everglades. The ruling supports a lawsuit by the Miccosukee tribe and environmental groups who argued that required environmental reviews were not conducted. While existing operations can continue, the decision is a setback for Florida's efforts to assist the Trump administration's immigration policies by expanding detention capacity in ecologically sensitive areas.</p>

The path to a resolution remains uncertain, with Zelenskyy noting that it is unclear what territorial concessions Russia would be willing to make to end the war.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has removed a large illegal marijuana cultivation site from Sequoia National Park, clearing nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash. The operation caused significant environmental damage, including diverting a creek and contaminating the area with methamidophos, a highly toxic insecticide banned in the U.S. For two decades, drug-trafficking organizations have used the park's vast wilderness for such grows, posing a threat to wildlife, water sources, and public safety.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% the previous month but still above economists' forecasts. The cooling was partly attributed to a significant easing in rice price inflation, which had previously surged. Despite the slowdown, the "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the Bank of Japan, held steady at 3.4%, indicating persistent underlying price pressures in the economy.

          <p>The global race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying. China and Russia are considered leaders in the field, having invested heavily in the technology, while the U.S. and UK are now working to catch up after years of focusing on counter-terrorism. These weapons pose a significant strategic threat because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult for current defense systems to detect and intercept.</p>

          <p>American midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact for Aberdeen, coming off the bench to score a crucial goal and lead a comeback in their Europa League play-off match against FCSB. After being down 2-0, Polvara's impressive goal just three minutes after entering the game helped his team secure a 2-2 draw. The fan-favorite's performance has increased calls for him to be given a starting role, especially after being used sparingly by the manager so far this season.</p>

This action represents a further escalation in the administration's campaign against the Federal Reserve's independence, though the Fed chair does not have the legal authority to fire a governor.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project on a sacred Apache site in Arizona, meeting with mining executives and criticizing a court decision that temporarily blocked it. A federal appeals court recently paused the transfer of the land, known as Oak Flat, to the mining companies, giving the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other opponents a reprieve in their long-running legal battle. The tribe argues the mine would destroy a sacred site, while proponents, including Trump, emphasize the economic benefits and the nation's need for copper.</p>

Non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state, were kept in place, and the New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision on the fine.</p>
