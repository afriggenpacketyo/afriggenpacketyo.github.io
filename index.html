          <p>The Coca-Cola Company reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to climb. Despite the positive results, the beverage giant acknowledged that consumer demand remains soft, particularly among low-income U.S. consumers, with unit case volume showing only a 1% increase. The company is focusing on "affordable" options like mini cans to target price-sensitive buyers while reiterating its full-year financial forecast. Growth was primarily driven by its water, sports, coffee, and tea segment, while its sparkling soft drinks volume was flat. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. cattle ranchers are raising alarms over the potential return of the screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite recently found near the Mexican border. This biosecurity threat compounds existing pressures on the domestic beef supply, which is already strained by drought and the smallest cattle herd since 1951. Ranchers argue that importing beef from Argentina, a proposal floated by President Trump, is a short-term fix that undermines domestic producers and ignores long-term issues like disease prevention and market stability. They contend that government focus should be on biosecurity, not market manipulation, to ensure a resilient food supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman described Donald Trump as "the most pro-business president we've ever had" during a television interview. He credited the Trump administration's infrastructure and tax policies for creating a favorable environment for businesses and noted the Federal Reserve's accommodative stance on interest rates. While Ackman initially had concerns about Trump's tariff policies, he stated his trust in the president's judgment has been affirmed. He also commented on New York City politics, urging business leaders to oppose the mayoral candidacy of Zohran Mamdani, whom he characterized as a socialist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A third survivor has resigned from the advisory panel for the UK's inquiry into grooming gangs, citing concerns over the process and potential conflicts of interest. The resignation follows those of two other survivors who were worried about "establishment insiders" being considered to chair the inquiry. One of the departed panelists expressed concern that the inquiry was being widened in a way that downplays the racial and religious motivations behind the abuse. The government's handling of the inquiry has been criticized as "descending into chaos," though the Safeguarding Minister has defended the process and stated her door remains open to all victims.</p>

Brooks contends that the system is designed for failure and profits from brokenness, calling for systemic change, including greater school choice through voucher programs.

While business groups like the British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the plans, others, such as the Federation of Small Businesses, remain skeptical, stating the true test will be whether the upcoming Budget avoids new tax burdens.

          <p>A cultural analysis of the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" re-examines its plot through a modern lens, focusing on the troubling romantic relationship between the adult male coach and a teenage player. The article argues that what was presented as a romantic subplot is now widely recognized as an inappropriate abuse of power, especially in light of real-world scandals in women's soccer. It notes that while the film brilliantly tackled issues of racism, sexism, and cultural identity, this central relationship normalizes behavior that is now viewed as grooming. The piece suggests a potential sequel would need to address this problematic dynamic directly.</p>

Key strategies include thoroughly understanding the gaps in one's Medicare plan, such as the lack of coverage for dental, vision, and long-term care. Building a dedicated medical emergency fund of $5,000 to $10,000 is also recommended to act as a financial buffer. Additionally, seniors should review supplemental coverage options like Medigap or Medicare Advantage plans and specifically plan for potential long-term care needs, which can be one of the most significant retirement expenses.

This arrangement, which requires him to pay for the property's upkeep, makes him financially secure in the residence but reluctant to leave.

Furthermore, the shutdown could delay the release of key inflation data, which in turn might postpone the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>A resident of Kwigillingok, Alaska, survived a terrifying ordeal when remnants of Typhoon Halong generated storms so powerful they lifted his home from its foundation and floated it for roughly a mile. Steven Anaver was inside his house as it was carried across choppy waters, documenting the harrowing experience as furniture floated around him and the structure was battered by waves. The severe storms devastated several small western Alaskan communities, displacing over 2,000 people and causing at least one fatality. Anaver was eventually rescued by neighbors after his drifting home came to rest on a small hill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become more frequent over the past four decades. Before 1980, agencies largely continued to operate during funding gaps, but legal opinions from the Carter administration changed this practice. President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns, while the longest, a 34-day impasse, occurred under President Donald Trump in 2018 over border wall funding. These events, often stemming from partisan standoffs over policy issues like healthcare or immigration, have resulted in furloughed federal workers and significant economic costs, highlighting a recurring pattern of political brinkmanship in Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several states are warning that November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) may not be paid if the federal government shutdown continues. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the food stamp program, has informed states of insufficient funds for a full November payment and instructed them to pause processing. This puts over 40 million Americans who rely on SNAP for groceries at risk of losing crucial support. While the USDA has contingency funds that could be used, it remains unclear if the agency will tap into them, leaving millions of low-income families in a state of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Increasing scrutiny is being placed on President Donald Trump's public statements, which have often been confusing, rambling, and factually incorrect, raising questions about his fitness for office. Recent examples include disjointed remarks about a White House ballroom renovation and strange tangents about water pressure and former presidents. This has led some critics to call for invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of a president unable to discharge their duties. However, legal experts note the bar for removal is extremely high, requiring support from the Vice President and a majority of the cabinet, followed by a two-thirds vote in Congress if the president contests it.</p>

          <p>Gavin Plumb, a security guard convicted of plotting to kidnap, sexually assault, and murder television presenter Holly Willoughby, has had his appeal against his sentence dismissed. Plumb is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 16 years after an undercover U.S. police officer uncovered his detailed plans, which included a "kidnap kit" found in his home. The Court of Appeal judges upheld the original sentence, ruling that Plumb intended harm "of the gravest and highest possible kind." The court rejected the defense's argument that the sentence was excessive, affirming the severity of the threat posed by the "horrifying" plot.</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, a region suffering from extreme poverty and a collapsing fishery, a novel conservation project is underway to restore marine life by building artificial reefs. The initiative aims to provide new habitats for fish, thereby boosting local catches and improving food security for coastal communities that depend entirely on the ocean for survival. This people-centric approach avoids traditional fishing restrictions, which often fail in places where survival is paramount. The project is part of a large-scale study linking ecosystem restoration directly to human health, testing whether environmental interventions can serve as effective public health solutions in impoverished nations.</p>

China's statement emphasized that global supply chains are a result of market choices and called for normal economic cooperation, coming shortly after Beijing itself imposed stricter export controls on these strategic minerals.

The warning follows several high-profile incidents involving British tourists who have become seriously ill or died after consuming counterfeit alcohol. Methanol, a toxic industrial chemical, is sometimes illicitly added to drinks by unscrupulous vendors to cut costs. The Foreign Office is urging travelers to purchase sealed drinks from licensed venues and to be aware of symptoms like blurry vision, which can indicate poisoning and require immediate medical attention.</p>
