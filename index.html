          <p>Twelve US states, led by New York, filed a lawsuit to challenge President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he lacks the authority to impose them without congressional approval.  The lawsuit questions the legality of Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the tariffs.  The states contend that the tariffs have caused significant economic disruption.  The legal challenge highlights the ongoing debate over the president's authority to implement trade policies.</p>
