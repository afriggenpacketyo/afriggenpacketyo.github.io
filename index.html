          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to express their concerns regarding "unilateral tariff measures" imposed by the United States, according to a draft of the summit chairman's statement. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim highlighted ASEAN's resilience amid complex global developments, noting the strain on the global trading system due to recent U.S. tariffs. The ASEAN countries, like others, anticipate being affected by Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which range from 10 to 49 percent. The leaders will warn that the tariffs pose complex challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration, while reaffirming their commitment to a multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core.</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a fourth official, Ri Hyong Son, the vice department director of the Munitions Industry Department of the Party Central Committee, in connection with the failed launch of a new navy warship. The accident, which occurred last Wednesday, resulted in damage to the bottom of the 5,000-ton destroyer. Ri Hyong Son is the most senior official detained thus far, following the detention of three shipyard officials earlier in the week. Kim Jong Un has condemned the incident as a criminal act caused by carelessness, and work is underway to restore the warship's balance.</p>

          <p>As South Korea prepares for its upcoming presidential election, many women feel their priorities, such as safety and fairness, are being overlooked. Despite women playing a significant role in protests against the previous president, the current candidates are hesitant to address gender-based discrimination due to concerns about alienating young male voters. Both leading candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, are not actively campaigning on women's issues, leaving many women feeling they have limited options. While Lee has proposed measures like stricter punishments for dating violence and digital sex crimes, he remains silent on key issues like anti-discrimination legislation and expanding the definition of sexual assault to include sex without consent.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles, aiming to decrease soaring prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This action follows newly appointed farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi's pledge to address rising rice prices, which have strained household budgets amid broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system. Koizumi emphasized the urgency to alleviate public concerns, as supermarket rice prices reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, roughly double the previous year's level.</p>

The meeting included representatives from European and Arab nations, along with Brazil and Turkey, as international pressure grows on Israel to halt its military offensive. Spain has been a vocal critic of Israel, officially recognizing Palestine as a state last year.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine article suggests that Beijing could cripple Taiwan by targeting key infrastructure nodes, leading to a cascading system collapse. The article identifies 30 to 40 "super critical" targets, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, whose destruction could disrupt essential services. This tactic, termed "urban collapse warfare," aims to undermine the Taiwanese population's will to resist, creating conditions for a bloodless victory. The article highlights Taiwan's dependence on imported energy and vulnerability to natural disasters as factors making it susceptible to this strategy.</p>
