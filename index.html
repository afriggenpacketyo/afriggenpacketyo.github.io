The group, which includes members from Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Texas, had claimed they were reclaiming land stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago and gained a significant online following. The eviction was streamed live on TikTok, showing a man and woman being led away by officers. Following the removal of the individuals, council officials began dismantling the camp.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has entered its second day of a shutdown due to a congressional impasse over spending bills. The Trump administration has blamed Democrats for the closure, while Democrats insist Republicans must negotiate. In response to the shutdown, President Trump has called for cutting "dead wood, waste, and fraud" from the federal government, with the White House Office of Management and Budget warning Republican lawmakers that mass layoffs of federal workers are imminent. The administration also announced the cancellation of $8 billion in funding for energy programs it claims support a "climate agenda."</p>

The multi-story building collapsed on Monday while students were gathered for afternoon prayers, leaving nearly 60 teenage students missing. To date, five students have been rescued and five deaths have been confirmed. Officials consulted with the families of the missing before deciding to bring in heavy equipment to carefully remove the debris.</p>

          <p>PIMCO President Christian Stracke has highlighted growing risks in the corporate direct lending market, noting an increase in borrowers asking to defer cash interest payments. He contrasted this with the healthier state of asset-based financing, such as mortgages and consumer loans, where household balance sheets are stronger. Stracke explained that corporate borrowers face a trade-off between private debt, which offers easier renegotiation at a higher cost, and more liquid public debt, which is cheaper but harder to refinance. He anticipates more opportunities in mortgage-related credit as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a Category 1 storm after hitting Bermuda with heavy rain and powerful winds. The storm is now moving further into the Atlantic and is expected to weaken into an extratropical cyclone. While a hurricane warning for the island has been lifted, a tropical storm warning remains in effect. There have been no immediate reports of significant damage, but swells generated by Imelda are causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of university faculty are integrating generative AI tools like Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude into their work, according to new research. Professors are using these AI models for a variety of tasks, including brainstorming course materials, developing grading rubrics, conducting research, and writing grant proposals. A study by Anthropic found that 57% of conversations with its AI by higher education users related to curriculum development. While AI saves significant time on administrative tasks, some academics express concern over its use for grading student work, fearing it could devalue the educational process.</p>

          <p>Berlin is set to crack down on its popular "zu verschenken" or "to gift" tradition, where residents leave unwanted items on the street for others to take. Citing the high cost of cleaning up leftover items, which amounted to over €10 million last year, the city will introduce hefty fines for the practice. Penalties could range from €150 for clothes to as high as €15,000 for large appliances. While officials argue the tradition has led to excessive dumping, sustainability advocates fear the new policy is short-sighted and may lead to more usable goods being thrown away.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances. The plan, which would not require taxpayer funding, aims to turn around the company, which has faced severe criticism for sewage discharges and leaks. Investors stated that no dividends would be paid during the turnaround, and they would commit to not selling the business before March 2030.</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led protests, largely organized by 'Generation Z' on social media, is challenging governments across Africa. In Madagascar, demonstrations over water and electricity shortages led the president to dissolve his government. Similar movements have emerged in Kenya against a finance bill, in Togo over constitutional changes, and in Morocco, where large rallies are protesting government spending priorities ahead of the 2030 World Cup. Analysts attribute the unrest to widespread frustration over poor governance, deteriorating economic conditions, and the effective use of technology by a younger, digitally-native generation.</p>

          <p>Recent NFL rule changes have revitalized the importance of the kicking game, leading to more dynamic and impactful special teams plays. A new kickoff formation has dramatically increased returns, with teams averaging over 100 return yards per game, compared to just 25 last year. Meanwhile, kickers are demonstrating unprecedented range, with Tampa Bay's Chase McLaughlin successfully hitting a 65-yard field goal. This has led defensive coordinators like Philadelphia's Vic Fangio to predict a 70-plus-yard field goal is imminent, attributing the increased power to teams using specially prepared 'K' balls.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the world's most powerful storms this year, Super Typhoon Ragasa resulted in zero fatalities when it made landfall in mainland China, a stark contrast to previous deadly typhoons. The successful outcome is attributed to extensive preparations, particularly in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen. Authorities evacuated over one million people across Guangdong province, deployed more than 38,000 rescue personnel, and opened hundreds of temporary shelters. This proactive approach highlights significant improvements in China's disaster response capabilities since past events like the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.</p>

          <p>China's State Council has issued new guidelines clarifying the definition of "domestically made products" for government procurement, aiming to create a more predictable environment for foreign companies. Effective January 1, goods qualifying as "Made in China" will receive a 20% price preference in government contract bidding. The policy will apply equally to state-owned, private, and foreign-invested firms, provided their products meet a set threshold for the proportion of domestically produced components.

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency after its infant mortality rate reached its highest level in over a decade, with nearly 10 babies dying for every 1,000 live births. Health experts attribute the crisis to a lack of prenatal care, as many women lack health insurance and more than half of the state's counties are considered maternity care deserts. Advocates warn that the situation could worsen and spread to other states as millions are expected to lose Medicaid coverage due to federal spending cuts. They argue that expanding access to healthcare before pregnancy is crucial for preventing preterm births and saving lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waking up with a sore back or stiff neck can often be attributed to improper sleep posture, which creates gaps between the body and the mattress, causing muscle tension. Medical experts recommend sleeping in a position that maintains the natural curvature of the spine, similar to a standing posture. This involves keeping the head, shoulders, and hips aligned. For side and stomach sleepers, using extra pillows to support gaps under the knees or between the hips can help, while back sleepers may benefit from a pillow under the small of their back to prevent strain.</p>

          <p>With another government shutdown underway, the nation's air travel system faces potential disruptions due to the financial strain on unpaid air traffic controllers. During the 2019 shutdown, a slight increase in sick calls from controllers at just two facilities caused chaos at major East Coast airports, a factor believed to have pressured lawmakers to end the 35-day standoff. Morale among controllers is reportedly lower now due to worsening staff shortages and stagnant pay, raising concerns that individual controllers may again call in sick, leading to significant flight delays and increasing pressure on Washington to resolve the impasse.</p>

          <p>Nationwide anti-government protests in Morocco have turned deadly, with police shooting and killing two people in the southern town of Leqliaa. Authorities claimed the officers acted in self-defense after the individuals allegedly tried to seize their weapons. The demonstrations, organized by a youth-led movement known as "Gen Z protests," have spread across the country, fueled by anger over corruption and government spending on World Cup preparations while public services like schools and hospitals are neglected. The protests have escalated, with reports of demonstrators torching cars and looting shops in several cities.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has apologized to Londoners after a BBC Panorama investigation exposed appalling behavior by serving officers. Undercover footage showed officers making racist and misogynistic comments, calling for immigrants to be shot, and being dismissive of sexual assault claims. In a letter to the home secretary, Sir Mark called the behavior reprehensible and stated that officers with incontrovertible evidence against them would face fast-track dismissal hearings. He detailed immediate actions, including dismantling and replacing the entire custody team at the Charing Cross station where the filming took place.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has issued a formal apology for the widespread fraud and human rights abuses that occurred within the country's past foreign adoption programs. The apology follows a landmark report from a truth commission which found the government responsible for allowing agencies to falsify records and, in some cases, remove children from their birth families to reduce welfare costs, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. President Lee offered his "heartfelt apology and words of comfort" to adoptees and their families, acknowledging the government's failure to prevent the abuses.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed concerns that his crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, presents a conflict of interest with the Trump administration. Speaking at a conference in Singapore, he called the idea that investors might use the venture to seek political favor "complete nonsense." The company, co-founded by Trump Jr. and the son of a Trump-appointed envoy, launched a stablecoin called USD1 and has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers. Trump Jr. emphasized that the firm is not a political organization, despite a Trump-affiliated entity receiving a major share of its revenue.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning significant changes to its asylum system, which will require refugees to wait longer than the current five years before they can apply for permanent settlement. Additionally, the route that allows refugees to automatically bring close family members to the UK will be permanently scrapped. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that settlement will no longer be a "golden ticket" and must be earned by contributing to the country. The new conditions are expected to include learning English to a high standard and having a clean criminal record.</p>

          <p>Dozens of hand-sewn American flags intended for President Donald Trump's recent state visit to the UK had to be replaced at an estimated cost of £52,800. A government supplier claimed that the U.S. embassy objected to the standard shade of red used on the flags, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. The switch meant that 66 flags used along The Mall in London and at Windsor Castle had to be remade. The supplier speculated that a sample flag shown to the embassy may have faded slightly from previous use, leading to the costly correction.</p>

In contrast, several smaller EV competitors, including Leapmotor, Xpeng, and Nio, all reported record-high monthly deliveries.
