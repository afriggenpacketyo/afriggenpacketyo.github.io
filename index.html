        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. The decision came shortly after former President Donald Trump criticized him for opposing a major spending and tax bill and threatened to support a primary challenger against him. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, suggesting the political environment has become too polarized. His retirement opens up a competitive Senate seat in a key state that has trended Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>Two tropical storms, Barry and Flossie, formed on Sunday off both of Mexico's coasts, prompting weather warnings and expectations of heavy rainfall in the region for several days. Tropical Storm Barry, located on the Atlantic side, is forecast to strengthen slightly before making landfall in southeastern Mexico, bringing significant rain. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Flossie has formed in the Pacific and is expected to intensify into a hurricane early in the week, though it is projected to remain offshore. Authorities have issued warnings as both storms pose a risk of flooding and drenching rains across multiple Mexican states.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled to limit the authority of federal district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision celebrated by the Trump administration. The ruling addresses the frequent use of such injunctions by a small number of liberal-leaning courts to block the administration's policies on a national scale. Attorney General Pam Bondi noted that of 40 universal injunctions against the current administration, 35 originated from just five federal districts. This decision curtails a legal strategy that conservatives argue was used to obstruct a democratically elected president's agenda through judicial overreach, restoring some executive authority.</p>

          <p>According to a Financial Times report, insiders at AI chip manufacturer Nvidia have sold over $1 billion worth of company stock in the past year, with half of those sales occurring in the last month. The sell-off coincides with the stock reaching new highs, having risen over 17% this year despite concerns about international sales restrictions. CEO Jensen Huang recently sold approximately $15 million in shares as part of a larger plan to sell up to 6 million shares by year's end. This activity comes as Nvidia briefly regained its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA Commissioner, expressed concerns about the politicization of public health under the current Trump administration. He criticized the reconstitution of the vaccine advisory committee (ACIP) with members who may have ideological biases, a move that led the American Academy of Pediatrics to declare the process no longer credible. Gottlieb warned that these policies, championed by Secretary Kennedy, could restrict access to vital vaccines beyond just COVID-19. He also addressed the removal of CDC information debunking links between the preservative thimerosal and autism, highlighting a departure from evidence-based public health practices.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has threatened to cut federal funding to New York City if democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani wins the mayoral election and "doesn't behave himself." Trump referred to Mamdani as a "pure communist," a label Mamdani denied, stating his political inspiration is Martin Luther King Jr. Mamdani reaffirmed his platform to raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers to address inequality, remarking, "I donâ€™t think that we should have billionaires." The candidate is now navigating a complex political landscape, facing opposition from Trump while seeking to unite a divided Democratic party.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Atlanta are warning drivers about a scam involving teens known as "water boys" who sell bottled water at intersections. Some sellers are allegedly exploiting digital payment methods like Cash App to steal large sums of money from unsuspecting customers. In one reported case, a woman who intended to pay $2 for water was charged $1,100 after handing her phone to a seller. Other incidents involve QR codes leading to unauthorized withdrawals and even armed robbery. Experts advise against handing over phones, scanning unknown QR codes, and suggest using cash or enabling transaction verification for all digital payments.</p>

          <p>India's annual monsoon rains have covered the entire country nine days ahead of the typical schedule, according to the national weather department. The early arrival of the monsoon, which provides nearly 70% of the country's rainfall, is crucial for accelerating the planting of summer crops like rice, corn, and soybeans. The monsoon is the lifeblood of India's agricultural sector and its nearly $4 trillion economy, as almost half of the nation's farmland is rain-fed. So far this month, rainfall has been 8% above average, with forecasts predicting an above-average season for the second consecutive year.</p>

Despite being an outspoken critic of Israel, Mamdani gained strong support, indicating that a pro-Palestinian stance is no longer a disqualifier in a city with the largest Jewish population outside Israel. His success reflects a growing disillusionment, particularly among younger and more progressive Jews, with Israel's current government and its conduct in the war in Gaza. While some in the community express alarm, others see it as a rejection of weaponizing the issue of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take precautions to prevent heat-related illness, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise than from being left in hot cars, as they cannot regulate their body temperature effectively. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. Experts advise against walking dogs in hot weather, suggesting instead to check pavement temperature and provide indoor playtime. If a dog shows signs of distress, it should be cooled with water immediately and taken to a vet.</p>

In a television interview, Grossi explained that while the attacks caused severe damage, it was not total, and Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild its program. This assessment contrasts with the Trump administration's claims that the facilities were "totally obliterated." Grossi emphasized the need for diplomacy and for international inspectors to regain access to monitor Iran's nuclear activities and clarify the status of its enriched uranium stockpile.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham expressed that it is "too early to tell" if U.S. strikes have deterred Iran's nuclear ambitions, stating his belief that the regime still desires to build a weapon. While acknowledging the military operation successfully set back Iran's program, he argued that Tehran's fundamental goal to threaten Israel and the U.S. has not changed. Graham suggested that before any diplomatic talks, Iran must first publicly recognize Israel's right to exist. He also mentioned that former President Trump now supports his bill to impose tariffs on nations that purchase Russian oil.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has refrained from endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, citing a need to know him better. While congratulating Mamdani on his successful campaign, Jeffries stated they have never had a substantive conversation and plans to meet with him to discuss his vision for the city. Jeffries emphasized that Mamdani will need to clarify his positions on Israel and antisemitism, calling the phrase "Globalizing the Intifada" unacceptable. He also expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's claims regarding the recent U.S. strikes on Iran.</p>
