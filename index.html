        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly alters the federal student loan system, consolidating repayment options and introducing new borrowing caps. The legislation reduces the number of repayment plans to two: a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven plan. It also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants and imposes new limits on Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans, which has raised concerns from medical colleges about financial barriers for students. While some experts see the simplification as an improvement, others worry about extended repayment timelines for borrowers.</p>

          <p>In a London murder trial, Yostin Mosquera, accused of killing and dismembering a couple, testified that one of the victims, Albert Alfonso, had threatened his family. Mosquera claims he was coerced into performing sexual acts against his will and felt trapped in the couple's home. He alleges that Mr. Alfonso was responsible for the death of his partner, Paul Longworth, and that he only killed Mr. Alfonso in an act of self-control. The prosecution contends that Mosquera murdered both men before attempting to dispose of their bodies in Bristol.</p>

          <p>Timothy Leiweke, a high-profile sports executive and CEO of Oak View Group (OVG), has been criminally charged for allegedly orchestrating a bid-rigging scheme. A federal grand jury indicted Leiweke for conspiring with a competitor to ensure OVG won the contract to build the $388 million Moody Center at the University of Texas. The Justice Department alleges the scheme deprived the university and taxpayers of a competitive bidding process. Leiweke, who has since resigned as CEO, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old physical therapist, Dr. Walter Foxcroft, died after a flash fire occurred inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber at his medical facility in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Firefighters responded to a report of a fire and found Foxcroft deceased inside the machine. A hyperbaric chamber is a pressurized tube used for various medical treatments, and it is unclear why the therapist was inside it at the time. This incident marks at least the second fatal event involving a hyperbaric chamber in the U.S. this year.</p>

          <p>The National Trust, a major UK heritage charity, has announced plans to eliminate approximately 550 jobs, representing 6% of its workforce.

The cuts are part of a broader strategy to achieve £26 million in savings. The Prospect union, which represents staff, acknowledged the cost pressures but argued that management decisions also contributed to the financial difficulties.</p>

          <p>Despite the widespread struggle for accessible and affordable childcare in the U.S., a powerful mass movement demanding systemic change has failed to materialize. The article explores the historical, cultural, and political reasons for this, from a 1970s presidential veto of a national childcare bill to a persistent ideology viewing childcare as a private family matter. While new parent-led organizing efforts have emerged post-pandemic, the movement still lacks the political salience and shared vision seen in other countries that have successfully reformed their childcare systems.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. continues to threaten trade partners with tariffs, analysts suggest Beijing is shifting to a more pragmatic approach to counter American protectionism. China is reportedly focusing on strengthening ties with its own trade partners by offering development opportunities and fostering regional integration. This strategy is seen as a way to build a more unified regional market and collectively push back against Washington's policies. The approach emphasizes creating tangible benefits for neighboring countries rather than relying solely on strongly worded diplomatic warnings.</p>
