They are tasked with reaching a verdict on serious charges including racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution, all of which Combs has steadfastly denied. The jury, which has selected a foreperson, has been provided with all necessary materials, including trial transcripts and evidence, to aid their decision-making process.

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted of the 1967 sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne, solving one of the United Kingdom's longest-running cold cases. Dunne was found strangled in her home, and the case remained unsolved for 58 years despite extensive police efforts at the time. The breakthrough came in 2023 when preserved evidence from the victim's clothing was re-examined using modern forensic technology, yielding a DNA match to Headley. The conviction brings a long-awaited resolution to Dunne's family, and authorities are now investigating if Headley is linked to other unsolved crimes.</p>

          <p>The Ipswich-based punk-rap duo Bob Vylan has come under intense scrutiny following a controversial performance at the Glastonbury Festival. Frontman Bobby Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, led a chant of "death to the IDF," prompting condemnation from festival organizers, the prime minister, and the BBC. Formed in 2017, the band is known for its politically charged lyrics tackling racism, police violence, and capitalism, blending punk rock with UK grime influences. This article explores the band's background, their rise in the music scene, and the provocative, cathartic nature of their highly politicized performances that have now sparked a police investigation.</p>

The extreme heat, caused by a persistent high-pressure "heat dome," has prompted red alerts and health warnings in Spain, Portugal, and France. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the extreme heat as the "new normal" driven by climate change. The heat is moving northward, with Germany and the UK also bracing for scorching temperatures, affecting events like the Wimbledon tennis tournament.

The legislation seeks to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase border security and defense spending, and is offset by cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Key provisions include imposing work requirements for Medicaid, raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, and increasing the child tax credit to $2,200. The bill also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, as the Senate works through amendments to finalize the package. (not investment advice)</p>

The facility, located at a remote airport, was rapidly converted to hold up to 5,000 detainees and is expected to be operational this week. DeSantis promoted the center as an effective tool to aid federal deportation efforts, emphasizing its remote and secure location by noting the difficulty of reaching civilization from there.

Democrats are forcing votes on contentious issues like Medicaid cuts, while some Republicans are using the process to register opposition to specific parts of the bill they ultimately plan to support.

          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector experienced a significant drop following revelations that President Trump's proposed spending bill contains unfavorable provisions for the industry. The current Senate draft includes a new tax on wind and solar projects that use Chinese components and also abruptly phases out crucial investment and production tax credits for projects placed in service after 2027. This change compresses project timelines and creates significant execution risk for developers. Major renewable energy stocks like NextEra Energy, Array Technologies, and Enphase saw their shares fall, while some rooftop solar companies were viewed as relative winners.

The report highlights that victims are often forced to act as their own detectives, gathering extensive evidence themselves due to inadequate police response. Survivors described their experiences as traumatic, with police misplacing evidence and failing to grasp the pattern of intimidation. The findings, which show some forces log three times more offenses than others, have prompted calls for radical change and better training to protect victims of this insidious form of domestic abuse.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced that a key satellite program used for weather forecasting will be discontinued by July 31, just as the U.S. enters the peak of hurricane season. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, operated by the Department of Defense, has provided crucial environmental data for decades. The decision to stop processing and distributing this data to weather scientists was made by a naval branch to mitigate a cybersecurity risk. This cutoff comes as NOAA is already facing resource challenges, raising concerns about its impact on the accuracy of hurricane forecasting during its most active period.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Advise on Choosing Between CDs and Stocks for Savings and Investment</h2>

          <p>With interest rates on savings products like certificates of deposit (CDs) beginning to decline from recent highs, savers are weighing their options. Financial experts advise that the choice between opening a CD and investing in the stock market depends heavily on individual financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. CDs offer a guaranteed, safe return, making them suitable for short-term goals where capital preservation is key. In contrast, the stock market offers higher potential returns over the long term but comes with significantly more risk and volatility, making it better for goals like retirement that are decades away.
