          <p>Moderna has revised its full-year revenue forecast downward, citing a delay in Covid-19 vaccine shipments to the United Kingdom, which will now occur in early 2026. Despite the lowered outlook, the biotech company surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for both revenue and loss per share. This financial performance comes as Moderna implements significant cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions, to navigate the decline in Covid vaccine sales and focus on bringing new products to the market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation targeting the precious metals and gems sector to close a significant loophole exploited by criminals. The rule mandates that dealers report any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (US$13,870) to the national financial crime watchdog within five days. This marks China's first major expansion of such compliance requirements beyond traditional financial institutions, signaling a more robust approach to combating illicit financial activities across different sectors of the economy.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates a significant drop in Gen Z's approval of President Trump, but this discontent has not translated into a definitive shift toward the Democratic Party. While young voters today are more evenly split between parties compared to previous years, they also exhibit higher levels of political pessimism and disengagement. This trend suggests that Gen Z voters are not firmly aligned with either party, creating an unpredictable political dynamic and a challenge for both Republicans and Democrats looking to secure their support.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that a persistent pattern of criticism and condescension towards men from progressive cultural voices is a significant factor in driving male voters toward Donald Trump. The author argues that many young men feel alienated and attacked by a Democratic party they perceive as "anti-male," leading them to check out of mainstream discourse and embrace rebellious political choices. The article suggests that until the left changes its tone, it will continue to lose a crucial demographic.</p>

          <p>Despite a long-standing California law banning the sale of foie gras, the product, which is made by force-feeding ducks or geese, was recently discovered on the shelves of several Wild Fork Foods stores in Southern California. The sale violates the state ban, which has been repeatedly upheld in court against legal challenges. After being contacted by journalists for comment, the stores removed the product, but the incident raises questions about the enforcement of the animal welfare law.</p>

          <p>A last-minute amendment to a housing bill in California has resulted in a significant change to the state's HOA laws, capping most violation fines at $100 unless a direct health or safety impact is proven. This new rule is a major victory for homeowners who have long argued that homeowners associations are often overbearing and aggressive with their penalties. The HOA industry was caught by surprise and expressed concern that the new cap will undermine their ability to effectively enforce community rules.</p>

          <p>The Southern California community of Sierra Madre has seen a dramatic increase in bears breaking into homes, a problem that locals believe has been worsened by the recent Eaton fire destroying the animals' natural habitat. The surge in incidents has heightened tensions between residents and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife over how to manage the situation, which was further complicated by state budget cuts that eliminated local human-wildlife conflict specialists. The conflict has prompted discussions among local leaders about pooling resources to address the public safety threat.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, the author sharply criticizes the Los Angeles Dodgers' front office for its failure to make significant acquisitions at the MLB trade deadline. While key rivals strengthened their rosters, the Dodgers, who have urgent needs for a reliable closer and a defensive outfielder, remained largely passive. The author argues this inaction is a departure from the team's typically aggressive midseason strategy and could be perceived as an arrogant misstep that endangers their World Series aspirations.</p>

However, records show the safety regulation was significantly weakened after intense opposition from Edison and other utilities, which ultimately allowed the companies to decide when a line was "permanently abandoned." A former regulator who worked on the original proposal stated that the devastating fire "could have been prevented" had the stricter rule been enacted.</p>
