          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. will possess a "golden share" in U.S. Steel following its acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel, asserting that this share would grant the U.S. control over the company. However, the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear, as neither the White House, U.S. Steel, nor Nippon have provided detailed information on the deal's structure or timeline. The United Steelworkers union has also expressed concerns, demanding clarity on whether the proposed partnership significantly differs from Nippon's initial plan to acquire U.S. Steel as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Trump mentioned that he has yet to approve the final deal with Nippon, leaving the details of the agreement uncertain. Optimism score is assigned based on the potential for U.S. control over a key industry. </p>

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the charge of third-degree sexual assault against Jessica Mann after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict. This decision followed a partial verdict where Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola. The jury foreperson cited feeling threatened by another juror, leading to security measures and ultimately contributing to the mistrial. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced his office's intention to retry the rape charge, emphasizing the power imbalance and misconceptions surrounding sexual assault.

Washington D.C. follows New Hampshire with an average tip of 12.65%, while Utah residents tip the least at 4.09%.

Long's nomination, backed by President Donald Trump, received mixed support and faced Democratic scrutiny during the confirmation process. Long stated that the IRS would not be politicized under his leadership and that he would follow the law. The implications of Long's appointment for taxpayers remain uncertain. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and urging him to lower interest rates. Trump claimed that a 2 percentage point rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion per year. He also stated that he might have to "force something" if the Fed doesn't lower rates, despite low inflation. Trump's attack on Powell is the latest in a series of criticisms from his administration directed at the central bank leader. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's charitable foundation has experienced substantial growth, increasing from $828 million to over $9.1 billion in assets over the past five years due to Nvidia stock donations. This growth has positioned the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation as one of the largest private foundations in the U.S. The foundation is now required to distribute a significant amount annually, estimated at $369 million this year. While the Huangs have made some public gifts, the majority of the foundation's disbursements go to donor-advised funds. </p>

          <p>A Vox reporter argues that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the new leader of the US Department of Health and Human Services, should ban ractopamine hydrochloride. Ractopamine is a drug fed to pigs to speed up muscle gain, but it has been linked to severe adverse events in pigs and raises environmental and human health concerns. While many countries have banned or restricted ractopamine, the FDA has denied petitions to ban the drug, arguing that current regulations ensure consumer safety. The writer contends that banning ractopamine would align with Kennedy's past criticisms of factory farming and animal cruelty. </p>

          <p>The dollar experienced a significant decline, reaching its lowest level in over three years, while the FTSE 100 achieved a record high.

The dollar was sold in favor of the yen and the euro, while investors sought alternatives to U.S. company shares. The UK is expected to get a trade boost after Trump indicated that he would put into force the bilateral trade deal signed with Keir Starmer last month. (not investment advice)</p>
