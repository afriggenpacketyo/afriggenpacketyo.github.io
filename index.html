          <p>This article commemorates the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X's birth, highlighting his advocacy for Black civil rights and his critique of American society. Born into poverty and violence, Malcolm X rose to prominence as a spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, advocating for Black self-reliance and resistance against racial oppression 'by any means necessary'. The article details his disillusionment with white liberals and his eventual shift towards collaboration with the broader civil rights movement after a transformative pilgrimage to Mecca.

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Christine Emba critiques the normalization of pornography and its impact on society, particularly on Gen Z. The article references a British OnlyFans creator who garnered attention for sleeping with 100 men in one day, using this as an example of how normalized pornographic extremes have become. Emba argues that the ready availability of pornography, often violent and dehumanizing, has contributed to young women's distrust of men and has warped cultural norms. She criticizes the reluctance in progressive circles to publicly disapprove of porn, urging a more critical examination of its effects on society.</p>

          <p>A sweeping US tax and spending bill, dubbed Trump's 'mega-bill,' has moved one step closer to a full vote in the House after overcoming Republican conflict. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term, end taxes on tips, and increase military and border spending. However, the bill faces opposition from both hard-line conservatives and moderates, raising concerns about its potential impact on the national debt. Despite these challenges, House Speaker Mike Johnson expects the bill to advance to a floor vote later in the week.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in the trade war between China and the United States, tensions have resurfaced following a US ban on Huawei Technologies' Ascend AI chips. The US cited national security concerns and alleged export control violations as reasons for the ban. Beijing has accused Washington of 'maliciously blockading and suppressing Chinese chip products and the AI industry without justification'. This action signals that the US is looking to expand the battleground beyond tariffs and tighten tech restrictions on China, while China is actively countering US restrictions with its own export controls and self-reliance measures.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that Israel will take control of the entire Gaza Strip, escalating its military offensive in the territory. Netanyahu stated that the aim is to have an area entirely controlled by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) where the entire civilian population of Gaza could receive aid, with Hamas receiving nothing. This declaration comes as Gaza's Hamas-controlled Health Ministry reports a significant increase in casualties since Israel resumed its strikes. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization by many countries, including the United States, Israel and Germany.</p>

The downgrade highlighted worries about the cost of President Trump’s policies and the health of the economy. Moody's cited the tax cut legislation and broader concerns about the fiscal deficit and growing debt costs as reasons for the downgrade. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, noted that the Moody’s downgrade would “have implications for the cost of capital and a bunch of other things”.</p>
