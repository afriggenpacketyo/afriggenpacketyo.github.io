          <p>Mohammed Zahid, the 65-year-old ringleader of a grooming gang in Rochdale, has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for sexually assaulting two schoolgirls. Known as 'Boss Man,' Zahid and six other men were convicted of numerous sexual offenses that occurred between 2001 and 2006. The court heard that the men exploited the vulnerable girls, who had troubled home lives, by plying them with drugs and alcohol in exchange for sex. This case highlighted past failings by social services and police, who have since apologized for not intervening sooner.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against real estate companies Zillow and Redfin, alleging they violated federal antitrust laws. The complaint centers on a $100 million deal where Zillow paid Redfin to host its multifamily rental listings, effectively eliminating Redfin as an independent competitor in the market. The FTC claims this arrangement reduced competition and made Redfin's rental listings virtually identical to Zillow's. Both companies have disputed the allegations, stating their partnership is pro-consumer and beneficial for renters and property managers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigative report by DW suggests that Volkswagen's electric vehicle supply chain likely includes 'conflict minerals' sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. The investigation identified at least six smelters linked to conflict financing that appear on VW's own supplier list. These minerals, including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, are essential for EV manufacturing. Volkswagen responded that it has no direct relationship with the smelters and cited the complexity of global supply chains, highlighting a broader issue of transparency in the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to several U.S. cities has sparked legal challenges and a sharp partisan divide. Democratic governors in states like California and Oregon have opposed the deployments, with some filing lawsuits arguing they violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic military law enforcement. In contrast, Republican governors in states like Louisiana have welcomed the federal assistance to address crime. This pattern highlights growing tensions over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has officially shut down after Congress failed to pass a spending bill before the deadline. The stalemate occurred as Democrats and Republicans could not agree on key issues, including the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and funding for Medicaid. As a result, millions of federal employees will go without pay, and non-essential government services will be suspended. The shutdown marks the 21st such funding gap since 1977 and creates significant economic uncertainty for workers and federal contractors.</p>

          <p>A decision by Florida's government to donate prime Miami real estate for Donald Trump's presidential library has drawn sharp criticism from immigrant advocates and community leaders. The land is located next to the historic Freedom Tower, a symbol of hope for Cuban refugees, which critics argue makes it an inappropriate site for a monument to a president known for harsh immigration policies. The deal, facilitated by Governor Ron DeSantis, has been condemned as a betrayal of the city's history as a welcoming place for immigrants.</p>

The plan vaguely mentions a pathway to a Palestinian state, an idea Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly resisted immediately after endorsing the overall deal.

          <p>In an unprecedented gathering, President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed hundreds of the military's top commanders, delivering speeches that analysts have described as an informal loyalty test. The remarks focused on instilling a "warrior ethos" and suggested using the military to police "dangerous" U.S. cities. Both Trump and Hegseth explicitly stated that any commanders who disagreed with their vision should resign, raising concerns about the politicization of the military and its traditional apolitical stance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to begin a new term that will feature several high-stakes cases, including major challenges to the scope of presidential power. The justices will hear arguments on whether President Trump has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs and to fire the heads of independent federal agencies. Another landmark case, Louisiana vs. Callais, will decide the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a ruling that could have sweeping consequences for all civil rights laws that prohibit discriminatory impact.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced he is prepared to declare a state of emergency, citing what he calls the threat of U.S. "aggression." The declaration follows recent deadly U.S. military strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration has significantly increased its naval presence in the region as part of a counternarcotics operation, which is widely seen as a measure to increase pressure on the Maduro regime, escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has announced its intention to pass a new law that will permanently ban fracking for shale gas in England. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that he would legislate at the earliest opportunity to end the controversial practice, which is currently paused under a moratorium. The move sets up a clear policy clash with the Reform UK party, which has advocated for restarting fracking and has criticized investments in renewable energy.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is a misguided policy that will severely damage U.S. innovation and economic growth. The authors, who are immigrant university professors, contend that highly skilled foreign workers are vital to the nation's tech industry and startup ecosystem. They suggest that instead of creating prohibitive financial barriers, the U.S. should expand the H-1B program and distribute these workers more widely to foster economic prosperity throughout the country.</p>
