          <p>President Trump met with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, at the White House, discussing trade and North Korea. Trump touted his "great relationship" with Kim Jong-un and expressed a desire for a future meeting, aiming for progress on the Korean Peninsula. Despite earlier social media posts from Trump suggesting turmoil in South Korea, he adopted a softer tone during the meeting, while both leaders also addressed ongoing trade negotiations. The article highlights the complex diplomatic landscape between the U.S., South Korea, and North Korea.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of battery with injury to a police officer and one felony count of resisting arrest. The charges stem from an incident where police responded to reports of a partially naked man wandering the streets of Los Angeles, and the artist allegedly charged at officers. He was taken to the hospital for a possible overdose after the event. The article notes his bail was set at $75,000 and references his previous controversies and upcoming album.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police reported "far fewer" incidents of serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to previous years, despite 423 arrests over two days. There were two stabbings, neither resulting in serious injury, a notable reduction from the eight stabbings and two deaths last year. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this improvement to the use of live facial recognition, metal detectors, and stop-and-search operations. Civil liberty groups have criticized the reintroduction of facial recognition technology, citing concerns about mass surveillance and accuracy for women and people of color.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Chair James Comer, has issued a subpoena to Jeffrey Epstein's estate, demanding documents by September 8. The committee is investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein case, including the controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement. Requested documents include financial transactions, call logs, visitor logs, and any potential "client list" related to sex trafficking. This bipartisan probe follows renewed interest after the DOJ's previous declaration that no such client list existed, and will also involve testimony from former Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.</p>

Zambada, 77, expressed apology for the harm caused by illegal drugs in the U.S. and Mexico, taking responsibility for his actions. He is expected to be sentenced in January, facing a likely life imprisonment. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated this plea brings the U.S. closer to eliminating drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, recently appeared at their first parole hearings, both of which were denied. The brothers reiterated their claim that the murders were committed in self-defense after years of sexual assault by their father. Erik described fearing for his life and his father's impending sexual assault, while Lyle spoke of buying guns for "emotional protection" and feeling shock and regret after the killings. The parole board cited prison rule violations despite acknowledging their rehabilitation efforts.</p>

          <p>Netflix's "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved significant box office success with a two-day theatrical sing-along release, generating an estimated $16-20 million domestically.

The lawsuit targets a partnership allowing Apple customers to connect with OpenAI's ChatGPT on iPhones, claiming it hinders competition and maintains monopolies. Musk's companies seek a permanent injunction and over $1 billion in damages, escalating an ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

          <p>Following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks, markets are strongly anticipating a quarter percentage point interest rate cut in September, with an implied probability of 82%. However, certainty about subsequent cuts is much lower, with only a 33% expectation for three total moves this year. Market experts express caution, citing ongoing inflation concerns and a resilient economy despite labor market slowdowns. Skeptics, like Morgan Stanley, question the urgency and impact of cuts, warning of potential unintended consequences similar to last year's easing cycle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to punish flag burning, asserting it incites riots and demonstrates hostility. The order directs the Justice Department to prosecute "content-neutral laws" related to flag desecration, while also seeking to clarify First Amendment exceptions for acts likely to incite lawless action. It also targets foreign nationals engaged in such activity. However, the article highlights that Supreme Court decisions in 1989 and 1990 affirmed flag burning as protected speech under the First Amendment, making Trump's directive a challenge to established legal precedent.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the share of working Californians represented by unions has remained relatively steady over the last two decades, defying a national trend of declining union membership. In 2024, 16.3% of California's labor force, or 2.67 million workers, were union-represented. This stability is attributed to consistent new organizing efforts, particularly in the medical industry and at establishments like Starbucks. While some unions experienced declines due to automation or industry contractions, California's overall union density has held firm, showcasing active labor movements in the state.</p>
