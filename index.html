          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving a credible death threat. The threat was reportedly made online by a 26-year-old man in Ottawa, Canada, prior to a performance there, leading to his arrest and an ongoing police investigation. Out of caution for the safety of the artist and his band, venues in Boston, Massachusetts, and Mashantucket, Connecticut, announced the cancellations. Morrissey, the former frontman for The Smiths, has assured fans that all tickets will be refunded at the point of purchase.</p>

          <p>Defense lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the federal indictment that makes him eligible for the death penalty. They argue that prejudicial statements from public officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, have compromised his right to a fair trial. The defense claims the decision to seek capital punishment is based on political agendas rather than legal merit, citing a "torrent of prejudice." Meanwhile, a New York judge has already dismissed state-level terrorism charges against Mangione, though other murder charges remain.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "Softly, as I Leave You: Life After Elvis," Priscilla Presley shares her personal account of the day Elvis Presley died on August 16, 1977. She describes the frantic moments after learning the news, rushing to Graceland, and comforting their young daughter, Lisa Marie, who had seen her father's body. The memoir details the surreal atmosphere of the internationally televised funeral and the profound, disorienting grief that followed. Presley reflects on how his death changed everything, leaving her to raise a brokenhearted child in a world without him.</p>

          <p>A new study from China reveals the development of an advanced artificial intelligence system reportedly capable of detecting stealth submarines with 95% accuracy in simulations. The system integrates data from various sources like sonar buoys and water temperature to create a real-time underwater map, potentially challenging existing naval defense strategies. While some Western military experts express skepticism about its immediate operational effectiveness, the technology highlights a potential shift in the global underwater power balance. The development could undermine the "nuclear triad" of deterrence, which relies on the stealth of submarine-launched ballistic missiles.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is risking his career by refusing to apologize for comments linking the alleged murderer of Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The author compares Kimmel's current situation to that of former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, who alienated a large portion of his audience with relentless political commentary and ultimately faded into obscurity. The piece suggests Kimmel's anti-Trump obsession has turned his comedy show into a one-note platform, and that a simple apology could salvage his job and help bridge national divides.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after a highly unusual qualifying session that was interrupted by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, saw multiple drivers crash, including championship contender Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, in challenging, lightly rainy conditions. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, with Liam Lawson of Racing Bulls in a surprising third. The numerous stoppages and changing weather created an unpredictable and dramatic shootout for the top spot on the starting grid.</p>

He successfully rescued three soldiers before being mortally wounded, with the remaining two being saved later.

Critics warn this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, using a tragedy as a pretext to crush dissent and crack down on civil liberties by labeling groups as domestic terrorists. Despite no evidence linking broader organizations to the killing, administration officials have vowed to "uproot and dismantle" networks they blame for fomenting violence.

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has suggested using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to address the country's asylum application backlog. The plan involves setting up temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to speed up decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued that invoking these emergency powers is necessary to secure the funds and resources for a rapid and decisive response. The proposal is part of the party's broader focus on law and order.</p>

          <p>Police in Sacramento have arrested a 64-year-old man suspected of firing multiple shots into the lobby of the ABC10 television station. The incident occurred a day after protesters had gathered outside the building to demonstrate against ABC's suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. While a motive is still under investigation, authorities linked the suspect to the vehicle used in the shooting and made the arrest with assistance from the FBI. No one was injured in the attack, but it has heightened concerns about violence directed at media organizations amid a politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>In the wake of his killing, right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is being positioned as a martyr by Christian nationalists in the U.S., a movement that grew alongside his own political rise. Religious and political allies are using his death as a "battle cry," suggesting it will ignite and embolden their cause against what they describe as evil and demonic forces on the left. This framing taps into a "holy war" narrative, leveraging the tragedy to galvanize support and advance a political agenda. Kirk's own career evolution mirrored the movement's shift from secular conservatism to a more strident, faith-based culture war.</p>

          <p>Several appliance brands, including Haier, Hisense, and Xiaomi, are introducing a new washing machine design featuring three separate drums to allow for multiple, simultaneous laundry cycles. This innovation aims to solve the common problem of having to run numerous consecutive loads for different types of clothing, such as colors, delicates, or baby clothes. The design typically includes one large central drum and two smaller drums above it, enabling users to wash different items with different settings at the same time. While not yet widely available, these machines signal a potential future for more efficient home laundry.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the attacks deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure, including a direct missile hit on a residential building in Dnipro, as part of a strategy to intimidate the populace. In response, Ukraine launched its own drone strikes, reportedly hitting two major Russian oil refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that it intercepted the majority of the 619 drones and missiles launched by Russia.</p>

The highly anticipated move boosted investor confidence and propelled major indices upward.

Lewinsky discussed how younger generations have re-evaluated her story with a better understanding of power dynamics, and how the #MeToo movement provided a new context for her experiences.

Beijing has long criticized the "public hype" around these operations.

          <p>A leading dermatologist is highlighting the often-overlooked risk of sun exposure while indoors, explaining that harmful UVA rays can penetrate window glass. While UVB rays, which cause sunburn, are mostly filtered by windows, UVA rays are not and can contribute to accelerated skin aging and skin cancer. This "silent" exposure can occur without any visible sign like a burn, making it particularly insidious. To stay protected, it is recommended to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, which shields against both UVA and UVB rays.</p>

This deal allows the UK to return a migrant who crosses the channel in exchange for accepting one with a strong asylum case from France.
