            <p>Individuals impacted by the opioid crisis are receiving minimal compensation from pharmaceutical settlements, often amounting to a few hundred dollars, while state and local governments are accumulating millions. This discrepancy has sparked outrage among victims and advocates, who argue that governments should prioritize addiction treatment, recovery, and prevention programs. Some jurisdictions have created small funds for affected individuals, but widespread cash payments remain elusive. The settlements aim to address the harm caused to public safety, health, and social service systems, but many believe governments are not adequately supporting those who have suffered the most.

            <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang, utilizing the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. While allowing the deportations, the court clarified that those facing removal under this law are entitled to judicial review in the district of confinement. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the administration's disregard for the rule of law. The decision comes amid tensions between the President and the judiciary over immigration policies, and the ACLU expressed disappointment but acknowledged a victory in requiring advance notice for those facing deportation.</p>

            <p>A trade group representing U.S. interests in Cambodia argues that President Trump's tariffs on Cambodian goods will not lead to reshoring manufacturing to the United States. While the 49% tariff rate will create challenges for Cambodian factories, manufacturers are instead looking to relocate their supply chains to other countries like Egypt, India, and Indonesia. Experts suggest that the uncertainty surrounding tariffs will likely pause executive decision-making regarding supply chain investments. The White House claims the return of manufacturing will generate revenue, but consultants doubt companies will return to the U.S. quickly.</p>

            <p>England's Health Secretary Wes Streeting has expressed concern about the impact of Birmingham's ongoing bin strike on public health, citing unsanitary conditions and vermin. The strike, now in its fifth week, has led to piles of rubbish accumulating on the streets, causing health risks and prompting a major incident declaration by the city council. Talks between bin workers and the city council have so far failed to reach an agreement, with workers striking over plans to remove roles and downgrade others. The council insists it needs to save money after declaring bankruptcy in 2023.</p>

            <p>American consumers are preparing for higher prices as President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to take effect. The reliance on Chinese manufacturing, particularly for electronics like iPhones, means that U.S. consumers will likely bear the cost of the tariffs. Although supply chains have diversified since 2018, China remains the primary source for many goods. The run on Apple stores reflects consumers' attempts to purchase products before the tariff-induced price increases.</p>

            <p>Newly discovered stone tools in southwestern China suggest that Neanderthals may have inhabited the region during the Middle Stone Age. The tools, similar to those found in Europe and the Middle East, are dated between 60,000 and 50,000 years old. The findings challenge the previous belief that early hominids in China were slow to adopt Middle Paleolithic advancements. The discovery could change the understanding of human evolution and the distribution of archaic human groups.</p>

            <p>President Trump has defended his sweeping tariffs, urging Americans to trust his policies and avoid being a "PANICAN". Trump claims the tariffs will bring jobs and manufacturing back to the U.S. However, a growing number of Republicans, Democrats, and foreign leaders are criticizing the trade policies. Critics argue that the tariffs could be economically catastrophic and will not result in massive reshoring of manufacturing. Billionaire Elon Musk has reportedly lobbied Trump to reverse the tariffs.</p>

They say the company has produced a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur.</p>
