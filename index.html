            <p>John Henry Anderson, a 19th-century Scottish magician, is credited as an inspiration to Harry Houdini, despite never meeting him, with Anderson known as "The Great Wizard of the North". Anderson, born in Aberdeenshire in 1814, was among the first magicians to pull a live rabbit out of a top hat and achieved worldwide fame. After Anderson's death, Houdini visited his grave in Aberdeen and funded its upkeep, showing respect for his predecessor. The Aberdeen Magical Society is planning events for its upcoming centenary, seeking historic magic artifacts to showcase the area's connection to the world of magic.</p>

Apple faces challenges including declining smartphone sales and potential tariff impacts due to its manufacturing in China, while also navigating consumer disappointment with its new AI features.

            <p>Alaska lawmakers are facing challenges in crafting the state budget due to market volatility caused by President Trump's tariffs and fluctuating oil prices, which are crucial for Alaska's revenue. The uncertainty is exacerbating long-standing tensions over the allocation of funds between the yearly oil-wealth fund dividend for residents and essential services like education. While some hope Trump's policies might boost gas investments, lawmakers are struggling to balance budget needs amidst unpredictable economic conditions. This situation highlights the state's reliance on oil revenue and the difficulties in managing finances amidst global economic shifts.</p>

            <p>President Trump's reversal on tariffs has caused confusion and uncertainty in the global market, leading economists to question his dealmaking abilities. The on-again, off-again approach to tariffs is seen as erratic and detrimental to long-term economic stability, with concerns raised about potential stagflation and a chilling effect on business investment. While some acknowledge the pause removes immediate supply chain chaos, the unpredictability of Trump's policies adds a permanent level of uncertainty to cross-border transactions. The trade war with China continues, with both countries imposing high tariffs on each other's exports.</p>

            <p>A popular Swedish eco-retreat, once celebrated for its sustainable living, has been embroiled in scandal after an investigation revealed the owners fled to Guatemala to avoid tax authorities, leaving behind environmental damage and unpaid debts.

However, reports of wastewater mismanagement and abandonment of animals have tarnished its image, raising questions about the authenticity of sustainable tourism in Scandinavia.

            <p>China's urban centers are grappling with the impacts of a declining population, affecting various sectors from business to local government revenues. Cities like Chengdu are managing to attract migrants, while others, particularly in the northeast, face economic gloom due to shrinking populations. The population crisis is leading to abandoned buildings, a reduced workforce, and a smaller consumer market. These demographic shifts present significant challenges for China's urban giants as they navigate a changing economic landscape.</p>

            <p>The U.S. House is reconsidering its voting rules after Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's push for proxy voting for new parents sparked a major debate. Luna's proposal, initially focused on new mothers, evolved into a bipartisan effort to extend proxy voting to all new parents, facing opposition from Republican leadership. The conflict highlighted the challenges of accommodating working parents in a centuries-old institution and raised questions about the constitutionality of proxy voting. Ultimately, a compromise was reached to implement a vote-pairing system, reflecting the ongoing struggle to balance tradition and modern needs.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for the Menendez brothers can proceed, despite opposition from the District Attorney's Office. Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have spent over 30 years in prison. Former DA George Gascón had filed a motion to reduce their sentences, making them eligible for parole, but current DA Nathan Hochman sought to withdraw that motion. The judge's decision allows the brothers to continue seeking a potential path to freedom, either through resentencing or clemency.</p>
