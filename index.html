          <p>Analysts from ING and Morgan Stanley believe Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC's, substantial US investment pledges might mitigate the impact of potential US tariffs.  TSMC's commitment of $165 billion in Arizona investments, announced in March, could lessen trade tensions. However, Taiwan still faces tariffs due to its trade surplus with the US, highlighting the complexities of global trade relations.</p>
