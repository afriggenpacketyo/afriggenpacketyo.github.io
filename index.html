            <p>Tottenham Hotspur's manager, Ange Postecoglou, is facing increasing pressure after the team's 4-2 defeat by Wolves, which highlighted defensive vulnerabilities and a lack of organization. The loss marked their 17th Premier League defeat of the season, raising questions about Postecoglou's future. While the manager's focus is on the upcoming Europa League quarter-final, another poor performance could jeopardize their trophy hopes and Postecoglou's position. Optimism score: 30</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the U.S. to "completely cancel" its tariffs as the trade war between the two countries continues. This follows President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause for some global tariffs, but an increase in levies on Chinese imports. The U.S. also announced exemptions for some technological products, which China called a "small step." There are no immediate plans for talks between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
