        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to move thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. The plan aims to cut 12,000 roles in London and close 11 offices, saving ¬£94 million annually by 2032. New government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with additional roles in other cities, intending to place 50% of senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030. The government anticipates the changes will bring ¬£729 million to the local economy by 2030 as part of a broader effort to shrink the civil service and reduce government running costs.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The judge's decision came after hearing testimony from family members who believe the brothers have reformed. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense due to years of abuse, while the prosecution argues they planned the murders for financial gain and have not taken responsibility. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings in June to determine if they should receive clemency, with the final decision resting with the governor.</p>

Randle, now playing for the Timberwolves, sees a similar mentality in his teammate Anthony Edwards, highlighting Edwards' leadership and charisma.
