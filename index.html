          <p>Monica Sementilli was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2017 stabbing death of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors argued she and her lover, Robert Baker, plotted the murder to collect on a life insurance policy, staging it to look like a burglary. Baker, whose DNA was found at the scene, pleaded no contest and was sentenced to life without parole, later testifying that Monica had no knowledge of the plan. Despite her defense's claims and her daughters' support, a jury convicted Monica, and she was sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Amid the catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country, stories of survival and heroism are emerging from the community of Ingram. One man, Julian Ryan, is being remembered as a hero after he died from injuries sustained while helping his family escape their flooded home. Another survivor credited her 19-year-old son with saving her life by holding onto him in the raging waters while they clung to a tree for an hour. As the search for numerous missing individuals continues, including children from a summer camp, Governor Greg Abbott has declared a day of prayer for the victims and their families.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 50 fatalities, with the death toll expected to rise as search and rescue operations continue. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, from which dozens of campers remain missing. Officials report that over 160 air rescues have been conducted, saving hundreds of people, some of whom were found clinging to trees. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, and federal officials have pledged support for the long recovery and rebuilding process ahead.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a dominant two-inning, scoreless pitching performance on his 31st birthday, striking out three batters and touching 101 mph. However, his strong start was not enough, as the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately fell to the Houston Astros 6-4. The Dodgers' long relief pitcher, Justin Wrobleski, struggled, giving up five runs and allowing the Astros to take a lead that proved insurmountable. Despite a home run from Miguel Rojas, the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome the deficit, clinching a series loss at home.</p>

          <p>New regulations for the Chinese Communist Party's central commissions and leading groups suggest a potential shift in President Xi Jinping's leadership style. The new rules, which aim to standardize top-level policy coordination, state that these powerful bodies should focus on "planning, discussing and checking on major matters." This has led some analysts to speculate that Xi may be delegating more decision-making power to his deputies. The move is being interpreted by some as a potential signal regarding his long-term succession plan, though the full implications of the changes remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time for the murder of his wife, Suzanne, who disappeared in 2020. Her remains, found in a shallow grave in 2023, revealed the presence of tranquilizer drugs used on wildlife, which Barry, an avid hunter, had access to. Initial charges were dropped in 2022, but a new grand jury indictment points to this key toxicological evidence. Investigators had previously pieced together a complex case involving a secret affair Suzanne was having, a "chipmunk alibi" from Barry, and suspicious data from his truck, but lacked direct proof until the discovery of her body.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country highlights the region's geographical vulnerability, earning it the name "Flash Flood Alley." The area's steep hills and thin, rocky soil prevent significant water absorption, causing rainfall to rapidly sheet off into creeks and rivers. This runoff can cause water levels to rise with terrifying speed, as seen when the Guadalupe River surged over 20 feet in less than two hours. The Balcones Escarpment, a geologic fault line, further exacerbates the risk by forcing warm, moist air from the Gulf to rise and condense, leading to intense downpours that can quickly become deadly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For young people struggling to find a summer job due to a lack of experience, careers experts offer several key strategies. They advise highlighting transferable skills from volunteering, sports, or even home responsibilities to demonstrate teamwork and problem-solving abilities. Experts also recommend keeping CVs concise and simple, tailoring cover letters to the specific job, and not being afraid to drop off a CV in person at local businesses. While online applications have made the job market more competitive, showing initiative and preparing thoroughly for interviews can help inexperienced candidates stand out and secure their first role.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Donald Trump Employs 'Madman Theory' in Foreign Policy Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Donald Trump is strategically using unpredictability, a political science concept known as the "Madman Theory," to reshape global relations. This approach, which aims to convince adversaries and allies that he is temperamentally capable of anything, has yielded some results, such as compelling NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending. However, critics question its long-term effectiveness, particularly against foes like Russia and Iran, and worry it could undermine trust in the U.S. as a reliable negotiator. The strategy relies on a highly centralized, personality-driven foreign policy that marks a departure from traditional American diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA), designed to help people under 40 save for a first home or retirement with a 25% government bonus, is a product that divides opinion. Some users praise it as an excellent tool that helped them get onto the property ladder. However, many others criticize its strict rules, particularly the penalty for early withdrawal and the £450,000 property price cap, which has not been updated since 2017 despite rising house prices. Critics, including MPs and financial experts, argue these flaws can unfairly penalize savers and are calling for reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

The event was organized to show solidarity with those affected by the recent wave of detentions and to call for an end to the operations. Participants expressed outrage and defiance, jogging through areas like MacArthur Park, Chinatown, and the Fashion District, ending near the Metropolitan Detention Center. The run took place a day after ICE agents continued their operations, detaining several people across Southern California on the Fourth of July.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal formed Saturday off the coast of South Carolina, prompting tropical storm warnings for coastal areas of both North and South Carolina. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, is forecast to make landfall early Sunday between Charleston and Cape Fear. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm may strengthen slightly before reaching the coast but will weaken rapidly afterward. Residents in the warning area are being advised to prepare for heavy rainfall of up to six inches, potential flash flooding, gusty winds, and high rip currents through Monday.</p>

          <p>A timeline of the devastating Texas floods reveals the rapid escalation of the disaster in the early hours of July 4th. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch on Thursday afternoon, which was upgraded to a more serious flood warning and finally a rare "flash flood emergency" alert as the situation became critical. Despite these warnings, the Guadalupe River surged as much as 30 feet between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., overwhelming local communities. Officials stated they had pre-positioned rescue assets, but the unprecedented volume of rain was not fully anticipated, leading to questions about the effectiveness of the warning systems.</p>

However, a chaotic final 10 minutes saw a late Dortmund comeback attempt and a stunning acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé for Madrid's third. A red card for Madrid's Dean Huijsen in stoppage time means he will miss the highly anticipated semifinal clash against Mbappé's former club.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are raising alarms over the Trump administration's recent cuts to scientific research funding, which includes grants for HIV and AIDS. Dr. John Brooks, former chief medical officer for the CDC's HIV prevention division, warns that these reductions threaten decades of progress. He notes that while treatment for current patients may continue, the cuts severely impact prevention efforts and the development of a potential vaccine or cure. Despite the administration's stated goal of eliminating HIV in the U.S. by 2030, experts fear these funding slashes could lead to a resurgence in new infections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party. His departure further shrinks the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-212. This could create additional challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson in managing his conference and passing legislation, a difficulty that was already evident during recent votes on major spending bills.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for sending an email claiming that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the message as "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, income-limited tax deduction for seniors. The communication from the typically apolitical agency has been blasted as partisan and misleading, with observers noting that it sounds more like a political campaign message than an official government communication.

The billionaire suggested the party could achieve significant influence by focusing on a small number of key congressional races, thereby acting as a deciding vote in a narrowly divided legislature. This announcement follows a public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump, for whom Musk was a major donor in 2024. Musk has been a vocal opponent of Trump's recent massive spending bill, which he cited as a reason for needing a new party. (not investment advice)</p>
