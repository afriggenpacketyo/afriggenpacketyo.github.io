            <p>The Trump administration is contemplating new tariffs on semiconductors following the recent removal of reciprocal tariffs on certain electronics. This potential move comes as the administration launches an investigation into semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security concerns. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the electronics tariff exemptions are temporary and will be replaced by the semiconductor tariff within a couple of months. The administration aims to incentivize the reshoring of semiconductor manufacturing to the United States, as China is currently the top source of electronic products. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the United States to fully eliminate its reciprocal tariffs as trade tensions between the two countries persist. Despite a recent announcement of a 90-day pause on some global tariffs, the US has increased levies on Chinese imports. The US Commerce Secretary indicated that exemptions for certain electronic products would be temporary, with plans to impose a separate "semiconductor tariff" in the future. These developments have created uncertainty and dampened hopes for a thaw in the trade relationship.</p>

            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping currently have no plans to communicate amid escalating trade tensions between the two nations. Since April 2nd, the situation has been elevated to the leaders' level, with expectations that a conversation will occur at some point. China responded to the U.S.'s increased tariffs by raising tariffs on U.S. goods, citing violations of international economic and trade rules. Greer emphasized that the U.S. is focused on reshoring American manufacturing and trade, and the current situation is a result of China's decision to retaliate.</p>
