          <p>President Trump has announced an immediate termination of all trade discussions with Canada, citing the country's new digital services tax on large technology companies as a "direct and blatant attack." The president stated on social media that the U.S. will determine a new tariff rate for Canada within the next week. This move abruptly escalates trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners, coming just a week after the two nations' leaders met at the G7 summit. The policy mirrors disputes the U.S. has with the European Union over similar taxes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 in favor of a group of Maryland parents, allowing them to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving books with LGBTQ themes. The parents, from various religious backgrounds, argued that the school district's policy violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, stated the policy placed an unconstitutional burden on the parents' rights. The dissenting justices warned the decision could lead to "chaos" for public schools by creating administrative burdens and undermining inclusive education efforts.</p>

The judge noted that Monzo's actions were predominantly caused by his consumption of cannabis, which he knew induced paranoia.

However, some Democratic lawmakers expressed concern after a classified briefing, suggesting Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium may not have been destroyed and that the country could still be close to developing a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised a 6-3 Supreme Court decision that limits the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, calling it a "monumental victory for the Constitution." The ruling stemmed from legal challenges to his executive order on birthright citizenship.

The administration believes this will allow it to proceed with numerous policies that had been blocked by lower courts, though dissenting justices warned it endangers constitutional rights.</p>

The governor's complaint accuses the network of willfully distorting facts to curry favor with the president, while Fox News has dismissed the lawsuit as a "frivolous publicity stunt."</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including pre-ordering large amounts of inventory to avoid duties and temporarily absorbing costs to protect consumers. Companies are also leveraging loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay tariff payments while waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy. However, experts caution that these buffers are temporary and price increases are still likely in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The defense's argument followed seven weeks of testimony from 34 government witnesses, including Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura Fine.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren SÃ¡nchez are celebrating their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of celebrities and business leaders. Guests seen in the city for the multi-day festivities include Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates. The high-profile event has reportedly caused some friction with Venice locals, leading to a "No Space for Bezos" campaign amid broader concerns about over-tourism. The wedding is the second for both Bezos and SÃ¡nchez, who began their relationship after divorcing their previous spouses in 2019.</p>

          <p>For savers with $10,000, the choice between a high-yield savings account and a money market account currently yields very similar returns. With top rates around 4.30% for high-yield savings and 4.32% for money markets, the difference in earnings over a year is only about $2. Both account types feature variable rates that are expected to decline with future interest rate cuts. This analysis demonstrates that either option is a significant improvement over traditional savings accounts and the decision between them depends more on specific account features than on potential interest earnings.

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor will have a chilling effect on public education nationwide. The ruling requires schools to allow parents with religious objections to opt their children out of lessons featuring books with LGBTQ+ characters. The article suggests this creates a significant administrative burden and legal risk for schools, which will likely lead them to preemptively exclude any materials with queer themes to avoid lawsuits. This, in effect, imposes a de facto "Don't Say Gay" regime, prioritizing the views of religious conservatives over inclusive education.</p>

          <p>Amid rising consumer debt, debt forgiveness through negotiation is becoming a more common consideration for financially strained Americans. This article outlines five types of debt that are often eligible for settlement, where a borrower pays a reduced lump sum to clear the balance. Unsecured debts like credit card balances and personal loans are prime candidates, as creditors prefer partial recovery over a total loss. Medical bills, buy now, pay later plans, and even high-interest payday loans may also be negotiable, particularly if the accounts are significantly delinquent and the borrower can demonstrate financial hardship.</p>

          <p>After qualifying for the Wimbledon main draw, 21-year-old British tennis player Oliver Tarvet has called for a reform of the NCAA's rules on prize money. As a student at the University of San Diego, Tarvet is restricted to claiming only $10,000 in profit annually from professional tournaments, plus expenses, despite earning Â£66,000 for reaching the first round. Tarvet stated that he believes he has earned the prize money and that a rule change would be appropriate. His comments echo a recent class-action lawsuit filed by other college players challenging the NCAA's restrictions on athlete earnings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," is reviewed as a deliberate return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her earlier work, set against the backdrop of downtown Manhattan. The article notes that while the album aims to capture visceral, real-world experiences, it often becomes a study in self-consciousness, reflecting a culture where introspection can supplant broader connection. The production, influenced by artists like Charli XCX, is described as having the trappings of radicalism but ultimately feeling like smooth, streamable pop. The review concludes that the album's intense self-focus highlights a potential dead end for the first-person pop style Lorde herself pioneered.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is a "grievous blow" to the separation of powers and the courts' ability to check unconstitutional executive actions. The author contends that the 6-3 ruling in Trump v. CASA radically and wrongly restricts judicial power, forcing challenges to federal policies to be litigated separately in all 94 districts. This could allow an unconstitutional act to remain in effect in some parts of the country while being blocked in others. The author echoes the dissenters' warnings that this decision poses an "existential threat to the rule of law."</p>

          <p>In a series of updates, President Trump expressed his support for the cryptocurrency industry, calling it a powerful sector that the U.S. has dominated. Separately, the president appeared flexible on a self-imposed July Fourth deadline for passing his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," stating the date is important but not final. House Speaker Mike Johnson also acknowledged the deadline could slide as the House awaits the Senate's version of the bill. Trump blamed Democrats for the legislative delay, suggesting they oppose the bill because it is politically advantageous for Republicans.</p>

          <p>Officials within the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have reportedly described the government's accelerated employment support plans as "undeliverable" and "a mess." The Â£1 billion program, fast-tracked as part of a compromise on welfare reforms, is intended to help benefit recipients find work. However, internal sources told the BBC that the program lacks a coherent strategy and sufficient staffing, with very low expectations for its success in helping people return to the job market. The DWP responded by stating it is committed to its employment goals and has taken "decisive action."</p>
