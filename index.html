          <p>The UK government is planning reforms to licensing rules aimed at safeguarding pubs and live music venues from closure due to noise complaints. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new businesses and expanding outdoor service areas, with the goal of revitalizing struggling town centers. This initiative comes as the hospitality industry faces numerous closures attributed to rising costs and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>A stampede at the Mansa Devi temple in Haridwar, northern India, has resulted in the deaths of at least six people and left more than 30 others injured. The tragic incident reportedly occurred after a high-voltage electric wire fell onto a crowded path, causing widespread panic among the thousands of devotees gathered at the popular Hindu pilgrimage site. This event is the latest in a series of deadly crowd crushes in India this year, highlighting persistent safety challenges at large religious gatherings. Authorities have launched rescue operations and are investigating the precise cause of the panic.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has initiated a "24-hour economy" policy aimed at transforming the nation's economic landscape and reducing its reliance on imports. The plan involves encouraging key industries to operate in three eight-hour shifts, effectively running around the clock to increase productivity and create jobs. While the vision is to generate millions of new employment opportunities, economists raise concerns about its feasibility, citing the need for substantial funding and improved infrastructure, such as a stable power supply. The success of this ambitious project will depend heavily on private sector investment and a significant shift in the national work culture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China Increases Censorship of Mass Attacks, Prompting Online Complaints</h2>

          <p>The Chinese government has intensified its efforts to control information about mass casualty events, such as recent incidents where drivers have struck pedestrians. Official reports are often delayed or omit key details, like the proximity to a school, while photos and discussion are scrubbed from the internet. This increased censorship appears to be a response to a directive from leader Xi Jinping to prevent copycat crimes. However, the information blackout is causing frustration among some citizens, who are turning to social media to complain and demand transparency from local authorities.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, with RSF commander Hemedti as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation. This development follows an agreement between the RSF and other rebel and civilian groups aiming to establish a secular state. The UN has warned that this action risks further fragmenting Sudan and undermining diplomatic peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he had spoken with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, pressing them for an immediate ceasefire after recent deadly border clashes.

          <p>Turkey has recorded its highest temperature ever, reaching 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Boston Red Sox 4-2, unable to capitalize on an early lead established by first-inning home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet settled down after the initial onslaught, striking out ten and preventing further damage over six innings. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled to hold the lead, giving up three runs in the second inning and a fourth in the fifth. Despite several opportunities, the Dodgers' offense was stymied by Crochet's performance and a few costly outs on the basepaths.</p>
