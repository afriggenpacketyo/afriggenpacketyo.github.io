            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee addressed concerns regarding President Trump's proposed tariffs, noting anxieties from Midwest business leaders about their potential impact on operations. He acknowledged preemptive purchasing behaviors in anticipation of tariffs and expressed hope for a future "golden age of global trade." Goolsbee also emphasized the importance of monetary independence from political interference, citing historical data indicating that countries without it experience higher inflation and slower growth. He stated that questioning monetary independence would undermine the credibility of the Fed and the stability of the economy as a whole.</p>

            <p>Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey condemned the Trump administration's decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard University and other research institutions, highlighting the detrimental impact on scientific research, healthcare, and American competitiveness. She emphasized that the cuts are leading to research lab shutdowns, scientist layoffs, and the halting of crucial clinical trials, including cancer treatments. Healey asserted that states cannot compensate for the scale of federal funding cuts and that Trump's actions are essentially inviting other countries to take America's scientists and researchers.

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen discussed his trip to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported and accused of gang affiliation. Van Hollen stated that the Salvadoran government initially obstructed his access to Abrego Garcia, later staging a meeting to create a false impression of Abrego Garcia's well-being. He emphasized the importance of due process and constitutional rights for all individuals, criticizing the Trump administration for allegedly violating Abrego Garcia's rights. He also noted that the administration has not presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, urging officials to provide evidence in court.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelans held in a Texas detention center under the Alien Enemies Act. This decision came after an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that the government was attempting to restart deportations without allowing detainees to argue their case in court. The ACLU cited concerns about the detainees being sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The White House responded by claiming the detainees were foreign terrorists, while Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court's intervention was premature.</p>

Homan argued that due process rights are more limited under the Alien Enemies Act, which the administration invoked to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants.

            <p>The Israeli military acknowledged "professional failures" in the deaths of 15 Palestinian paramedics in Gaza last month, stating that breaches of orders and an "operational misunderstanding" played a role. The investigation found no evidence to support claims of execution but cited poor night visibility and an assessment by troops that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants. A commanding officer will be remanded, and a deputy commander dismissed. The Israeli military claimed six of the victims were members of Hamas but provided no evidence. The incident sparked international criticism, with the UN reporting that hundreds of aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October 2023.</p>

            <p>An Israeli investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza found "professional failures," leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander. The military initially claimed the medics' vehicles lacked emergency signals, but later backtracked after cellphone video contradicted this. The investigation cited poor night visibility and an assessment that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants. The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members, a claim disputed by medical personnel. The International Criminal Court has accused Israeli leaders of war crimes, which Israel disputes.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., stated that his trip to El Salvador was to defend the constitutional rights of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident deported despite a court order, not to defend the man himself. Van Hollen emphasized that the Trump administration admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was wrongfully detained and deported. He criticized El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele for complicity in the scheme and violating international law. Van Hollen also refuted claims that Democrats are defending a gang member, asserting the importance of upholding constitutional rights for everyone.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that Kilmar Ábrego García, mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been moved to a new prison. Van Hollen said Ábrego García was "traumatised" and fearful in the notorious mega-jail Cecot. The Supreme Court has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, but the White House maintains he will not return. Van Hollen criticized the Trump administration's handling of the deportation and stressed the importance of due process. Ábrego García's case is part of a showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts on immigration.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in Alaska LNG, a massive natural gas project, to navigate Trump's tariffs and secure trade deals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touted the project as crucial for trade negotiations. Taiwan's CPC Corp. signed a letter of intent to purchase gas and offered direct investment. The project includes an 800-mile pipeline, a gas processing plant, and a liquefaction plant, aiming to produce 20 million metric tons of LNG per year. The Trump administration views Alaska LNG as strategically important, offering a direct route to Asia and boosting U.S. energy dominance.</p>

Congolese police believe the fire was ignited by cooking onboard the overcrowded vessel. Boat accidents are common in Congo due to inadequate infrastructure and safety measures.</p>

Thibaud Hug de Larauze suggests Americans may opt for used electronics to avoid higher prices on new devices. Prolonged tariffs could cause a "huge uptick" in sales of used devices, particularly smartphones, according to analysts. The timeline is unpredictable, but Back Market expects a shift towards more U.S. customers buying refurbished tech if tariffs are implemented. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an ACLU appeal citing concerns about deportations to El Salvador's CECOT prison.

The ACLU sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans and sought an order barring removals of all immigrants in the region under the Act.
