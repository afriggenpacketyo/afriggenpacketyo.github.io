          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to reach 31C on Sunday after peaking on Saturday. Amber heat health alerts remain active for several regions in England, warning of potential health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The extreme weather has prompted hosepipe bans for millions and contributed to wildfire warnings in Scotland and a blaze in Surrey. While temperatures are forecast to cool down with rain expected early next week, the event highlights the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves linked to climate change.</p>

          <p>Following her acquittal in the death of John O'Keefe, Karen Read has secured a book deal, while key trial witnesses report facing ongoing harassment and a lack of protection. The family of the victim, John O'Keefe, continues to grieve as the case's key players move on, including Read's defense lawyer who is taking on another high-profile case. The verdict has also had professional consequences for law enforcement involved, with one detective being fired and a supervisor reassigned. Meanwhile, a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Read is still proceeding.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study offers surprising insights into the impact of China's dams on the Tibetan plateau, suggesting they may alleviate rather than create water crises for downstream nations like India. By analyzing data from the Zangmu and Jiacha dams since 2014, researchers found that water flows during the dry season have significantly increased. Specifically, low flows in February were up by over 50 percent, countering fears that the massive dam projects would lead to droughts in India. This evidence provides a new perspective on the environmental consequences of China's hydroelectric projects in the region.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers from both parties conducted their first tour of the controversial 'Alligator Alcatraz' migrant detention facility in the Everglades, emerging with conflicting reports on its conditions. Democratic representatives described the facility as an 'internment camp' with 'appalling' conditions, citing 85-degree temperatures in the medical area and claims of inadequate water and food. In contrast, Republican lawmakers stated they were satisfied, with one senator calling the beds more comfortable than his own at home. The state has denied all allegations of inhumane conditions, while Democrats are calling for future hearings and accountability.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized a proposal by the U.S. President to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. In letters to both trading partners, the President threatened even higher taxes if they chose to retaliate, framing the move as necessary to address long-term trade deficits. The EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, warned of 'proportionate countermeasures,' while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum insisted the country's sovereignty is non-negotiable. The announcement escalates trade tensions and puts pressure on ongoing negotiations to avert a potential trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's struggling steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Redcar, are facing a precarious future due to a long-term industry decline exacerbated by rising energy costs and uncertainty over US tariffs. The closure of blast furnaces has led to thousands of job losses, fraying the economic and social fabric of communities built around steelmaking. While there is hope that investment in green technologies could revive the sector, analysts are divided on its viability. The ongoing threat of US tariffs adds another layer of anxiety, potentially costing the industry vital orders and hindering future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vast Rubaya mining site in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which is a critical source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. The report highlights how thousands of miners work under the armed group's authority, which profits from taxing the mineral essential for mobile phones and other electronics. This access comes as a US-brokered ceasefire deal between DR Congo and Rwanda was signed, with the US President hinting at securing mineral rights. The situation underscores the complex link between the region's long-standing conflict, its immense mineral wealth, and global geopolitics.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas during the July Fourth weekend have killed at least 129 people, with dozens still missing. The disaster, which devastated communities and a summer camp, was caused by a massive, slow-moving weather system that dumped extreme amounts of rain in a flood-prone area. In the aftermath, officials are facing intense scrutiny over the lack of timely warnings and evacuation orders, with many survivors saying they received no alert before the deluge hit. The event has been described as a '100-year flood,' prompting a massive search and recovery effort.</p>

The grim discovery was made by a local amateur historian, Catherine Corliss, whose research uncovered death records for 796 children with no corresponding burial records.

          <p>A new study analyzing federal traffic safety data has identified the most dangerous times to be on the road in the ten most populated U.S. states. The research, which reviewed fatal accident statistics from 2019 to 2023, found that evening hours are overwhelmingly the deadliest, with the 6:00 PM to 9:59 PM window being the most frequent period for fatal crashes. For example, in California, the most dangerous hour is 8:00-8:59 PM, while in Texas it is 9:00-9:59 PM. Pennsylvania was the only outlier, with its deadliest hour occurring in the afternoon between 3:00 and 3:59 PM.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from 'indiscriminately' detaining individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, also bars officials from denying detainees access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a bus stop without reasonable suspicion. The judge stated there was a 'mountain of evidence' that officials were unconstitutionally basing arrests on factors like race or speaking Spanish.</p>
