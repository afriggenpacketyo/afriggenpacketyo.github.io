          <p>Overnight into Tuesday morning, Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles targeting Ukrainian cities including Kyiv and Odesa, resulting in at least two deaths and multiple injuries. Ukrainian air defenses claimed to have neutralized a significant number of the incoming aerial attacks, but civilian infrastructure, including a maternity hospital in Odesa, sustained considerable damage. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks and called for stronger international action to pressure Russia into peace, specifically urging the United States and Europe to take concrete steps. Ukraine also continued its own drone strike campaign, according to Russia's Defense Ministry, which claimed to have downed 103 Ukrainian drones. Optimism surrounding the situation is low considering the high death toll and the author's tone of grave concern.</p>

          <p>Following a protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, disorder broke out, leading to condemnation from local MP Jim Allister. Masked individuals engaged in violence, throwing objects at police and setting properties on fire, resulting in property damage and police intervention to control the unrest. Allister attributed the demonstration's context to demographic changes in the area due to immigration. Two teenage boys appeared in court, accused of the sexual assault, and denied the charges through their solicitor after speaking with an interpreter in Romanian to confirm their names and ages.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing its fourth day of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, marked by escalating tensions and the deployment of the National Guard. Demonstrations intensified, with protesters blocking freeways and setting self-driving cars on fire, leading to clashes with law enforcement who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of the Guard without state consultation, calling it illegal and immoral. The protests have resulted in numerous arrests and significant property damage, including vandalism of the LAPD headquarters and other federal buildings.</p>

The cyber attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially affected click and collect and contactless payments, leading to an estimated Â£300 million hit to the retailer's profits.

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could trigger a rapid outflow of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests that the U.S. fund management industry, with around $18 trillion invested in U.S. stock markets, would be "collateral damage" due to the impact of Section 899. The proposed tax, starting at 5% and escalating to 20%, could deter foreign investors and depress U.S. equity markets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The article argues that the United States' increasing restrictions on international students and scholars could compromise its human capital and technological advancement. Restricting international students would reduce the talent pool for U.S. graduate schools, particularly in STEM fields, where international students earn about half of the PhDs. As a result, more American students are exploring academic options abroad while overseas applications to the U.S. decline. The article suggests that if the intention is to slow Chinaâ€™s technological progress, it is too late, as many Chinese students who studied abroad have returned to contribute to their home country's academic and technological sectors.</p>

At the company's annual general meeting, domestic shareholders echoed concerns raised by international investors like Zennor Asset Management and Oasis Management. Critics argue that the acquisition strengthens the Toyoda family's control over the group and does not adequately compensate minority shareholders for the company's assets, including substantial real estate holdings.

          <p>China's recent export restrictions on rare earth minerals are expected to impact Western defense giants, with analysts warning of potential disruptions to the production of critical military technologies. The restrictions, imposed in response to U.S. tariffs, require firms to apply for licenses for rare earth exports, affecting elements essential for advanced radar systems, laser guidance, and propulsion technologies. While some progress has been made in trade talks, the restrictions have already led to concerns about production delays and potential national security implications for the U.S. and its allies. The U.S., European Union, and Australia must coordinate supply- and demand-side interventions to boost rare earths production.</p>

Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will be sold directly to retailers. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness and leading Koizumi to consider increasing rice imports.

          <h2>China-Niger Relations Face Strain Amidst Non-Interference Policy Challenges</h2>

          <p>China's relations with Niger have been strained following disputes with Chinese oil companies over labor practices, testing Beijing's cornerstone non-interference policy. Despite initially strengthening ties with Niger's military government through a substantial oil-backed loan, tensions arose when the junta expelled Chinese oil executives and revoked the license of a Chinese-owned hotel. Observers note that this dispute underscores the limits of Beijing's non-interference policy, which, while aiming to avoid domestic affairs, can incur economic costs as some nations experience a rise in nationalism. China's policy entails regime strengthening since Beijing tends to invest heavily in the economic priorities of the regimes or ruling parties in question.</p>

          <p>According to a recent government report, Japan is lagging behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the share of women in leadership positions. The report acknowledges that Japan's efforts remain insufficient, as indicated by its low ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. The government has set a goal to raise the share of women in leadership roles to about 30 percent, but the proportion at major firms remains low. The government plans to step up efforts to advance gender equality and women's empowerment.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to Southeast Asia for final assembly or re-export, partially to offset the impact of high U.S. tariffs. Factories often inject enough local content into goods from China to declare any re-exports as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.</p>
