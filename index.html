          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testified before a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, facing questions about the administration's immigration raids in Los Angeles and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to the city. Representative Betty McCollum inquired about the cost and resource implications of sending military personnel to Los Angeles, but Hegseth did not directly answer. Hegseth defended ICE's right to conduct operations nationwide and compared the situation to the 2020 George Floyd protests, stating that the National Guard and Marines were deployed to protect ICE's duties. The hearing also addressed Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss military plans, raising concerns about security protocols.</p>

The mayor's statement suggests a complex dynamic, with authorities attempting to manage the unrest while acknowledging the presence of groups perceived as instigating violence, amidst broader concerns about federal immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests couples can improve their relationships by creating a "relationship bank account." This involves making "deposits" through actions that prioritize the other person's happiness, aiming to build a positive balance that helps manage conflicts. A positive balance signifies emotional security, enabling couples to handle disagreements with minimal conflict, while a negative balance can lead to escalating fights. The goal is to increase deposits over withdrawals, reducing the intensity and frequency of arguments, by identifying and acting on what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated.</p>

          <p>CoreCivic, the largest U.S. private prison operator, faces a lawsuit after an inmate was allegedly killed by his cellmate a day before his scheduled release. The family of the deceased, Matthew Vogel, claims that cost-cutting and understaffing at the South Central Correctional Facility in Tennessee contributed to his death. The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has reinstated the use of private prisons by federal agencies, potentially benefiting CoreCivic through new contracts. The company disputes the claims, asserting proper staffing levels and adherence to security protocols, though audits have indicated staffing deficiencies and high turnover rates at CoreCivic facilities.</p>

The rise in average wages slowed to 5.2% between February and April, remaining above the inflation rate of 3.5%.
