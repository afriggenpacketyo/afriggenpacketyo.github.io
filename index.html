          <p>Four members of Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force sustained minor injuries in an explosion while handling an unexploded bomb near the U.S. military's Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. The incident occurred at a GSDF storage facility where the soldiers, belonging to an explosive ordnance disposal unit, were preparing to dispose of a bomb left over from World War II. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of continuing disposal efforts due to the numerous unexploded bombs still buried in Okinawa. The Self-Defense Forces conducted over 1,800 disposal operations nationwide in fiscal year 2023, with a significant portion occurring in Okinawa, which hosts the majority of U.S. military facilities in Japan.</p>

The talks aim to confirm China's commitment to restoring the flow of critical minerals and easing export controls from the U.S., following accusations of violating a previous agreement made in Geneva. These discussions follow a phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, as both sides seek to avert a full-blown trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles intensified over the weekend in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to address immigration enforcement operations. Demonstrators blocked a major freeway, set self-driving cars on fire, and clashed with law enforcement, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as a breach of state sovereignty and urged the president to withdraw the Guard, while Mayor Karen Bass blamed the administration for provoking chaos. The protests, which began in response to federal agents arresting immigrants in the LA area, have led to numerous arrests and escalating tensions between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for selling all their possessions in 2017 to invest in Bitcoin, has overhauled their security measures following increased kidnapping threats targeting cryptocurrency executives. They have moved away from hardware wallets and now use a hybrid system involving analog and digital methods, including encrypting and splitting seed phrases across four continents. This decentralized approach aims to protect their crypto holdings by making it difficult for potential attackers to access their funds even under duress. The family's new measures reflect growing concerns about physical attacks on crypto holders and the need for enhanced personal security.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery plans to divide into two publicly traded companies, separating its cable networks (including CNN and TNT Sports) from its streaming and studios business (including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television). CEO David Zaslav will lead the Streaming & Studios division, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head Global Networks. This split, expected by mid-2026, reverses much of the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery, as cable networks face declining viewership due to the shift to streaming services. The company believes this restructuring will allow each entity to pursue growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value.</p>

          <p>A prominent Sikh house of worship in the US is calling for a Department of Justice investigation into the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), alleging it operates as a 'foreign agent' on behalf of the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Fremont Gurdwara Sahib claims that the HAF has facilitated meetings between foreign officials and US lawmakers while advocating for the interests of the BJP. The HAF denies these claims, asserting its independence and accusing the Khalistan separatist movement of coordinated attacks. The allegations come amid heightened tensions between Sikhs supporting an independent state and the Indian government.</p>

          <p>The suicide of an 18-year-old girl in China has sparked renewed discussion about the intense academic pressure faced by students. In a suicide note, the girl described the stress of relentless exams and the pressure to perform well, which she felt had become unbearable. Her father confirmed that she had always been a high-achieving student, but had hidden her feelings of distress. Experts suggest that excessive schoolwork and the societal emphasis on academic success contribute to rising suicide rates among children and adolescents in China.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill could significantly alter student loan programs, potentially making college less accessible for low-income families. The legislation includes changes to Pell Grant eligibility requirements, such as increasing the required course credits for maximum aid, which could reduce or eliminate grants for many recipients. It also proposes eliminating subsidized loans and imposing lifetime borrowing caps, which may increase college costs and disproportionately affect students in professional programs. Critics argue that these cuts, aimed at funding tax cuts for the wealthy, would further disadvantage vulnerable populations.</p>
