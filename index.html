          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned from his position as chairman of Reform UK, citing a belief that working towards a Reform government is no longer a valuable use of his time. Yusuf, a former Conservative Party member, had been instrumental in the party's recent electoral successes, including winning a by-election and gaining new councillors. His resignation follows criticism of a Reform MP's call to ban the burka, which Yusuf deemed "dumb". Nathaniel Fried, who led the Doge unit, is also stepping down with Yusuf, and political figures have commented on the resignation, with some criticizing Reform UK's internal management.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a significant decrease in April, coinciding with President Trump's tariff escalation. Imports declined by 16% as trade barriers took effect, leading to a trade deficit of approximately $61 billion, a substantial drop from the previous month's $140 billion. Despite the narrowing deficit, the outlook for Trump's tariff policy and the wider economy remains uncertain due to the administration's inconsistent approach to tariffs. Consumer attitudes have soured, and economists are closely monitoring consumer spending and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The order has drawn criticism from human rights organizations and some foreign governments, while supporters argue it is necessary to protect Americans.

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, a move that experts predict will increase costs for consumers on a variety of products. Industries such as automobile manufacturing, sports equipment, and canned goods are likely to be affected, with potential price increases for cars, baseball bats, and canned soup. While some steelmakers may benefit, economists warn that the tariffs will put pressure on consumers and could negatively impact industries that rely on these metals.

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents Â£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. While Sir Keir Starmer supports the measure, he faces calls to scrap the two-child benefit cap. The government has allocated Â£1bn to fund the change and pledged Â£13m to food charities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously rejected a lawsuit brought by Mexico against American gun manufacturers, alleging their practices contributed to violence by drug cartels. The court upheld a 2005 law protecting gun manufacturers from liability for misuse of their products. Mexico argued that the gunmakers knowingly supplied firearms to dealers who illegally sold to Mexican gun traffickers. The court found that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege the manufacturers aided and abetted unlawful sales.</p>
