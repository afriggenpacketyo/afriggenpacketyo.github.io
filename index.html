          <p>Freida Parton has asked fans to pray for her sister, country music legend Dolly Parton, who recently postponed a Las Vegas residency due to unspecified health issues. The 79-year-old singer informed fans she needed to undergo a few procedures to address ongoing health challenges. This comes after Parton had to cancel a Dollywood appearance for a kidney stone and recently lost her husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Dean. Despite the concerns, Freida Parton expressed her strong belief that with the power of prayer, her sister will be just fine.</p>

          <p>The grinning skull pirate flag from the popular Japanese manga "One Piece" has been adopted as a symbol of resistance by youth-led protest movements across the globe. Initially gaining traction in Indonesia, the banner of the series' freedom-seeking Straw Hat Crew has appeared in demonstrations in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, and Madagascar. Experts note the flag's themes of challenging corrupt authority resonate with Gen Z activists. This follows a trend of pop culture symbols, such as the Guy Fawkes mask, being used to unify modern protest movements.</p>

          <p>The resignation of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu after just 27 days in office has intensified France's political deadlock, raising serious concerns about the nation's fiscal stability. This ongoing political chaos jeopardizes the country's ability to address its significant budget deficit and debt pile, which are both well above European Union limits. President Emmanuel Macron has given Lecornu 48 hours to find a path forward, but economists are pessimistic, forecasting continued budget slippage and slow economic growth due to the deep political fragmentation.

          <p>Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group has agreed to purchase the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB in a $5.4 billion deal aimed at bolstering its artificial intelligence capabilities. The acquisition aligns with founder Masayoshi Son's vision of creating "Physical AI" by fusing advanced intelligence with robotics. For ABB, the sale provides immediate value to its shareholders and serves as an alternative to its previous plan of spinning off the robotics business into a separately listed company. The deal is currently pending global regulatory approval.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation scheme for millions of consumers affected by the mis-selling of car finance agreements. The plan could see lenders pay out a total of £8.2 billion, with average individual payouts estimated at around £700 per claim. The redress addresses issues like undisclosed discretionary commissions and unfair contracts that led to customers being overcharged. While consumer advocates have welcomed the move, industry representatives have suggested the scale of the proposed compensation is implausibly high.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prosecution of two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, for allegedly spying for China has been dropped by the UK's Crown Prosecution Service. The Director of Public Prosecutions stated the case collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence that officially designated China as a "threat to national security" during the period of the alleged offenses. This specific legal threshold, which was clarified in a separate, recent espionage trial involving Russian spies, proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the prosecution.</p>

          <p>US golfer Collin Morikawa has acknowledged that the behavior of some American fans toward the European team at the recent Ryder Cup in New York was inappropriate. Europe's victory was marred by incidents of verbal abuse directed at players, most notably Rory McIlroy, who described some of the conduct as "unacceptable." Morikawa clarified that his pre-tournament call for fans to create "chaos" was not an encouragement for rudeness, emphasizing that a line must be drawn between energetic support and disrespectful conduct.</p>

          <p>The price of spot gold has surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid growing global economic and political instability. Analysts attribute the rally to factors including trade tensions and delays in economic data releases due to the U.S. government shutdown. This trend is also reflected in record inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While some experts believe the upward trend could continue, they also caution that prices could fall if geopolitical tensions ease or interest rates rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm as it moves parallel to the Pacific coast of Mexico and the Baja California Sur peninsula. The storm is bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region, prompting forecasters to issue warnings for potential flash flooding and dangerous, life-threatening surf conditions. Although Priscilla is expected to remain offshore and gradually weaken, moisture from the system is projected to track northward, potentially bringing heavy rainfall to parts of the U.S. Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts is carefully navigating the use of rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who has quickly become the team's most effective relief option during the playoffs. In a recent high-leverage situation, Roberts initially held Sasaki back to manage his workload, a decision that nearly proved costly before Sasaki was ultimately brought in to secure the final out. Roberts has since confirmed Sasaki is the primary choice for saves but stressed the need to be judicious with the young pitcher, who is new to the demands of a bullpen role.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the celebrated author and illustrator of "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has shared that his new book was significantly delayed after his iPad was stolen. The device contained a substantial amount of un-backed-up work, including drawings and text for the book, which was taken from his unlocked car. This forced him to recreate much of the content from memory, a setback compounded by personal grief from the loss of his mother and his beloved dog during the book's six-year creation process.</p>

However, Republican and Green Party opponents have strongly condemned the proposal as a corrupt and unconstitutional power grab that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission, which was established by voters to prevent such partisan map-drawing.</p>
