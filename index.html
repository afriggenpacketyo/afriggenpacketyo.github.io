          <h2>Former HHS Workers Warn of Disease Outbreak Risks Due to Trump Health Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have raised concerns that mass terminations and budget cuts under the Trump administration, now led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, are jeopardizing public health. They claim that reductions in force have severely impacted key programs, including child support services and HIV treatment, potentially leading to missed disease outbreaks. The epidemiologist at the South Carolina Department of Public Health said that disease surveillance programs were gutted by the staff layoffs due to the federal funding cuts. The article highlights specific instances, such as the elimination of federal HIV prevention experts and increased workloads for child support specialists, which could have long-term impacts on vulnerable families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America released its annual allergy report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third year due to high tree and grass pollen counts. The article provides advice from Dr. Purvi Parikh on managing seasonal allergies, including starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing, which is highest in the mornings and late afternoons. Parikh also advises consulting a doctor if symptoms persist, as they could be due to colds or viruses. Staying informed and taking preventative measures can help individuals better navigate allergy season. The article also notes that different plants and trees release pollen at different times, so symptoms can vary depending on location.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports have experienced a significant surge. In the first quarter of the year, plug-in hybrid exports increased by nearly 600%, with a notable 1,849% increase in March alone. This trend is attributed to the UK's relatively lower import tariffs on Chinese cars compared to the European Union, making them a more affordable option for consumers. One Londoner shared that he chose a Chinese EV due to its affordability compared to Tesla. The UK is now China's second-largest export destination for EVs and fifth-largest for hybrid electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, totaling $26 billion, due to lower oil prices and reduced production. The company's free cash flow also decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, signaling continuing financial strain. In response to these challenges, Aramco has reduced its performance-linked dividend payout, impacting revenue for the Saudi government, which faces widening deficits. The article notes that despite OPEC+ production cuts to stabilize the market, oil prices have continued to face downward pressure due to economic uncertainty and anticipated supply gluts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that there will be imminent progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, expressing optimism about ending the "bloodbath" in a Truth Social post. His remarks follow Putin's announcement of a unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine claimed was violated. Zelenskyy offered a 30-day ceasefire and, after talks with European leaders, stated that a complete ceasefire should begin soon. Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, which Zelenskyy called a "positive sign", emphasizing the importance of a ceasefire as the first step towards ending the war.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues that mothers should cut themselves some slack and stop striving for perfection. She explains that psychiatrists have historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, which harms children by making them think mental health professionals will blame their parents. Ross encourages mothers to acknowledge their flaws and recognize that those imperfections are essential for children to learn acceptance. The article also includes a lighthearted quiz to help mothers realize they don't need to be perfect.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, has been found guilty of depraved heart murder for providing his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthetics that led to her death. Ryan, who was significantly older than Harris, initially met her when she was a patient and later employed her as his surgical assistant. The prosecution argued that Ryan controlled Harris by providing her with drugs, leading to her addiction and eventual overdose. The case hinged on incriminating texts and photos discovered after Harris's death, revealing a pattern of drug use and control. Ryan was sentenced to 45 years in prison.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained stable at 6.76%, near its highest levels this year, while 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a mediocre start to the spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. declined in March, marking the largest monthly drop since November 2022.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to USAID funding are having severe consequences for healthcare in Africa, with HIV patients losing access to medication and critical programs coming to a halt. Sub-Saharan Africa, a major recipient of USAID funding, faces the potential loss of up to 4 million lives due to treatable diseases. The pan-African NGO Amref Health Africa has experienced significant budget losses, leading to canceled educational programs and reduced tuberculosis screenings. Experts warn that these cuts could reverse years of progress in combating diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.</p>

          <p>President Trump has described the first day of trade talks between the US and China as "very good", stating that a "total reset" in trade relations has been negotiated in a friendly and constructive manner. The two countries are meeting in Geneva for the first time since Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory levies from China. The US president expressed hope for an opening up of China to American business, with great progress made. Despite this, the White House has indicated that Washington will not lower tariffs unilaterally, requiring concessions from China.</p>

          <p>Opposition politicians in Birmingham are disputing claims that bin collections have returned to normal, as industrial action by refuse workers continues. Despite the council stating that the vast majority of rubbish has been cleared, Conservative leader Robert Alden and Independent MP Ayoub Khan assert that bin lorries have stalled, leading to waste accumulation. The strike, initiated by Unite union members over role and pay changes, has drawn international attention. Rachel Taylor, Labour MP, accuses the opposition of political maneuvering, while the council maintains that it has cleared significant waste and is working towards service transformation.</p>

          <p>After a period of heightened tensions, India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire, with US President Donald Trump announcing the agreement. Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels, and regional players played a crucial role in de-escalating the conflict. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to the Pakistani Army Chief is believed to have been a crucial turning point. While the US played a significant role, both India and Pakistan have traded accusations of ceasefire violations, underscoring the fragility of the agreement.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested approximately $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with China's global trend of moving away from fossil fuels and focusing on renewable energy sources, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
