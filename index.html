          <p>Activists planning to sail an aid ship to Gaza claim their vessel, The Conscience, was attacked by drones in international waters near Malta, suggesting Israeli involvement. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition reported the incident, stating the ship issued an SOS signal immediately after the attack, which caused a fire and significant damage, rendering the ship unable to continue its mission. Maltese authorities confirmed the safety of all aboard and that the fire was brought under control, while the Israeli military is investigating the reports. Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who planned to join the voyage, condemned the attack and affirmed the activists' commitment to demanding a free Palestine and humanitarian corridor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report reveals that the USDA's Wildlife Services department killed nearly 2 million wild animals last year, employing methods such as firearms, poisons, and traps. While some killings are justified for protecting endangered species or preventing bird strikes at airports, a significant portion targets species like coyotes, starlings, feral hogs, and pigeons that conflict with animal agriculture. These animals are often killed to protect livestock and their feed, highlighting a consequence of meat production where wildlife habitats are cleared or degraded. Despite some efforts towards non-lethal deterrents, critics argue that the agency remains heavily reliant on lethal methods, perpetuating a cycle of conflict between agriculture and wildlife.</p>

          <p>Shell reported adjusted earnings of $5.58 billion for the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations despite a decrease from the $7.73 billion earned in the same period last year. The company announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of buybacks exceeding $3 billion, demonstrating confidence in its financial performance and strategic direction. Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, hailed the results as "another solid set" and reaffirmed the company's commitment to increasing shareholder returns while maintaining a reduced annual investment budget. This move contrasts with rival BP's decision to lower its share buyback after disappointing earnings.</p>

          <p>A Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) report recommends psychotherapy over gender-affirming care for transgender children and teens, citing alleged harms from medical interventions like puberty blockers and hormone therapies. The report claims low evidence for the safety and mental health benefits of puberty blockers and suggests a high certainty of infertility, which experts dispute. Medical professionals and organizations express alarm, emphasizing the safety and positive impact of gender-affirming care on mental health, while noting that psychotherapy alone cannot resolve gender dysphoria. Critics argue the report misrepresents medical consensus and could lead to misuse by governments to block access to necessary care.</p>

          <p>Israeli fighter jets conducted strikes near the presidential palace in Damascus, sending a message to President Ahmed al-Sharaa regarding Israel's willingness to intervene after recent sectarian violence. The strikes, the second such intervention in days, followed clashes involving Sunni Muslim extremists, government forces, and Druse militiamen, resulting in over 100 deaths. Defense Minister Israel Katz described the strikes as a warning to prevent harm to the Druse in Syria, while the Israeli military stated its forces were deployed to prevent hostile forces from entering the Druse region. The US State Department called on Syria’s government to stop the sectarian violence and hold the perpetrators accountable, as the Druse community in Israel presses for stronger intervention.</p>

          <p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined TikTok 530 million euros for violating the EU's GDPR data protection law by transferring European user data to China. The DPC, which oversees TikTok's privacy practices in the EU, ordered the company to comply with data processing regulations within six months, threatening to suspend data transfers to China if compliance is not achieved. The regulator cited TikTok's failure to ensure equivalent data protection standards for EEA users when their data was accessed by staff in China, particularly regarding potential access by Chinese authorities under anti-terrorism and counter-espionage laws.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act cannot be used to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be gang members, marking the first permanent injunction against the Trump administration's use of the act. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. stated that Trump's application of the act exceeded its scope, as it is intended for times of war or threatened invasion, neither of which apply to the alleged Tren de Aragua members. This ruling comes amid other news, including Trump's nomination of Mike Waltz as UN ambassador after removing him as national security advisor, continued Russian attacks in Ukraine, and Israeli strikes against Damascus.</p>

          <p>A mother traveling from Bristol to Belfast was reportedly asked by EasyJet staff to pay an additional charge for carrying breast milk and a breast pump as extra hand luggage, despite researching the airline's rules beforehand.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump criticized Democrats for pursuing impeachment efforts against him, suggesting that Republicans should consider expelling them from Congress for alleged crimes. Trump's comments followed Rep. Shri Thanedar's announcement of articles of impeachment against him, prompting Rep. Al Green to express support for the effort. Trump accused the Democrats of dishonesty and using impeachment as a weapon, while asserting that Republicans should retaliate by expelling them for their own offenses. He also alluded to alleged past actions by Adam Schiff and the January 6th Committee, claiming they required pardons to avoid expulsion.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, as it participates in a European breeding program. Due to a shortage of female lynxes, the zoo was asked to contribute their one-year-old female, which has been moved to an enclosure in Germany for monitoring. The lynx will be assessed for its survival skills, particularly its ability to avoid human interaction, which is crucial for successful rewilding. Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests, and this effort aims to increase genetic diversity, especially in central Europe, where fragmented habitats have led to inbreeding.</p>

The DNC will organize town halls, encourage voter contact, and use social media to highlight the potential impact of the cuts, particularly on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).

Reindustrialization could also help the left regain working-class voters and offer a way out of neoliberal globalization by rethinking trade, immigration, and economic policies.

          <p>The Atlantic criticizes the recent White House press briefings featuring MAGA-friendly influencers for their lack of journalistic rigor and sycophantic behavior. The author mocks the influencers' softball questions and the administration's use of these briefings to create a "sycophancy Hunger Games." The article contrasts this with the more adversarial relationship between the White House and traditional media, highlighting the influencers' willingness to collude with the administration in exchange for access and flattery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After 100 days in office, Donald Trump's popularity has declined, with the public turning against his policies on the economy, trade, and immigration. His use of tariffs and the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies have faced significant opposition. While some areas, such as border security, initially showed more support, even those have seen a decline. The shift suggests that the public's appetite for major change may be more fickle than initially perceived, and Republicans face challenges in maintaining support before midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Amid labor shortages exacerbated by anti-immigration policies, states like Florida are loosening child labor protections, sparking concerns about the return of "ancient atrocity." These efforts, driven by business lobbying groups and supported by right-wing think tanks, aim to weaken worker rights and erode access to public education. The Trump administration's Project 2025 endorses reducing hazard-work regulations to admit teenage workers, raising alarms among children's advocates. While proponents argue for parental rights and the value of work experience, critics warn of increased workplace injuries and exploitation, highlighting the moral implications of prioritizing labor demand over child safety.</p>

          <p>Christina Li's "The Manor of Dreams" is a gothic novel where two families converge at a crumbling Altadena mansion for the reading of a will, revealing secrets and ghostly encounters. The will of Oscar-winner Vivian Yin leaves her daughters, Lucille and Rennie, with little money but grants the mansion to Elaine, sparking conflict and suspicion. As the families stay in the house, they experience strange occurrences, prompting them to uncover long-held secrets about Vivian's past and their own relationships. While the novel's attempt to link the haunting to the exploitation of Chinese migrants falls short, the story is a compelling exploration of family dynamics, queer romance, and the impact of secrets.</p>

          <p>Nonprofit organizations are working to purchase burned lots in Altadena following the Eaton fire to prevent gentrification and maintain the community's diversity. With many property owners selling to developers after the fire, these nonprofits are stepping in to acquire land, build affordable homes, and sell them to displaced residents. This effort aims to counter the trend of rising home prices and potential displacement of long-standing residents, particularly in the Black community. By providing grants and purchasing properties, these organizations hope to ensure that Altadena remains accessible to its current residents and preserves its unique character.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, according to Eurostat data, failing to meet expectations for a decrease. While core inflation rose to 2.7%, economists suggest that the increase in services inflation may be due to Easter timing effects and expect a decline in the coming months. Despite tariff uncertainty, analysts believe the relatively low headline inflation keeps pressure off the European Central Bank (ECB), allowing for further interest rate cuts. The ECB last cut interest rates in April, lowering its key rate to 2.25%.</p>
