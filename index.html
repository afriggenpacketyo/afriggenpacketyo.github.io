          <p>The offshore yuan has experienced a surge, reaching a six-month high against the US dollar, fueled by growing optimism about a potential thaw in trade relations between the United States and China. Experts suggest that the recent gains are driven by expectations of renewed negotiations and a possible rollback of tariffs. While acknowledging the potential for volatility during negotiations, economists believe that global investors are still cautious and require tangible evidence of China's resilience before increasing their investments in Chinese assets. Despite previous tariff increases, the yuan has shown resilience, and China has been actively promoting the internationalization of its currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists have presented evidence suggesting that "Shi's Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335 BC. The researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, which confirmed the approximate years of observations.

          <p>The Australian film industry is expressing concern over President Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US, with the federal government vowing to defend the sector's rights. Trump cited film incentives offered by other countries as a "National Security threat," claiming they are devastating Hollywood. Australia, a popular location for foreign film productions, offers a 30% rebate for big-budget projects, and industry bodies are assessing the potential impact of the tariffs on the local screen industry, which saw nearly half of its $1.7 billion production spend in 2023-24 come from international projects.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers has revealed that the first roses were likely yellow, challenging the popular association of roses with red and pink colors. The study, which involved a genomic analysis of domesticated and wild rose samples, found that the common ancestor of roses most likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, known as the queen of flowers and a symbol of love and beauty.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Battle of Berlin, which marked the end of Nazi Germany, the city still bears visible scars of the intense fighting, with bullet-riddled facades and gaps in rows of houses. While Berlin has been transformed into a modern capital, the memories of the war remain, with residents recalling constant aerial bombings and the reduction of the city to rubble. The military surrender of Berlin on May 2, 1945, paved the way for Germany's unconditional capitulation and the end of World War II in Europe.</p>

While American companies have largely focused on proprietary AI models, Chinese firms are expanding their influence by freely distributing their models for public use. Apps like Shein, Temu, and TikTok are already among the most downloaded globally, suggesting that China is poised to dominate the next phase of the AI revolution if the US does not act to promote its own computing stack.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking has fallen to fourth among OECD members, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. While the United States remained the top donor, Japan's aid decreased due to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. Japan views ODA as a key diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific, but faces fiscal challenges with its high public debt. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, primarily due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>

The removal of public trash bins in recent years is attributed to safety concerns following terror attacks.
