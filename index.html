          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly criticized Elon Musk, calling him "CRAZY" and suggesting the termination of government contracts for his companies, particularly Tesla and SpaceX, over Musk's opposition to a major tax bill. Musk responded on X, daring Trump to proceed and threatening to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The dispute escalated with Musk accusing Trump of being in the Jeffrey Epstein files and expressing support for his impeachment. This public falling out occurred shortly after a seemingly amicable meeting between the two, highlighting the volatility of their relationship and its potential impact on Musk's business ventures. The stock price of Tesla took a hit after Trump's comments. Optimism in the situation is low considering the public falling out.</p>

          <p>The feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk escalated as Musk accused Trump of "ingratitude" regarding the 2024 election and alleged his presence in the Jeffrey Epstein files. This followed Trump's criticism of Musk's opposition to his "big, beautiful" tax bill, leading to a barrage of social media exchanges. Trump claimed Musk was upset about potential removal of electric vehicle tax credits, while Musk denied prior knowledge of the bill and criticized its impact on the national debt.

          <p>The Trump administration imposed sanctions on four judges from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for what it considers the court's "politicization and abuse of power." The sanctions were issued after the ICC authorized an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and pursued investigations into actions by U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the judges were actively engaged in illegitimate actions targeting the U.S. and Israel, both of which are not party to the Rome Statute that established the ICC. The ICC condemned the sanctions as an attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution, while critics argue the sanctions betray America's commitment to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the attack on a march for Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, was formally charged with 118 state criminal counts, including 28 counts of attempted first-degree murder.

Soliman is being held on a $10 million bond and also faces federal hate crime charges in a separate case. Video evidence appears to show Soliman holding jars containing gasoline during the attack, and he was arrested at the scene without incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed "big, beautiful bill" includes significant cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially affecting millions of Americans. The bill aims to cut around $600 billion from Medicaid, potentially causing 10.9 million people to lose coverage over the next decade, and $230 billion from SNAP over 10 years. Republicans argue these cuts will reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" and fund Trump's tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense. Changes to Medicaid include new work requirements, increased eligibility checks, and prohibitions on funding for undocumented migrants, abortion providers, and gender transition care. The potential impact on vulnerable populations raises concerns about access to healthcare and food assistance.</p>

Despite a rise in first-quarter revenue, Lululemon expects lower full-year gross margins due to increased tariffs, reflecting broader challenges faced by retailers navigating the current economic climate.

Khalil's legal team submitted the declaration as evidence in support of his request for a preliminary injunction seeking his immediate release. They argue that his arrest and detention are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to suppress constitutionally protected speech. Khalil had accepted a position at Oxfam International before his arrest, but the offer was rescinded due to the government's accusations against him, highlighting the personal and professional impact of his detention.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel is arming clans in the Gaza Strip to combat Hamas, following a leak by right-wing lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman. Netanyahu stated that this move would help save the lives of Israeli soldiers. Lieberman claimed that the Israeli government is providing weapons to a group of criminals identified with Islamic State, a claim that has not been substantiated. One of the recipients of Israeli support is reportedly a gang leader accused of looting U.N. aid convoys, raising concerns about the distribution of aid and the potential for further instability in Gaza. The move is a controversial strategy.</p>

Unite, the union representing the workers, stated that 97% of those who voted backed continued strike action, with a 75% turnout. The union is demanding that Birmingham City Council put forward an acceptable offer to resolve the dispute. The council claims it has made a fair and reasonable offer and remains committed to finding a resolution, but the union says the offer was not in line with previous discussions.

          <p>President Donald Trump confused German Chancellor Friedrich Merz during a White House meeting by describing D-Day as "not a great day." Merz clarified that D-Day was the liberation of Germany from Nazi dictatorship, emphasizing the importance of the event for his country. The exchange occurred during a discussion about the war in Ukraine, with Merz drawing parallels to World War II and urging continued American support. The incident highlighted differing perspectives on historical events and the ongoing importance of the U.S.-German relationship in addressing global challenges.

The order includes an exception for athletes and support staff traveling for major sporting events but leaves unclear whether the Club World Cup and Gold Cup qualify.

          <p>NATO defense ministers showed broad support for a historic increase in defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of gross domestic product, in response to the growing threat from Russia and a more dangerous global environment. The proposed investment plan includes allocating 3.5% of GDP to core defense spending and 1.5% to defense- and security-related investments. This move comes after months of pressure from the U.S. President Donald Trump for allies to significantly increase their military spending. While most NATO countries currently meet the 2% threshold, some still fall short, raising questions about how they will achieve the higher spending goal amid economic challenges.</p>
