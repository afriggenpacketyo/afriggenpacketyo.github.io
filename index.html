Timpson, formerly CEO of the Timpson Group known for hiring ex-offenders, acknowledges the 'crisis' state of prisons with overcrowding and limited spare capacity. He also addressed the increasing violence in prisons and the challenges posed by serious organized crime, stressing the importance of rehabilitation to reduce re-offending rates.</p>

While Christie's family estate approved the project and stipulated that only her words be used, some experts argue that it still constitutes a 'deepfake' since Christie herself cannot consent. The course utilizes academic research and a 'digital prosthetic' to create an avatar, not to invent her views.

These findings, published in Science Bulletin, aim to inform landing site selection and design for China's proposed lunar research base.

The ruling came after lawyers filed an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing both press reports and accounts from migrants. The judge clarified that any imminent removals to these countries would defy the preliminary injunction he issued last month, which bars deporting noncitizens to countries other than their place of origin without due process.
