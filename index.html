          <p>A 60-year-old ultrarunner from Michigan, Elaine Stypula, tragically died after collapsing during the Hardrock Hundred, a 102.5-mile endurance race in Colorado's San Juan Mountains. The incident occurred just three hours into the race on a high mountain trail. Despite a rapid response from race safety personnel, local rescue teams, and a Flight For Life helicopter, resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful.

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship, decisively defeating American Amanda Anisimova in the women's final. The match was remarkably one-sided, with Swiatek winning in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0, in under an hour. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth major trophy, adding a grass-court Grand Slam to her previous wins on clay and hard courts. For Anisimova, reaching the final was a significant achievement after taking a career break in 2023 to focus on her mental health.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, he cited persistent trade deficits with the EU and insufficient border control efforts by Mexico as justifications. The announcement has prompted concern from European leaders, with the EU stating it will take necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including potential countermeasures. This move marks a significant escalation in trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A portion of Southern Boulevard in Florida, a key route leading to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, is set to be renamed in his honor. Palm Beach County commissioners unanimously approved the measure to change the name to "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The roadway is frequently used by Trump's motorcade and lined by his supporters during his visits. This honor follows a tradition in the county, which already has roads named after former presidents George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, some companies are utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to mitigate the financial impact of tariffs. These zones allow businesses to import materials and components duty-free, with taxes only being applied once the finished products enter U.S. commerce. This strategy provides significant cash flow benefits by delaying or reducing duty payments. However, a recent executive order by President Trump eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit for FTZs, which previously allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on finished goods, complicating this approach for manufacturers.

Musk believes capturing a small number of congressional seats could give the party decisive influence on legislation. However, political science experts are skeptical, arguing that third parties in the U.S. rarely succeed in winning seats due to the entrenched two-party system. They suggest that third parties are more effective at disrupting the status quo and pressuring major parties on specific issues rather than gaining direct power.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, posing a significant challenge to long-held U.S. leadership in the field. The country aims to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development. While NASA's Artemis program officially targets an earlier moon landing, it faces significant technical hurdles, such as the need for in-orbit refueling. This intensifying space race has prompted the U.S. to increase funding for its own lunar exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>A personal essay reflects on the complex and often contradictory state of transgender visibility and rights in the United States. The author notes that while public representation of trans people has grown, there is a concurrent and powerful political backlash, including laws targeting gender-affirming care for minors. Drawing on personal experience, the author argues against delaying transition, countering the idea with the concept of "survivorship bias." The piece suggests that much of the debate is fueled by doubt and fear, similar to controversies around climate change or vaccines.</p>

          <p>Russia has continued its intensified bombing campaign across Ukraine, launching hundreds of drones and cruise missiles that killed at least six people overnight and into Saturday morning. Attacks were reported in multiple regions, from Chernivtsi and Lviv in the west to Kharkiv in the northeast. Ukraine's air force stated that it shot down a significant number of the projectiles, but falling debris and direct hits still caused casualties and damage. The escalating long-range attacks coincide with severe pressure on Ukrainian troops along the front line.</p>

Health officials did not release further details about the victim.

Pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs, is the most virulent and easily spread form of the disease. Most U.S. cases occur in rural areas of western and southwestern states.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by former President Trump, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," significantly overhauls the federal student loan system. The legislation reduces the number of repayment plan options from seven to two: a standard plan and a new income-driven plan. It also introduces new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans, and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants. For millions of borrowers, this means navigating yet another major shift in federal policy, with changes set to be phased in starting in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
