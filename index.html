          <p>A passenger plane crash in Russia's remote Amur region has resulted in the deaths of all 48 people on board, including five children. The Angara Airlines An-24 aircraft, reportedly almost 50 years old, disappeared from radar while traveling from Blagoveshchensk to Tynda. Rescue teams located the burning wreckage in a forested area, with adverse weather conditions cited as a possible factor in the incident. Russian authorities have opened a criminal investigation into potential flight safety violations, a standard procedure in such events, highlighting ongoing concerns about aviation safety in the country.</p>

          <p>Significant military clashes have erupted along the border between Thailand and Cambodia, resulting in at least 12 deaths, primarily civilians on the Thai side. The conflict escalated with both nations employing small arms, artillery, and rockets, and Thailand conducting airstrikes on what it identified as Cambodian military targets. Tensions flared after a mine explosion injured Thai soldiers, leading to a diplomatic fallout and the sealing of border crossings. Both countries have accused each other of initiating the aggression, with Cambodia requesting an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to address the situation.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has disclosed that it is cooperating with a Department of Justice investigation into its Medicare billing practices. The probe, which includes both criminal and civil inquiries, is examining whether the company inflated diagnoses to receive higher payments from the Medicare Advantage program. In response, UnitedHealth has initiated an independent third-party review of its policies and expressed confidence in its practices, citing internal audits. This development adds to a series of challenges for the healthcare giant, which has faced a difficult year marked by rising costs and a major cyberattack. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study published in The Lancet Public Health indicates that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. This finding presents a more attainable goal for many people compared to the widely promoted but less evidence-based 10,000-step benchmark. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, finding that even modest increases in daily steps provide significant health benefits compared to being sedentary. The study suggests this simple metric could be a practical addition to public health guidelines to encourage daily physical activity.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged by 18%, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge is attributed to high short interest and a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, which has drawn attention from retail traders on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This phenomenon, where investors coordinate to drive up the price of heavily shorted stocks, has recently affected other brands like GoPro and Krispy Kreme. The rally offers a temporary reprieve for American Eagle's stock, which had fallen significantly year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Airlines has revised its 2025 profit forecast downward and issued a third-quarter outlook that falls below analyst expectations, causing its shares to decline. The airline's CEO attributed the weaker performance to a slowdown in domestic consumer demand, stagnant corporate travel, and operational disruptions from severe weather. While international travel remains a bright spot, the carrier's domestic passenger revenue has notably decreased. This adjustment follows similar moves by competitors like Delta and United, signaling broader challenges within the U.S. aviation industry as it navigates a complex economic landscape.

          <p>An increasing number of Americans are experiencing what is described as "citizenship insecurity," a sense of disillusionment and estrangement from their country's values, particularly since the 2024 election. This feeling is not necessarily about immediate physical danger but a profound disconnect with the nation's political direction and the erosion of democratic ideals. The article explores this phenomenon through personal anecdotes, including individuals seeking second passports and academics considering opportunities abroad.

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has been left out of the squad for the team's pre-season tour of Asia, fueling speculation about his potential departure from the club. While the official reason given for his absence is a minor thigh injury, reports suggest the player has expressed a desire to explore a move this summer, with Liverpool reportedly still interested. Manager Eddie Howe had recently stated his confidence that Isak would remain with the club. The omission of the team's star striker from a commercially important tour has raised concerns among fans about his future.</p>

          <p>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has officially announced the launch of a new political party, co-founded with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. In a statement, they called for a "real, democratic alternative" to the current political system, which they described as "rigged." The new party, which is not yet registered with the Electoral Commission, aims to stand candidates in local elections and advocates for policies such as wealth redistribution, nationalization of key industries, and an end to arms sales to Israel. This move formalizes a split on the left of British politics.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned meeting between Ghislaine Maxwell and the Department of Justice, a 2022 sentencing memorandum from federal prosecutors provides a stark assessment of her character. The document described Maxwell as engaging in a "significant pattern of dishonest conduct" and exhibiting a complete failure to accept responsibility for her "monstrous" crimes in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. Prosecutors argued she was a vital participant who identified, groomed, and abused victims while personally profiting from her relationship with Epstein. This past assessment casts doubt on her credibility as the DOJ now seeks her cooperation.</p>

According to the mine operator, Newmont Corp, the workers were able to move to a designated refuge station after an initial ground collapse. This refuge area is reportedly supplied with enough food, water, and ventilation to sustain them for an extended period. A subsequent collapse has blocked their exit, and communication has been limited, prompting a full stand-down of operations at the mine while the rescue is conducted.</p>

Analysts believe the market has priced in mid-teen tariff rates, but uncertainty persists over who will ultimately bear the cost—consumers, corporations, or international suppliers.

          <p>The White House has imposed a 17 percent tariff on tomatoes imported from Mexico, a move that is expected to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers.

While the tariffs are intended to protect American growers in places like Florida, agricultural economists argue that the U.S. cannot cost-effectively supply the entire country year-round.
