          <p>A preliminary investigation into last month's Air India crash, which killed 270 people, indicates the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were moved to the "CUTOFF" position just seconds after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had hit the switch, with the other denying he had done so. Although fuel flow was restored seconds later, there was insufficient time to prevent the Boeing 787 from crashing into a building. The incident claimed the lives of all but one person on board and several people on the ground.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people are using artificial intelligence tools to improve their online dating experiences, with nearly half of Gen Z singles utilizing AI for assistance. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer services that help users craft witty messages, navigate conversations, and even handle difficult situations like ghosting. These AI dating assistants act as a digital 'wingman,' providing objective advice and boosting confidence for those who struggle with writing. While some users find the technology helpful for initiating conversations, experts caution against over-reliance, stressing that AI should supplement, not replace, genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>In the wake of catastrophic flash floods in the Texas Hill Country that have left over 120 people dead and dozens missing, numerous organizations are mobilizing to provide relief. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River rise 26 feet in 45 minutes, washed away homes and devastated a summer camp. In response, groups like the Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, the American Red Cross, and Mercy Chefs are collecting donations to support rescue operations, provide meals, and offer medical supplies. Corporations such as Walmart and H-E-B have also launched campaigns to assist the affected communities.</p>

          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has condemned the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), calling the effects devastating but reversible. The administration placed USAID staff on leave and absorbed the agency into the State Department, leading to reported shortages of essential medical supplies in Africa, including HIV medication for children. Gates highlighted that these abrupt cuts have already led to deaths by interrupting medical trials and supply chains. The move is part of broader reductions in foreign aid, including funding for global vaccine and AIDS relief programs.</p>

However, these collectors and the wine collateral allegedly did not exist.

The disaster occurred when the Guadalupe River rose dramatically, catching many residents and summer camps by surprise in the middle of the night.

A proposed ordinance would require agents to be clearly identified during operations, but the council has delayed a decision for a month to study the issue, drawing criticism for not treating it as an emergency.

Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, matching the U.S. tariff rate. This development risks a trade war between the two nations and marks a new front where Trump is using trade policy to influence the domestic affairs of another country. (not investment advice)</p>

The court ruled that the Secretary of Defense had the authority to overrule the agreement. This ruling prolongs the more than two-decade-long military prosecution and means the case will likely proceed toward a trial, leaving victims' families divided on the path to justice.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, including the 7/7 London bombings and the controversial fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by police. Blair's career was cut short when he was forced to resign by then-mayor Boris Johnson. Current Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley remembered Blair as one of the most influential police leaders of recent decades, praising his vast contributions to policing and victim services.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions against journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations, which argued that police were deliberately targeting and injuring reporters during recent demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The judge's order prohibits the use of such force against journalists who are not posing an imminent threat and bars police from obstructing reporters who are gathering information for the public.</p>

          <p>The proliferation of generative AI is creating new challenges for recent college graduates seeking entry-level corporate jobs. According to career platform Handshake, listings for such roles have fallen by 15%, while applications per job have surged by 30%. Experts note that AI is increasingly capable of handling the rote, repetitive tasks often assigned to junior employees, leading to a redefinition of entry-level positions. While not a collapse, this trend signals a difficult job market for young professionals, particularly in fields like computer science where growth was previously expected to be constant.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have filed a civil lawsuit against prominent Georgia Republican Brant Frost IV, alleging he operated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors out of at least $140 million. The SEC complaint claims Frost's company, First Liberty Building and Loan, lied about making high-interest loans and instead used new investor money to pay earlier ones. Frost is accused of personally taking over $19 million from the fund for personal expenses, including jewelry, rare coins, and political contributions. The collapse of the business has sent shockwaves through the religious and political networks from which it drew investors.</p>

Hardin escaped wearing a makeshift law enforcement uniform crafted from inmate clothing and a soup can lid. Although officials said there was no evidence of intentional assistance, lawmakers criticized the escape as indicative of deeper systemic problems within the corrections facility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, effective August 1, escalating trade tensions between the two countries. In a letter, Trump linked the proposed tariffs to what he called Canada's failure to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., as well as existing Canadian levies on U.S. dairy and the bilateral trade deficit. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney responded that his government will continue to protect its workers and businesses. This threat is part of a broader tariff strategy by the Trump administration targeting multiple trade partners. (not investment advice)</p>

The raids are part of an increase in federal immigration enforcement in the region, stoking fear in immigrant communities and raising questions about labor practices at the licensed facilities.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is set to lose its spot in the Europa League to Nottingham Forest due to UEFA's multi-club ownership regulations. The issue stems from John Textor's 43% stake in Palace and his ownership of French club Lyon, which also qualified for the tournament. UEFA has deemed that Textor's involvement constitutes a conflict, and since Lyon finished higher in their respective league, they retain their spot. Palace, who believed they had earned their first-ever European qualification, missed a key deadline to alter their ownership structure and are now expected to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>

The letter, from Senators Jim Banks and Elizabeth Warren, urges Huang to refrain from meeting with Chinese companies suspected of undermining U.S. export controls or collaborating with China's military and intelligence services. Lawmakers expressed concern that the trip could legitimize entities that threaten U.S. national security and involve discussions about exploitable gaps in export regulations. This comes as Nvidia plans to launch a cheaper version of its advanced AI chips specifically for the Chinese market.</p>
