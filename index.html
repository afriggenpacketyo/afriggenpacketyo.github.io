          <p>China is poised to deploy its FH-97 stealth drone, a single-engine, ground-attack uncrewed aircraft, potentially making it the first nation with a combat-ready "loyal wingman" for coordinated aerial warfare. Leaked photos from a recent military parade rehearsal suggest its official debut is imminent, highlighting its advanced design features. Developed by a state-owned aerospace corporation, this drone's readiness marks a significant advancement in China's military technology. Its capability to operate alongside crewed jets could redefine modern aerial combat tactics, positioning China as a leading force in autonomous defense systems. This development could reshape global military dynamics and prompt other nations to accelerate their own drone programs.</p>

          <p>The Royal Mint is releasing the final £1 coins bearing Queen Elizabeth II's likeness, dated 2021 and 2022, marking a pivotal moment in British coinage. Over 23 million of these are entering circulation, alongside 7.5 million new King Charles III coins, which feature an intricate bee design symbolizing his connection to nature. This release physically represents the monarchy's transition, with both monarchs' coins remaining legal tender for decades. The 2022 Elizabeth II coins are set to become the rarest in circulation, potentially sparking a new collecting interest. This shift reflects a broader redesign of UK currency, incorporating flora and fauna.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reveals that smartphones track user locations extensively, beyond just GPS, by leveraging cell towers, Wi-Fi networks, and Bluetooth beacons, even through background pings. It provides practical steps for users to manage and limit this pervasive data collection. iPhone users are instructed on how to access and clear the "Significant Locations" log and adjust individual app permissions to "While Using" or "Never." Android users can manage their "Timeline" data within Google Maps and refine app location settings. The article emphasizes that even with these adjustments, cellular carriers still track device location, advising power-off or airplane mode for complete privacy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has proposed a significant overhaul of type 2 diabetes care in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, advocating for more personalized treatment and increased access to newer medications, including weight-loss drugs. This "biggest shake-up in a decade" aims to prevent severe complications like heart disease and strokes, reduce NHS costs, and potentially save lives. The guidance recommends SGLT-2 inhibitors as a first-choice treatment for all patients, with around 2.3 million people becoming eligible. Additionally, approximately 750,000 more individuals with type 2 diabetes, particularly those with cardiovascular disease or early onset, could be offered GLP-1 agonists. This move seeks to address existing health inequalities in drug access.</p>

          <p>Walmart has issued a recall for specific Great Value frozen shrimp products across 13 U.S. states, following a warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding potential radioactive contamination. The FDA reported that one sample of breaded shrimp tested positive for Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, although this particular sample did not reach consumers. The contamination source is an Indonesian supplier whose containers have since been blocked from entering the U.S. While the detected level of Cesium-137 is not immediately life-threatening, prolonged exposure could elevate cancer risks. Walmart assures customers that their health and safety are top priorities, offering full refunds for recalled items.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm but continues to pose a significant threat to the East Coast with dangerous rip currents and high waves. While not expected to make direct U.S. landfall, coastal flooding has prompted mandatory evacuation orders for North Carolina's Outer Banks, with conditions expected to worsen mid-week. The storm's large size means hurricane-force winds extend widely, impacting a broad area from South Florida to New England. Officials are urging people to heed local warnings and avoid ocean activities due to life-threatening conditions, emphasizing the storm's potential for severe disruption and property damage.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a significant 2.6% year-over-year decline in July, marking their steepest drop in over four years, primarily driven by reduced shipments to its two largest markets, the United States and China. This contraction surpassed economists' forecasts, raising concerns despite stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter. A substantial 28.4% plunge in auto exports to the U.S. contributed significantly to the overall decline. While a recent trade deal with Washington lowered tariffs on automobiles, its full impact is yet to be seen. Analysts are now cautioning about the possibility of Japan entering a recession, depending on the sustained effects of these trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

However, a prominent space scientist expressed concerns that this move could lead to short-term disruption and a long-term decline in the UK's competitive standing in the global space sector. The agency, founded in 2010, has been instrumental in the UK's advancements in small spacecraft and satellite development, contributing significantly to the economy.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the entire U.S. southern border wall will be painted black, a measure directly requested by President Trump. The rationale is that the black paint will make the metal hotter in high temperatures, thereby making the wall more difficult to climb and discouraging illegal immigration. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks also noted that the paint would serve an additional benefit by deterring rust. This initiative is a component of the Trump administration's ongoing hardline immigration policies, supported by substantial new funding from Congress to complete the border barrier.

The defense points out that the charges were brought only after his return and questions the credibility of a key government witness.

The area, once defined by its coal industry, now thrives on outdoor tourism, offering a diverse range of activities including whitewater rafting, rock climbing, mountain biking, and even annual bridge base jumping.

Potential measures include policing Ukraine's airspace and the Black Sea, with crucial U.S. involvement. On land, military support would likely involve training, intelligence, and continued arms supply, as direct troop deployment is strongly opposed by Russia and considered impractical.

          <h2>England's Empty Homes Crisis: A Missed Opportunity to Alleviate Housing Shortages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 19:08:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England is grappling with a significant empty homes crisis, with nearly 720,000 vacant properties, including 265,000 long-term empty homes, existing amidst a severe national housing shortage and increasing homelessness. This article investigates why these properties are not being utilized to alleviate the housing crunch. It attributes the rise in long-term empty homes to the government's cessation of effective funding schemes in 2016, which shifted the burden solely to local councils. While some councils offer grants or loans, their uptake remains low, and legal enforcement is often costly and time-consuming. Experts propose diverse solutions, ranging from tax relief for buyers to improved data collection on empty properties, acknowledging the complex reasons for vacancies, such as lengthy probate processes or untraceable owners.</p>

          <p>North Hollywood's Valley Plaza, once a vibrant commercial center that even hosted John F. Kennedy, has received approval for demolition after years of severe blight, crime, and neglect. A panel of Los Angeles city commissioners declared six buildings on the site a public nuisance, clearing the path for their removal. The sprawling property had become an eyesore, a drain on city police and fire resources, and a location for dystopian film sets. Local leaders express hope that this demolition will facilitate new residential and retail development in the "phenomenal location," aiming to revitalize the area and recover lost retail tax revenue. The former owner was criticized for neglecting the property.</p>

          <p>A television advertisement for Sanex shower gel has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for reinforcing a racial stereotype. The ad depicted models with dark skin as having cracked or itchy skin, using bright graphics, followed by a white woman whose skin appeared smooth and problem-free after using the product. The ASA ruled that this visual comparison could be interpreted as suggesting white skin was superior to black skin, despite Colgate-Palmolive's stated intention to promote diversity and illustrate "before and after" scenarios. The ruling underscores the critical importance for advertisers to avoid inadvertently causing serious offense on the grounds of race in future campaigns, even if the messaging was not intentionally discriminatory.</p>

          <p>California is developing new strategies to accelerate zero-emission vehicle adoption after the Trump administration nullified federal tax credits and key state auto-emission standards, including the 2035 ban on new gas-only cars. Governor Gavin Newsom's executive order has tasked state agencies with creating policies to counteract these federal rollbacks and ensure California meets its ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets and air quality standards. A recent report suggests restoring state subsidies for EVs, potentially funded by the state's cap-and-trade program, and exploring other financial inducements like reduced toll lane costs. The state also plans to lead by example with its own vehicle fleet and continue legal challenges, signaling its unwavering commitment to environmental leadership despite federal antagonism.

The bus, transporting migrants who had been compelled to leave Iran, collided with a motorcycle and then a fuel truck before erupting in flames. This devastating incident underscores the severe humanitarian crisis faced by a vast number of Afghans returning from neighboring countries, often under duress from host nations. According to the UN, over 1.2 million Afghans have either voluntarily returned or been forcibly repatriated from Iran and Pakistan this year alone, highlighting a critical and ongoing regional challenge.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has launched an investigation into allegations that Washington D.C. police falsified crime data, with President Trump claiming the city created a "false illusion of safety" to counter his narrative of widespread lawlessness. This probe occurs amidst the President's ongoing federal takeover of law enforcement in D.C. However, recent data indicates a significant decline in violent crime in D.C., consistent with a broader national trend towards the lowest murder rates since 1960. While isolated concerns about data manipulation have arisen, evidence of a systemic issue remains limited. The article suggests the DOJ's investigation and National Guard deployments are largely politically motivated, with federal agents primarily focused on tourist areas rather than addressing violent crime.</p>

          <p>Rangers endured a mortifying 1-3 defeat to Club Brugge in the Champions League, exposing significant defensive frailties under manager Russell Martin. Early goals conceded highlighted the team's lack of defensive discipline and physical strength, despite having previously survived similar issues in earlier ties. While the team displayed offensive promise, particularly through player Djeidi Gassama, their defensive vulnerabilities were mercilessly exploited by a fluid Club Brugge side. This result strongly suggests that Rangers are not yet prepared for the demands of Champions League football and places considerable pressure on Martin to adjust his predominantly attacking strategy. The article anticipates a challenging series of upcoming fixtures for the team.</p>

This criticism echoes his previous executive order targeting the Smithsonian for promoting "divisive ideology." Critics widely condemned his remarks, arguing that they represent an attempt to revise accurate historical representation.
