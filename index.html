          <p>A software engineer from India, Soham Parekh, gained notoriety after being exposed for simultaneously working for multiple tech startups. Founders of companies like Playground AI and Antimetal shared their experiences, noting fluctuations in his work quality and availability. Parekh later admitted to working up to 140 hours a week, citing "extremely dire financial circumstances" rather than greed as his motivation. The incident has ignited a debate within the tech community about the extremes of hustle culture, remote work exploitation, and the ethics of being "overemployed."</p>

          <p>Devastating floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 50 fatalities, with a search operation underway for 27 girls still missing from a Christian summer camp. The camp, located on the banks of the Guadalupe River, was inundated when the river rose dramatically after months' worth of rain fell in hours. Rescue crews are scouring the region for survivors, but officials face difficult conditions and an unknown number of unaccounted-for individuals. The tragedy has raised questions about the adequacy of flood warnings and preparedness in the vulnerable "Flash Flood Alley" region.</p>

The all-girls' Camp Mystic was reportedly "completely destroyed" by the deluge, which saw the Guadalupe River rise 26 feet in under an hour. Despite the National Weather Service issuing increasingly dire alerts, including a "particularly dangerous situation" warning, the suddenness and scale of the flood caught many, including local officials, by surprise, leading to questions about why riverside camps were not evacuated sooner.</p>

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of hairstylist Fabio Sementilli, asserted that his former lover and the victim's wife, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker, sentenced to life without parole, told a "48 Hours" producer that Monica "didn't know s***" and would have turned him in sooner if she had. This claim comes as Monica Sementilli faces her own trial for conspiracy to commit murder. Baker's potential testimony could be a bombshell in her case, though legal experts are circumspect about its impact on a jury.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in the Fabio Sementilli murder case are using evidence of an ongoing jailhouse romance between the victim's wife, Monica, and her lover, Robert Baker, to argue for a committed murder conspiracy. Intercepted letters and secret recordings allegedly reveal the couple used coded language, referred to themselves as husband and wife, and maintained a "Ride or Die" pact. Police conducted elaborate sting operations, including placing them in adjoining cells, to capture their interactions. The prosecution contends this evidence demonstrates their continued commitment not just to each other, but to a secrecy pact surrounding the murder of Monica's husband.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have demonstrated that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is widely believed to enhance the brain's information processing capabilities. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that this genetic influence extends across various scales, from individual brain regions to large networks. The team also established a link between this criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting a shared genetic foundation and opening new avenues for understanding brain function and dysfunction.</p>

Prosecutors had dropped the initial charges against him in 2022 right before trial, citing the need to find Suzanne's body and after a judge excluded key evidence.

The defense argued Morphew was innocent and that prosecutors were "manufacturing a murder case" without physical evidence.

New evidence reveals MI5 continued to provide misleading information and withheld key documents during its internal reviews.

          <h2>Elon Musk Announces Formation of New "America Party" Following Split with Trump</h2>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party, the "America Party," positioning it as a challenge to the traditional two-party system in the U.S. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a very public falling out with President Donald Trump. Musk, who had been a key financial backer and appointee in the Trump administration, recently left his role after criticizing the president's tax and spending plans. It remains unclear if the party has been formally registered or who will lead it, as Musk is ineligible to run for president himself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to roll out "Best Start" family hubs to every local authority in England by 2026. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of support services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The initiative builds on the previous "Sure Start" centers and is intended to support 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. While the government says the hubs will provide a "lifeline," the opposition has questioned how much of the plan is new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>

          <p>At least 50 people have been confirmed dead across central Texas following catastrophic flash floods, with dozens still missing from a children's summer camp in Kerr County. Fatalities have been reported in Kerr, Travis, Burnet, and Tom Green counties after the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration, and officials report that over 850 people have been rescued, some from treetops. Local officials expressed shock at the flood's ferocity, noting that while rain was expected, its unprecedented intensity was not forecasted, overwhelming local preparedness.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant but short performance on the mound, pitching two scoreless innings and striking out the side in the second against the Houston Astros. However, the Dodgers' bullpen could not maintain the momentum, with long reliever Justin Wrobleski giving up five runs. Despite home runs from Mookie Betts and Miguel Rojas, the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome the deficit, ultimately losing the game 6-4. The loss clinches a series defeat for the Dodgers and highlights the team's ongoing reliance on a tenuous pitching depth as they await the return of injured starters.</p>

          <h2>New Communist Party Regulations Suggest Xi Jinping May Be Delegating More Authority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 22:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Communist Party has issued new regulations for its top policy coordination bodies, which some analysts interpret as a sign that President Xi Jinping is delegating more power to his deputies. The new rules aim to standardize the work of central commissions and leading groups, which have expanded under Xi's tenure. According to state media, the Politburo emphasized that these bodies should focus on high-level planning and oversight of major national matters. The move is seen by some as an effort to streamline governance and could potentially hint at long-term succession planning.</p>

          <p>An officer with the Los Angeles Police Department is in serious but stable condition after being shot during a foot pursuit in the Exposition Park area. The incident occurred when two officers from a gang enforcement detail attempted to stop and question a suspect, who then fled. During the chase, the suspect turned and fired, striking one officer. The second officer returned fire, and the suspect was arrested without being hit. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell stated the wounded officer's injuries are considered non-life-threatening.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their opening game of the California Classic summer league to the Golden State Warriors, 89-84, after surrendering a double-digit lead. Cole Swider was a standout performer for the Lakers, scoring 24 points, while DJ Steward added 20. However, the team struggled defensively in the second half, and last season's first-round pick, Dalton Knecht, had a difficult shooting night. Bronny James, the team's high-profile rookie, traveled with the team but did not play in the opening contest.</p>
