          <h2>Volkswagen Lowers Financial Outlook After Tariffs Impact Second-Quarter Profits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 04:10:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volkswagen has reduced its full-year guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, largely attributing the decline to the impact of U.S. tariffs and restructuring costs. The German automaker now forecasts a lower operating return on sales for 2025 and expects full-year sales to be flat compared to previous growth projections. Company officials noted that while product sales, especially for electric vehicles, remain strong in Europe, the financial performance has been significantly hampered by external economic pressures and the lower profit margins on EVs. The firm anticipates continued challenges from U.S. trade policies in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Landmark Recall Vote in Taiwan Could Reshape Political Landscape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 04:08:03 EDT</div>

          <p>Taiwan is holding an unprecedented mass recall vote targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, a move that could shift control of the legislature back to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The recall campaign, driven by pro-DPP groups, accuses the KMT members of being too close to Beijing, framing the vote as a test of anti-Beijing sentiment on the island. Analysts suggest the outcome will have significant repercussions for Taiwan's political trajectory, influencing future local and presidential elections. The vote is seen as a critical test of whether the "resist China, protect Taiwan" narrative remains the dominant political force in the self-governed democracy.</p>

          <p>A senior U.S. Justice Department official conducted a day-long interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's associate who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. Maxwell's lawyer described the meeting as "very productive," stating she answered all questions posed to her regarding any information she might have about others involved in Epstein's crimes. The interview comes amid growing public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to the Epstein case. The development has drawn criticism from Democrats over a potential conflict of interest, as the interviewing official is a former personal lawyer for President Trump.</p>

          <p>This article examines several prevalent narratives surrounding the WNBA, particularly in the era of Caitlin Clark, to separate truth from fiction. It assesses whether Clark's All-Star vote ranking was appropriate, concluding that while fan votes were high, player and media votes reflected her current effectiveness more accurately compared to other stars. The analysis argues that the league is not overly dependent on Clark, pointing to rising attendance and the emergence of other young talents like Paige Bueckers and JuJu Watkins. It also refutes the idea that a lack of dunking holds the league back, highlighting superior fundamentals like free-throw shooting and a higher rate of assisted field goals compared to the NBA.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to keep disruption to a minimum as resident doctors in England commence a five-day strike over pay. Unlike previous walkouts that prioritized only emergency care, NHS England has instructed hospitals to try to maintain non-urgent services as well, with senior doctors providing cover. The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned this approach could stretch staff too thinly and risk patient safety. Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized the BMA for "rushing" into the strike, which he stated would set back progress made in rebuilding the NHS, while the union maintains the action was necessary to restore pay eroded by inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.9% in June, marking a rebound from a significant drop in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. The increase was largely attributed to record-warm weather, which boosted supermarket sales of drinks and summer clothing, as well as fuel sales as more people traveled. Despite the monthly rise, the overall trend suggests that growth in retail spending has slowed, with only a 0.2% increase in the second quarter compared to the first. This modest rebound aligns with other data indicating weaker consumer confidence, suggesting that broader economic growth for the quarter was likely lackluster. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, this analysis identifies key tactical areas that could decide the match. A crucial strategy for England will be exploiting Spain's high defensive line, which leaves considerable space for forwards like Alessia Russo to operate in. To succeed, England's attack must be more connected and provide better support for Russo. In midfield, the Lionesses face the challenge of neutralizing Spain's talented playmakers, Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas, by staying compact and cutting off passing lanes. The article suggests that while Spain will likely dominate possession, England is well-suited to play a transitional game and can draw lessons from Germany's semi-final performance against the world champions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts includes an informal meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which presents an opportunity to refine the recent US-UK trade agreement. While a deal was initiated in June, key elements, such as the removal of a 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum, remain at the commitment stage. Another contentious issue is the UK's digital services tax, which Washington wants eliminated. Analysts suggest there may be a trade-off where the US reduces metal tariffs in exchange for the UK dropping the tech tax, providing a positive development for UK-US relations ahead of a wider August 1 tariff deadline.

          <p>With an August 1 deadline approaching for a trade deal with the U.S. before tariffs increase, India appears unfazed, according to analysts. New Delhi's confidence stems from its strategic importance to Washington as a counterbalance to China, both economically and within the BRICS group of emerging economies. India has demonstrated its willingness to protect sensitive sectors, such as agriculture, in other trade pacts and is expected to do the same with the U.S. Analysts believe the Trump administration has a strong interest in securing a deal to further its goal of shifting global manufacturing away from China, giving India significant leverage in the negotiations.

          <h2>Mexican Ranchers Face Growing Crisis from Flesh-Eating Screwworm Parasite in Livestock</h2>

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to combat a spreading infestation of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that infects livestock. The rapid spread in the state of Chiapas has caught many off guard, leading the U.S. to bar imports of Mexican cattle over fears the parasite could move north. While a U.S.-supported plant to produce sterile flies to combat the pest is under construction, it will not be ready until next year, leaving ranchers to face soaring medicine prices and resort to home remedies. The crisis poses a significant economic threat, as any open wound on an animal can become a breeding ground for the fly's maggots.</p>

          <p>In a UK first, the Welsh government will provide people with coeliac disease and other gluten intolerances with pre-loaded debit cards to purchase food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of receiving select gluten-free items on prescription from a pharmacy. The card will function like a standard bank card and can be used in supermarkets, shops, and online, giving individuals more choice and control. While the move is intended to "de-medicalise" the process, some participants from a pilot scheme noted that the monthly allowance only "scratches the surface" of the higher cost of a gluten-free diet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is visiting Scotland to open a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort and visit his Turnberry property, a trip that critics note publicly blends his presidential office with his personal business interests. The White House has confirmed that during the visit, Trump will also meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss trade and with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney. The trip has drawn scrutiny, with observers pointing out the unusual nature of a sitting U.S. president using their time in office to promote private enterprises, especially amid major global crises. A large security operation is in place, with protests expected.</p>

          <p>The United States has cut short its participation in Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar, with President Trump's special envoy stating that the negotiating team is returning home to consider "alternative options." The U.S. accused Hamas of not appearing to be coordinated or acting in good faith, with its latest response showing a "lack of desire" to reach a truce. This move represents a significant setback in the 21-month effort to broker a deal to end the war and secure the release of hostages. Hamas expressed surprise at the U.S. remarks, stating it had shown responsibility and flexibility and remained keen to continue negotiations.</p>

          <p>At a business symposium with European Union leaders, Chinese Premier Li Qiang stressed that cooperation is the "only right choice" for China-EU relations. He called for a "healthy" economic relationship that includes both competition and collaboration, suggesting the two sides could leverage their complementary strengths in areas like services trade and the green economy. Li's remarks come amid a backdrop of rising global protectionism. He positioned a strong China-EU partnership as a stabilizing anchor for the global economy and supply chains, urging both to join hands in upholding free trade and multilateralism.

          <p>At least six children have been killed and dozens more were injured after the roof of a government school partially collapsed in India's western state of Rajasthan. The incident occurred on Friday morning while approximately 40 children and staff were inside the one-story building. Eyewitnesses reported that the building was in a dilapidated state and that the roof caved in following several days of persistent, heavy rainfall. State officials have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the collapse and have instructed authorities to ensure the injured children receive proper medical treatment. All of the students involved were between eight and 11 years old.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's presence at the southern border has tripled to 7,600 troops, who are taking on a more central role in deterring migrant crossings under an emergency declaration by President Trump. Large swaths of the border have been designated as militarized zones, empowering troops to apprehend individuals on military-controlled land. A new command center in Arizona now oversees patrols using armored vehicles, helicopters, and drones to stop "got-aways" who evade authorities. This expansion sidesteps the Posse Comitatus Act, which normally prohibits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, representing a significant and controversial shift in U.S. border enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at imposing federal oversight on college sports, addressing athlete compensation and the preservation of non-revenue sports. The order directs federal agencies to enforce new provisions, including requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels for women's and Olympic sports. It also seeks to rein in name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, labeling pay-for-play arrangements as "improper." This move comes after a legal settlement opened the door for universities to pay players directly, raising fears that non-revenue sports could be cut as resources are diverted to football and basketball.</p>

The FCC's Republican head stated he welcomed Skydance's commitments to install an ombudsman to handle bias complaints and to end diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit alleges that the city's policies intentionally obstruct federal immigration law enforcement, thereby endangering public safety. The move comes less than a week after an off-duty Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant in Manhattan. City officials defended the policies, arguing they encourage all residents, regardless of immigration status, to report crimes without fear, while the mayor has previously stated the laws go too far in protecting violent criminals.</p>
