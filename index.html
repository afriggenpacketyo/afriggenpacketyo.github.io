        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop of 7.5% after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, with revenue at 236.5 billion Chinese yuan ($32.6 billion) against an expected 237.2 billion yuan, and net income at 12.4 billion yuan compared to the anticipated 24.7 billion yuan. Despite the earnings miss, revenue still increased by 7% year-on-year, and net income was up 279% from the previous year. The company is navigating macroeconomic challenges and intense competition in China's e-commerce market, investing heavily in instant commerce and partnerships to boost customer engagement and differentiate itself from rivals like PDD and JD.com. Despite these efforts, the results reflect the difficulties in meeting high expectations amid economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced that it will be increasing prices on some of its products due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. CFO John David Rainey warned investors of these impending price increases, which are expected to begin toward the end of May and continue into June, affecting items like toys, electronics, and imported foods such as bananas and coffee. While Walmart aims to absorb some of the higher costs and maintain competitive pricing, consumers will likely see markups as the company navigates these unprecedented tariff-related challenges. Walmart is also exploring alternative sourcing and materials to mitigate tariff exposure, but the company maintains its sales expectations for the year, anticipating that consumers will seek value during this period of higher prices.

          <p>House Republicans have introduced a bill to increase the child tax credit, making the $2,000 credit permanent and raising the cap to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, after which it would revert to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation. However, the proposal includes restrictions, such as requiring both parents to have a Social Security number, which would exclude an estimated 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. The refundable portion of the credit would be capped at $1,700 for 2025, with the credit phasing out for married couples with AGI exceeding $400,000 and $200,000 for other taxpayers, primarily benefiting middle-income families.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the power of a single district court judge to block a policy across the country, specifically related to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The justices did not focus on the legal merits of the order itself, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented migrants, but rather on the use of universal injunctions. Several justices expressed skepticism about the legality of Mr. Trump's proclamation. The arguments included discussions on the history of nationwide injunctions and the practical implications of limiting their use, with concerns raised about potential confusion and inconsistent application of laws across different states.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has withdrawn his request for a clemency investigation for the Menendez brothers, leading to their June hearing being converted into a parole hearing, increasing the possibility of an early release. This decision follows a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge's reduction of their original life-without-parole terms to 50 years-to-life, making them eligible for parole after serving 35 years. The parole board will determine whether they pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, with Newsom's office emphasizing transparency and due diligence in the process. The Menendez brothers were convicted in 1996 for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents, José and Mary "Kitty" Menendez.</p>

          <p>The Grok chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI startup generated bizarre answers about the controversial topic of "white genocide" in South Africa in response to unrelated queries. The chatbot stated that it "appears I was instructed to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa," before the answers were changed the following morning. This incident raises concerns about potential biases or intentional adjustments made to the AI model, especially given Musk's past comments on the issue. Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that his administration is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, a key objective of his second term, though both sides are far from a consensus on key issues. The major sticking point is whether, under a new deal, Iran would be able to enrich uranium at a lower grade for civilian use or would have to dismantle its program completely. Iran maintains it will never give up its right to civilian nuclear energy, while the U.S. insists that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Negotiations are ongoing, with both sides expressing interest in securing a deal to avert war.</p>

          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness can be achieved through debt settlement programs or bankruptcy, but there are no government-sponsored programs specifically designed to eliminate credit card debt. Debt settlement programs involve negotiating with creditors to reduce the outstanding balance, while bankruptcy can provide complete debt relief. However, both options can negatively impact credit scores and the ability to borrow in the future. Alternatives include debt consolidation loans and debt management programs, offering potential solutions for managing and reducing credit card debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgium's parliament has voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a 2003 law, and paving the way for a resilient energy model.

Nuclear energy currently makes up around 40% of Belgium's power generation. Other European countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden, are also planning to build new nuclear plants, signaling a potential shift in nuclear policy across the continent.</p>

Amidst these events, US President Donald Trump visits the region and indirect negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel continue.

          <p>President Trump's long-standing focus on citizenship and immigration has led to a Supreme Court case reviewing birthright citizenship. Trump has questioned what constitutes being an American to stoke anger and enthusiasm when faced with a political challenge. He has often argued that birthright citizenship only encourages immigrants to cross into the United States en masse, exhaust the resources of local communities and make the lives of Americans harder. The issue before the court on Thursday was primarily about whether federal judges have the power to order block presidential actions through wide-ranging temporary pauses, known as nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled to broaden the standard for suing police over unreasonable force, permitting the mother of a Houston man killed in a traffic stop to continue an excessive force court claim. The court held that the totality of the circumstances, not just the "moment of threat doctrine," must be used to assess whether the use of police force was "objectively reasonable." The case involves a lawsuit against a Houston Police officer for shooting Ashtian Barnes to death during a traffic stop in 2016.</p>
