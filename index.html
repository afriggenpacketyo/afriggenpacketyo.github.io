          <p>Rod Stewart discusses his upcoming performance in the "legends" slot at Glastonbury, expressing his wish that it wasn't called the "tea time slot." Stewart reminisces about his past Glastonbury performance in 2002, which he barely remembers, and recalls a massive free concert on Copacabana Beach where he was violently ill beforehand. He also touches on his early days with the Jeff Beck Group and the Faces, his struggles with womanizing, and his current happy marriage to Penny Lancaster, and how family is now his priority. He also dismisses the rumor that he used mayonnaise in his hair, claiming he used sugared hot water before hair lacquer.</p>

          <p>A lightning strike at a South Carolina lake injured twenty people, including eight adults and twelve minors, prompting a response from multiple emergency agencies. Twelve of the patients were transported to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, and all are expected to recover. The incident occurred at Dominion Beach Park at Dreher Dam, and the park is expected to reopen following safety assessments. This event follows a similar incident last week where a 15-year-old boy was struck by lightning in Manhattan but is also expected to recover.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into star formation. Analyzing data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that younger stars in the Milky Way spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, hindering the formation of massive stars. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxyâ€™s star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a few months. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the enrichment infrastructure remains largely intact. The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume their work, ranging from a few months to less than a year. The White House has disputed the assessment, calling it "flat-out wrong."</p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran's wife, Paola Clouatre, was detained by ICE during a green card meeting, leaving him to care for their two young children, including a breastfeeding infant. Paola, a Mexican national brought to the U.S. as a child, had a deportation order issued in 2018 due to her mother's failure to appear at a hearing, something she was unaware of. The Trump administration's strict enforcement policies have reduced discretion for military families seeking legal status, leading to increased deportations.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that "multiple system failures" led to the Alaska Airlines incident where a door plug flew off mid-flight in 2024, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes. The NTSB cited missing bolts and inadequate training as contributing factors. The NTSB has issued new safety recommendations to the FAA and Boeing, who have both responded by saying that they are taking the recommendations seriously. Passengers are suing Boeing and Alaska Airlines.</p>

Former CIA director David Petraeus cautioned against drawing conclusions at this stage, noting that battle damage assessments take time.
