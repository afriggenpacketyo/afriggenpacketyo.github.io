          <p>A wave of Gen Z-led anti-corruption protests has swept across Asia, from Nepal to Indonesia and the Philippines, fueled by widespread anger over social inequality and a perceived lack of opportunities. Young activists, effectively leveraging social media platforms like TikTok and AI tools, have mobilized thousands against perceived corruption, often targeting the "nepo kids" of establishment figures. These demonstrations have, at times, turned violent, resulting in deaths and property damage, and even led to the resignation of Nepal's prime minister. This article highlights the potent combination of youth activism and technology in challenging entrenched power structures, while also acknowledging the challenges in translating digital movements into fundamental social change.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle intensified into a Category 4 storm, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and is now on a trajectory towards the Azores. The Miami-based National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Azores, anticipating the powerful storm's approach Thursday night into Friday. Gabrielle is also expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina northward to Canada, for several days. This article provides crucial updates on the storm's path, strength, and potential widespread impact, urging coastal residents to remain vigilant.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball announced the implementation of an automated ball/strike (ABS) challenge system for the 2026 season, following extensive testing in the minor leagues. This hybrid approach will allow batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge up to two ball or strike calls per game, retaining the challenge if the call is overturned. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred emphasized that this system preserves the umpire's integral role while enabling corrections in high-leverage situations and maintaining game rhythm. Player preference for the challenge format over a fully automated system was a key factor, aiming to enhance accuracy and fan engagement without eliminating the human element entirely.</p>

          <p>YouTube announced a significant policy revision, allowing previously banned accounts, including those removed for Covid-19 or election-related misinformation, to apply for reinstatement. This change effectively rolls back prior lifetime bans for such offenses, aligning with updated Community Guidelines that now permit a wider range of content. The move follows increasing Republican pressure on tech companies to reverse Biden-era speech policies, with YouTube acknowledging "unacceptable and wrong" pressure from the Biden administration regarding specific content removal. This article highlights a notable shift in content moderation, aiming to balance free expression with platform integrity through a new, limited pilot program for reinstatement.</p>

          <p>Former ESPN and MSNBC contributor Keith Olbermann issued an apology for a controversial social media post directed at CNN commentator Scott Jennings, which Jennings subsequently referred to the FBI. Olbermann's original message, "You're next motherf---er," was posted nearly two weeks after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, drawing significant backlash. Olbermann claimed his post was "misinterpreted" as a threat to Jennings' career, not physical harm, and unequivocally condemned political violence. This article details the incident, Olbermann's swift retraction, and the broader context of heightened concerns over political violence following recent high-profile events.</p>

          <p>President Trump's substantial increase in H-1B visa fees has created a significant opportunity for Canada to attract skilled workers now deterred from the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney noted Canada's AI talent often migrates south, suggesting the visa changes could help retain them. The new $100,000 fee for H-1B applications has surprised tech companies and is expected to limit opportunities for highly educated foreigners. This article explores Canada's potential to become a natural destination for these workers, though experts caution about the country's own immigration system challenges and generally lower wages compared to the US.

The storm, which dumped inches of rain on the San Bernardino County mountains and foothills, unleashed a torrent of mud, rocks, and trees, particularly in burn scars. Three homes were completely destroyed, and over a dozen other homes and businesses suffered significant damage. Most tragically, a 2-year-old child died in Barstow after being swept away in a flash flood. This article details the severe human and property toll, with ongoing threats of more storms.</p>

Experts in maternal-fetal medicine emphasize that untreated fever in pregnancy poses known risks like miscarriage and birth defects, and acetaminophen remains one of the few safe options for pain and fever relief.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the recent interest rate cut was primarily prompted by a weakening labor market, despite ongoing concerns about stubborn inflation, creating a "challenging situation" for the central bank.

          <p>A federal jury convicted Ryan Routh on all five charges, including the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, following an incident at a Florida golf course last year. Routh, who represented himself, attempted to stab himself with a pen in the courtroom after the verdict, prompting intervention by U.S. Marshals. Prosecutors presented compelling evidence of his meticulous planning and intent, detailing surveillance, weapon purchases, and a "sniper's hide" near the golf course. The Deputy U.S. Attorney General emphasized that the verdict sends a clear message against political violence, reinforcing the importance of protecting democratic processes and public figures.
