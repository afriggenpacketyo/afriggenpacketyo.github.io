          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, which successfully restored sight in blind animals and granted them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how tellurium nanowire implants were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey, enabling them to perceive "invisible" light. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, potentially replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina and transmitting signals to the brain. This advancement offers significant promise for treating human blindness and potentially providing enhanced vision capabilities. The author's tone is one of cautious optimism.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Jennifer Garner discussed her experience with Botox and her thoughts on plastic surgery, advising caution when considering injectables. The actress revealed that Botox "doesn't work very well" for her, which is why she often wears bangs. Garner emphasized the importance of finding a skilled practitioner and proceeding carefully with cosmetic procedures. While she hasn't ruled out plastic surgery in the future, she noted that medical professionals have advised against it for her at this time, and stressed the importance of sunscreen and embracing aging.

          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to unrest sparked by ICE operations targeting undocumented migrants. The decision follows clashes between residents and federal agents in a predominantly Latino district, with tear gas and batons used to disperse crowds. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and an overreach, asserting that local law enforcement can handle the situation. The White House cited attacks on ICE officers and the need to halt the "invasion of illegal criminals" as justification for the action, while local officials and immigrant rights groups condemned the raids as sowing terror and undermining community trust.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Title 10, a rarely used power, has raised legal and constitutional concerns. Title 10 allows the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but constitutional scholars argue that using them to quell protests without the governor's request is a chilling overreach of federal power. Critics also fear Trump might invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows federal troops to suppress domestic unrest, to enforce immigration laws. The ACLU has warned against using the military domestically, citing historical prohibitions against troops providing direct assistance to civilian law enforcement. The author's tone is concerned and analytical.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing a demographic crisis. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong argue that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China's rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system necessitate innovative policy solutions to boost birth rates, which have fallen to an estimated 1.1 children per woman, well below the replacement level.

          <p>European startup founders and venture capitalists are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. While some argue that overwork is necessary to compete globally, many believe it leads to burnout, decreased retention, and conflicts with European values and regulations. Instead of increasing working hours, they emphasize the need for more funding, resources, and sustainable innovation cultures. They argue that Europe's most successful companies achieved dominance through sustainable practices, not overwork. The author's tone is assertive and supportive of work-life balance.</p>

          <p>De Kai, a machine learning scientist, proposes a new approach to artificial intelligence (AI) by suggesting that people should "parent" these systems as if they were their children. In his new book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," De Kai argues that because AI learns by absorbing everything we do and say online, we need to be conscientious about our behavior around these AI "children." This paradigm shift involves treating AI as beings that require guidance and ethical development, similar to raising a child. The author's tone is thoughtful and cautionary.</p>
