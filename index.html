          <p>Secretary of Education Linda McMahon sent a scathing letter to Harvard University President Alan Garber, criticizing the university's handling of antisemitism, plagiarism scandals, and the hiring of controversial figures. McMahon advised Harvard to refrain from applying for future federal grants, stating they would not be provided due to the university's systemic violations of federal law and mismanagement of funds. She also criticized Harvard's remedial math program and accused the university of inviting foreign students who engage in violent behavior. Harvard responded, accusing the administration of illegal overreach and stifling research, vowing to defend against these actions while combating antisemitism and promoting viewpoint diversity.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified New York Times article reveals that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.

The article highlights the administration's reaction to the initial reporting, including a criminal investigation into the leaks.

The City Parks Foundation scrapped the show after a top city official warned that its license to stage the SummerStage concert series could be at risk. This followed a similar cancellation at Cornell University, where officials cited Kehlani's alleged antisemitic views. Kehlani, who uses she/they pronouns, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in the Gaza conflict and maintains that she is not antisemitic.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Supporters of the bill call it a historic step in ensuring educational freedom, while Democrats argue that it will harm public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private schools.

          <p>The Trump administration informed Harvard University that it would end billions in research grants unless the school accedes to a list of demands, effectively ceding control to the government. Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused Harvard of a "systematic pattern of violating federal law" and mismanagement. The demands stem from the university's rejection of the administration's antisemitism taskforce and include concerns about academic diversity, far-left politics, and "ugly racism." Harvard is suing the federal government, arguing the demands impose unprecedented control and threaten crucial research.</p>
