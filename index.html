        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst growing concerns about national unity in Canada, Alberta's separatist movement is gaining momentum, fueled by discontent with Liberal rule and comparisons to the United States. Some Albertans express a stronger cultural affinity with neighboring American states and even advocate for joining the U.S., while others seek greater provincial autonomy within Canada. Premier Danielle Smith has publicly warned of a "national unity crisis" if Alberta's demands regarding oil and gas production are not met by the new prime minister, showcasing the deepening divide between Eastern and Western Canada. The situation presents a significant challenge to the country's political landscape and its next leader.</p>

          <p>Joseph Koenig was found guilty of first-degree murder for killing Alexa Bartell by throwing a rock through her windshield, along with other charges related to rock-throwing attacks on other vehicles. Two co-defendants, Nicholas Karol-Chik and Zachary Kwak, testified against Koenig as part of their plea agreements, claiming Koenig threw the fatal rock. The defense argued for a manslaughter conviction, stating Koenig didn't fully understand his actions, but the jury convicted him on all counts, although some were downgraded.

          <p>The Justice Department has revoked a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, potentially allowing authorities to subpoena reporters and compel testimony. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that intentional leaks of sensitive information undermine the DOJ's ability to uphold the law and protect national security. The decision marks a shift back to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations, similar to those used during the Trump and Obama administrations, raising concerns about press freedom and the protection of confidential sources.</p>
