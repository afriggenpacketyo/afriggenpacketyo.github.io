          <p>Since arriving at Aston Villa in 2022, Unai Emery has significantly reshaped the club, bringing in new backroom staff and receiving substantial backing in the transfer market, spending approximately Â£295m on 23 signings. Despite facing challenges with Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), Emery has successfully implemented his vision of a cultured, measured passing game, educating fans and prioritizing individual coaching with detailed opponent analysis. Defender Tyrone Mings praises Emery's in-game management, while midfielder John McGinn considers him one of the club's greatest managers, highlighting the transformative impact Emery has had on Aston Villa's playing style and overall success.</p>

          <p>Ray Seals, a former NFL player who remarkably made it to the professional level without playing college football, has died at the age of 59; the cause of death was not immediately released.

His journey began in semipro football with the Syracuse Express after high school, where his talent was recognized. Coach Ray Perkins gave him the opportunity to play in the NFL, marking an improbable rise to the highest level of professional football.</p>

          <p>The Senate adopted a Republican budget resolution after a marathon voting session, advancing President Trump's agenda and aiming to make tax cuts permanent while authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts. The resolution also includes raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion. Democrats offered amendments to force votes on issues like Medicaid and Social Security, but the Senate passed the resolution 51-48, setting it up for a House vote. The blueprint is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Republicans to pass the bill without Democratic support, though differences remain on spending cuts.</p>

          <p>Following the implementation of tariffs by Donald Trump on approximately 180 countries, the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a conservative organization, has initiated a lawsuit contesting the initial round of tariffs on Chinese imports.

Paxton denies the allegations and intends to appeal the ruling, calling it "ridiculous" and "not based on the facts or the law."

While ITV confirmed that both Broadway Boy and another faller, Celebre d'Allen, were being assessed, Animal Rising condemned the lack of replay and commentary on welfare standards. The race, won by Nick Rockett, saw several fallers despite recent safety improvements at Aintree. Concern was also raised for jockey Tom Bellamy, who was taken to the hospital for assessment.</p>

          <h2>Optimized Morning Routines and the Palatable Face of Toxic Masculinity</h2>

          <p>The article explores the trend of optimized morning routines promoted by fitness influencers, particularly focusing on Ashton Hall's viral routine. It questions whether these routines represent a benign pursuit of health or a more subtle form of toxic masculinity. The author argues that while Hall's content may seem harmless, it promotes regressive ideas about gender roles and reinforces a conservative worldview. The piece suggests that this type of content can be more insidious than overtly misogynistic material, as it normalizes unequal power dynamics.</p>

          <h2>Economists Question Trump's Tariff Formula, Claiming Inflated Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 14:41:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are challenging the formula behind President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff plan, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions. Senior fellows at the American Enterprise Institute argue that the formula uses an elasticity rate lower than it should be, leading to inflated tariff rates. A report from the Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than they are in practice. These findings suggest that the actual impact of the tariffs may be less severe than the administration claims.</p>

          <p>A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky was swept away by floodwaters and died while walking to his school bus stop, despite a flash flood warning in effect. The Franklin County School District had canceled two bus routes earlier that morning due to flooding but did not cancel classes. The mother of a classmate questioned why the district didn't postpone or cancel school given the dangerous conditions. The boy's death is under investigation, and Kentucky's governor offered condolences to the family.</p>

          <p>Luis Enrique has successfully transformed Paris St-Germain by instilling a philosophy focused on team structure, repetition, and positional discipline. Despite initial reservations about coaching a team of individual stars, Enrique has prioritized building a cohesive unit, leading to the departure of players like Neymar and Verratti. He emphasizes the importance of defensive duties for all players, including star forward Kylian Mbappe. Enrique's relentless approach has helped PSG overcome a rocky start, ultimately leading to success.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled more than a dozen international student visas at California universities, including UCLA, UC San Diego, and Stanford, with little explanation. UC San Diego reported that five students had their visas revoked, and a sixth was deported. The University of California implied that students at other campuses have also been affected, but details are limited. The actions are part of mass visa cancellations across the country, and it is unclear if the revocations are related to pro-Palestinian protests or other violations.</p>

          <p>As U.S. consumers rush to buy goods before President Trump's tariffs take full effect, experts caution against going into debt to beat the price increases. While stocking up on some items may seem logical, economists warn that the tariffs are expected to increase prices for everyday items and could lead to a recession. Experts advise consumers to prioritize their long-term financial situations and avoid panic buying, as the supply chain is in better shape than during the COVID-19 pandemic. *(not investment advice)* <br><i></p>

          <p>The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, dismissed a deputy, Shahram Dabiri, for taking a "lavish" trip to Antarctica with his wife during Nowruz, the Persian New Year. The trip was deemed "unjustifiable and unacceptable" given Iran's economic challenges, with high unemployment and inflation. The incident sparked outrage after a picture of Dabiri and his wife in front of the MV Plancius, bound for Antarctica, circulated on social media. Pezeshkian emphasized that such actions contradict the principle of simplicity for those in authority.</p>
