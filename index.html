          <p>The Bank of Korea has kept its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, due to stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook. Policymakers remain vigilant about household debt and the housing market, especially after new, tighter property regulations were implemented across Seoul and surrounding areas. Despite the central bank's pause, some analysts anticipate a rate cut in November to bolster economic growth, particularly if trade talks progress and housing policies stabilize. The Korean won weakened, reaching its lowest level since May, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>New York City's mayoral contenders, Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa, engaged in a contentious final televised debate, less than two weeks before the election. The candidates sparred over various issues including ICE raids, homelessness, housing policies like rent freezes, and zoning reforms. Mamdani faced accusations regarding his stance on Jewish New Yorkers, which he vehemently denied, while Cuomo's past sexual assault allegations were brought up. The debate highlighted deep divisions and personal attacks, with candidates struggling to present unified visions for the city's future amidst a backdrop of escalating rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted two recent strikes against alleged drug vessels in the East Pacific, resulting in five deaths, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. These operations extend the Trump administration's nine-strike campaign against suspected narcotics trafficking boats, which has now caused at least 37 fatalities since last month. Critics, including Senator Mark Kelly, question the legal and constitutional basis for these strikes, noting that the targeted routes primarily transport cocaine to Europe, not fentanyl to the U.S. Survivors from previous strikes have faced repatriation and legal challenges, highlighting the complex implications of these aggressive interdiction efforts.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the company of systematically discriminating against thousands of pregnant employees and workers with disabilities in its state warehouses. The complaint alleges Amazon unlawfully placed these employees on unpaid leave, denied reasonable accommodations, and retaliated against them, sometimes leading to termination for failing to meet productivity quotas. Amazon denies the accusations, stating it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and assesses performance based on safe expectations. This lawsuit follows a years-long investigation and previous scrutiny over Amazon's treatment of pregnant workers.</p>

          <p>The identity of a person of interest, previously protected by law, in the 1970 disappearance of British girl Cheryl Grimmer in Australia has been revealed in the New South Wales parliament. Jeremy Buckingham used parliamentary privilege to name the man, known as Mercury, and read out his 1971 teenage confession, which was later ruled inadmissible. Cheryl's family, who were present, have been advocating for a fresh inquiry since the case was dropped six years ago. Despite a recent review finding no new evidence, the family hopes this public naming will prompt new information to emerge, seeking justice for Cheryl.</p>

          <p>Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suggested his height is a factor in receiver Jaylen Waddle's limited targets during their recent 31-6 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Tagovailoa, listed at 6-foot-1, stated it can be difficult to see smaller receivers over the offensive line, leading him to progress through reads rather than force throws. Waddle, the team's top receiver without Tyreek Hill, caught only one pass for 15 yards on four targets. This admission comes as the Dolphins struggle with a 1-6 record, and Tagovailoa leads the NFL in interceptions this season, raising questions about the team's offensive performance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has begun the demolition of the White House East Wing to construct a 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project he claims is privately funded and will cost $300 million. This decision has sparked strong criticism from historians and preservationists who argue the massive addition will overwhelm the historic residence. The White House defends the project as a "visionary addition" echoing past presidential improvements.

A clinical trial, co-led by Dr. Angela DeMichele, successfully identified and attacked these lurking cells in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who had an aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer. After six months of treatment, her dormant cells were undetectable.

Despite screening availability, a lack of public health education means many cancers, including lung, prostate, colon, and breast cancers, are detected late.

          <h2>Menopause Screening to Be Integrated into NHS Health Checks in England</h2>

          <p>Starting next year, menopause screening will be officially included in NHS health checks for women aged 40 to 74 in England. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice, support, and treatments such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized that the measure seeks to bring menopause into mainstream health discussions, reducing stigma and improving support. While campaigners welcome the move, concerns remain about the low uptake of health checks in some communities, particularly among ethnic minorities and in poorer areas, potentially limiting the reach of this important new service.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's pledge to cut UK energy bills by £300 faces scrutiny, with the expert behind the original estimate now casting doubt on its achievability. Economist Pawel Czyzak of Ember, whose 2023 report formed the basis of the promise, states the analysis needs updating due to changes in offshore wind costs and other factors. He warns that rising electricity grid upgrade costs could "wipe out" projected savings. While the government insists its clean power plan will lower bills, a think tank also suggests shifting focus from "clean power" to "cheaper power" and axing carbon taxes to reduce costs.</p>

          <p>Last-minute changes to new port fees enacted by the Trump administration's U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) have hit Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a U.S.-based ocean carrier, with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill. The company was reclassified under new Section 301 program terms, with fees now based on vessel net tonnage capacity rather than cargo type. ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, expressed shock, stating the company, which primarily carries containers, is unfairly penalized as a "Ro/Ro container" vessel. He warns these tariffs could force ACL to relocate operations, impacting U.S. importers and exporters who rely on their unique hybrid service. (not investment advice)</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the measures are crucial to "degrade the Kremlin's ability to raise revenue for its war machine," especially after an intense Russian bombardment killed seven in Ukraine.
