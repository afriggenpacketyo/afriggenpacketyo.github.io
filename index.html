            <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price inflation rate decreased to 2.4% in March, exceeding economists' forecasts, as President Trump prepared to enact tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The consumer price index, a comprehensive measure of goods and services costs, experienced a 0.1% decline in March, resulting in a 2.4% inflation rate over the past 12 months. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, grew at an annual rate of 2.8%, reflecting a monthly increase of 0.1% and marking the lowest core inflation rate since March 2021. This development is significant as it suggests a potential cooling of the economy amid trade policy changes.</p>

            <p>Two former research chimpanzees, Al and Kamaka, both in their 50s, have been relocated to Chimp Haven, a federal sanctuary in Louisiana, where they are experiencing life among females for the first time. The move involved transporting 21 chimps from the Alamogordo Primate Facility, which closed after the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reversed its initial decision due to caregiver retirements. The NIH stopped invasive biomedical research on chimps a decade ago, and most of the chimps have been transferred to Chimp Haven since then. The sanctuary aims to provide a happy ending for chimps who have spent decades in research.</p>

            <p>In response to escalating trade tensions with the United States, China is strengthening its export-control measures to protect its interests. The Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) announced plans to enhance the export control system and improve enforcement, particularly as the global environment becomes more challenging. These efforts include tightening licensing enforcement, expanding dialogue on export controls, and promoting compliance frameworks. This move comes as the U.S. has imposed a 125% tariff on Chinese imports, while China has increased tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% and imposed export controls on several U.S. entities.</p>

            <p>The Nasdaq Composite experienced its second-best day ever, climbing over 12% as markets recovered from recent turbulence caused by President Trump's tariffs. Apple's stock surged by more than 15%, marking its best day since January 1998, after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for some countries. This rally followed a period of market instability triggered by aggressive tariff plans, with Apple regaining its position as the most valuable company after a significant drop in market value. The tech-heavy index recorded its most substantial session since January 2001, reflecting a broad market recovery.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the U.S. for using tariffs as a weapon for selfish gains. Lin stated that this action is against the interests of the entire world and that Beijing's response would safeguard its economy and the international community's common interests. He emphasized that trade wars have no winners and that China, while not desiring conflict, will not fear it. Lin accused the U.S. of prioritizing its own interests over the global community, which he believes will face increased opposition.</p>

            <p>Amid President Trump's trade policy of imposing tariffs on goods imported from China, there are concerns about potential price increases for iPhones in the U.S. While Apple has been diversifying its supply chains, with some iPhones manufactured in India, a significant portion of devices intended for the U.S. market are still made in China. Analysts estimate that iPhone prices could substantially rise if the costs incurred by tariffs are passed onto consumers. Apple has not yet announced its plans to address the tariffs, but analysts suggest the company's strong branding and profit margins could allow it to absorb some costs or pass them on to consumers.</p>

Delap's previous club, Manchester City, holds a 'buy-back' fee at Â£40m. The Â£30m release clause is considered good value given his age and the 'Premier League premium for English forwards'.</p>

            <p>Ahead of U.S.-Iran talks, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report stating that Iran's nuclear weapons program has reached an extremely dangerous stage. The report cites Iran's increased nuclear weapon capabilities, shorter time frames to build nuclear weapons, and internal discussions favoring nuclear weapon construction as major negative factors. President Trump has stated that the U.S. will not allow Iran to possess a nuclear weapon, suggesting military action is possible if a deal is not reached. The report also warns of Iran's military capabilities, including drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles.</p>

            <p>President Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have pledged to increase the Pentagon's budget to a record US$1 trillion, a significant rise from the US$892 billion allocated for national defense this year. This commitment to a higher defense budget, amidst federal spending cuts, reflects a strategic focus on boosting military deterrence against China. The move comes as escalating tariffs intensify the U.S.-China trade war, heightening fears of further decoupling between the two economies and potential geopolitical risks. Observers believe that Washingtonâs commitment to a significantly higher defence budget, alongside other policy shifts under President Donald Trump, reflected long-term strategic planning aimed at boosting military deterrence against China.</p>

            <p>Crude oil futures experienced a decline of over 2% on Thursday due to President Trump's steep tariffs on China overshadowing his temporary pause on higher rates for most other countries. U.S. crude oil fell to $60.59 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent decreased to $63.76 per barrel. The decision to increase tariffs on China, the world's second-largest economy and biggest crude importer, weighed on the market. Analysts suggest that the ongoing negotiations and policy uncertainties will continue to contribute to market volatility.</p>

Trump had also brought high tariffs on dozens of other countries but these have been suspended for 90 days. He argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but many economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs. The UK government has so far not announced any taxes on US imports, but economists have warned US tariffs could knock the UK's economy off course and make it harder for the government to hit its borrowing rules.</p>
