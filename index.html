          <p>According to analysts, the United States is finding it difficult to get public commitments from Japan and Australia regarding their potential actions in a conflict over Taiwan. This push is perceived by some as a tactic to amplify a "China threat" narrative. The primary goal may be to encourage these key allies to increase their defense spending and strengthen military cooperation with the U.S., including purchasing American weaponry, rather than securing a firm pledge on Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it will soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, following assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. This move reverses previous restrictions and is seen as a significant win for the company, which had seen its market share in China decline. The decision follows lobbying efforts by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued the curbs inhibited American tech leadership and met with President Trump to discuss the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes from Mexico, ending a long-standing trade agreement and sparking a contentious debate. Supporters, like the Florida Tomato Exchange, argue the move protects U.S. farmers from unfairly low prices that have decimated the domestic industry. However, critics and some business groups warn that the tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices for produce and harm U.S. companies that rely on Mexican imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 Afghans, granting a one-week stay. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing Afghanistan's security situation has improved, but opponents contend the country remains unsafe. Advocacy groups hailed the ruling as a brief but critical relief, underscoring the need for a permanent solution for families who fled the Taliban's takeover.</p>

          <p>A jury has convicted former Major League Baseball pitcher Daniel Serafini of the first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Robert Spohr, in a 2021 home invasion.

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has made history as the oldest person to ever complete the Badwater 135 ultramarathon. The race is nicknamed "the world's toughest" for its grueling 135-mile course through California's Death Valley in extreme summer heat. Becker's successful finish was a personal redemption, as he had narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time during his attempt in 2022, and he completed this year's race with hours to spare.</p>

          <p>At least four firefighters have been injured while battling three major wildfires across Northern California, where crews are facing extreme heat and treacherous terrain. The injuries include blunt force trauma and heat-related illnesses. Nearly 700 firefighters are working in triple-digit temperatures to contain the blazes, which have collectively burned almost 20,000 acres of bone-dry forest. The largest, the Green fire, remains largely uncontained due to its remote and inaccessible location.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record volume of shipping containers in June, its busiest in 117 years. Port executives attribute the surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," with importers racing to bring in goods from China before a mid-August deadline for new U.S. tariffs. This spike is seen not as a sign of broad economic health but as a temporary distortion caused by trade policy uncertainty, with volumes expected to drop once the tariffs are implemented.

During a Fox Business interview about a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid, he suggested people should "do the most" to stay healthy, offering the example, "don't eat carrot cake." His comments were widely seen as out-of-touch as millions of Americans are set to be removed from the federal health care program.</p>
