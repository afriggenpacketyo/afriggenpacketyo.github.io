          <h2>Rubber Duck Museum Relocates to Canada Due to Tariff Instability</h2>

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is moving to Canada due to the instability caused by President Trump's tariffs on goods from China and strained relations with Canada. Owners Neil and Krystal King cited a significant drop in Canadian visitors, who feel offended by the rhetoric coming from the White House, as well as 145% tariffs on their Chinese-made rubber ducks. Despite the potential for tariffs to be dropped, the Kings are moving to ensure a sustainable business model, as the uncertainty of daily tariff changes makes planning difficult. The museum's relocation highlights the tangible impact of international trade policies on small businesses reliant on cross-border tourism and trade.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul, hours after European leaders urged Moscow to agree to a 30-day ceasefire. Putin stated Russia seeks "serious negotiations" for a lasting peace but did not directly respond to the ceasefire proposal. European leaders, including representatives from the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, threatening new sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if the ceasefire isn't agreed upon. The Kremlin responded cautiously, warning against attempts to pressure Russia and stating the need to consider the proposal.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for six weeks, following a judge's order for her release on bail. Ozturk thanked her community and supporters, expressing faith in the American justice system, and mentioned the support she received during her detention. A federal judge in Vermont cited a lack of evidence for her detainment beyond an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas, arguing that her First Amendment rights were violated. Ozturk's lawyers emphasized her worsening asthma while in detention and the court will weigh the standing of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared a "total reset" in US-China trade relations following discussions in Geneva aimed at de-escalating a trade war. Top US and Chinese officials met for eight hours to address tensions resulting from tariff increases. While neither side released specific details, Trump praised the "very good" discussions and progress towards opening China to American business. The talks occurred amidst concerns about the global economic impact of the trade dispute, which has disrupted supply chains and unsettled financial markets, though analysts remain cautiously optimistic about achieving a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Four people, including three teenage boys, were shot on a SEPTA bus in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park neighborhood on Saturday evening. The victims, two 16-year-olds, a 14-year-old, and a 39-year-old woman, are in stable condition, with injuries including shots to the back, hand, and foot. Police believe a man in his 40s confronted a group of juveniles, pulled a gun, and shot the four individuals, though the motive remains unclear. The incident, which occurred with around 30 people on board, is under investigation, with police reviewing onboard camera footage to identify the shooter.</p>

Her testimony, along with that of another ex-girlfriend and physical evidence, led to Doyle's conviction for second-degree murder.

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that a new oral medication, zongertinib, shows promise as a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option when treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The medication targets the HER2 protein, blocking the activity of tyrosine kinase, which signals cell growth. The trial was conducted at 82 sites worldwide, including institutions in the US, China, and Japan.</p>

The walkway will include soil-covered surfaces planted with trees and flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, and event spaces, with cafes and food trucks planned.

The loss also highlighted a troubling trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records, losing eight of their last eleven games against such opponents.

Prosecutors argued that Ryan, who was significantly older than Harris, provided her with dangerous drugs, leading to her addiction and eventual death. The case hinged on text messages revealing Ryan's provision of drugs and photos documenting the presence of medical paraphernalia in their home. The defense argued that Harris struggled with mental illness and may have taken the drugs herself, but the jury ultimately sided with the prosecution, resulting in a 45-year prison sentence for Ryan.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming viable suppliers, facilitated by overseas investment and cooperative farming initiatives. Yunnan, a southwestern Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a crucial role in regional agricultural cooperation. Its involvement dates back to the “alternative crop cultivation programme,” which aimed to reduce opium production by sharing agricultural technology. Overseas agricultural investment and cooperation can effectively support China's food security by diversifying its food supply sources, given China's demand and limited farmland.</p>

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler based in Bedford, UK, hosts "cuddle puddles" and offers one-to-one cuddle therapy, promoting the health benefits of platonic touch. Wood believes touch boosts serotonin and oxytocin levels, while reducing cortisol, benefitting individuals with nervous system issues, PTSD, or loneliness. While some may view the service with skepticism, Wood emphasizes the platonic and nurturing nature, screening clients and obtaining consent to establish boundaries. Experts suggest that the relationship between individuals involved in touch is important, with familiar touch offering greater benefits, emphasizing the need for safety and trust.</p>

Luckin is strategically expanding into smaller cities. The expansion into these markets indicates a shift towards reaching a broader consumer base, although it remains important to monitor the sustainability of this growth beyond wealthier urban centers.</p>

          <p>Despite the introduction of app-based digital salary payments in Japan two years ago, adoption remains slow, with only a small percentage of workers opting for this method. While over 100 companies offer PayPay as a payment option, only 2.8% of surveyed individuals use such apps for their salaries. Experts suggest that greater perceived benefits are needed to increase popularity, particularly among part-time workers seeking quicker payments. Concerns about the lack of need and increased administrative work have also led many companies to avoid introducing the option, despite the increasing trend toward cashless payments in Japan.</p>

The proposal comes after Ukraine and its Western allies requested a 30-day ceasefire without preconditions, which Putin did not directly address.

This economic downturn is exacerbated by the pandemic closures, with many Canadians choosing to "Buy Canadian" and limit travel to the US.

Simple and effective staging is key, avoiding over-the-top performances that overshadow the music. Songs should be catchy with a surprise twist, such as a key change or costume reveal, and embrace the quirky and LGBT-friendly elements that Eurovision fans appreciate. While the perfect formula remains elusive, these elements can increase a song's chances of standing out and capturing the hearts of the audience.</p>

The airport admitted to exceeding environmental permit limits in 2022 but denies any link to the bacterial pollution.
