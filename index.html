            <h2>Bank of England Urged to Cut Interest Rates Amid Tariff-Induced Economic Uncertainty</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean advocates for an immediate interest rate cut to 4% in response to financial instability caused by President Trump's tariffs, which have significantly impacted global stock markets. Bean believes this aggressive monetary policy is crucial to counteract delayed business investments and reduced consumer spending resulting from tariff-related uncertainty. Another former Bank rate setter, David Blanchflower, suggests an emergency meeting to consider a deeper rate reduction to boost confidence and prevent a potential economic downturn. Financial markets have already priced in some rate cuts, but Bean argues for a more substantial response to the disinflationary shock. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's new tariff regime, styled as America’s “Liberation Day,” may inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Trump's decision to impose steep duties on imports from numerous countries has triggered fears of a global recession and prompted nations to seek countermeasures against American threats. This could potentially aid China's long-standing application to join the CPTPP, a trading bloc comprising 12 member countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have reached an agreement allowing ICE to access taxpayer information to locate illegal immigrants subject to deportation. This memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishes a process for ICE to request information from the IRS to further investigate criminal illegal immigrants who have failed to leave the United States 90 days after a final removal order. While the Treasury Department emphasizes protecting the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers, a criminal exception mandates assistance to law enforcement. Some IRS officials have expressed concerns that this policy may hinder tax collection from illegal immigrants.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as economists raised concerns about a potential U.S. recession and President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs against China. Leading indexes initially fell sharply, then briefly rebounded before declining again. Economists at Goldman Sachs increased the odds of a recession to 45% due to the combination of larger tariffs, policy uncertainty, and declining confidence. Stocks wavered further as Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports if China retaliates with its own tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened China with an additional 50% tariff on goods if it does not withdraw its 34% counter-tariff, causing further turmoil in global markets. Beijing has accused Washington of "economic bullying" and vowed to safeguard its interests. This threat comes on top of existing tariffs, potentially leading to a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports. Uncertainty around the tariffs has led to turbulent trading, with markets worldwide plunging since Trump announced the global tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will begin direct engagement with Iran, beginning Saturday. During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said that "we're having direct talks with Iran," beginning Saturday. He said Iran is "going to be in great danger" if the direct talks don't go well. The meeting took place as new tariffs the president is levying on Israel and the rest of the world are about to go into effect on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>As US President Donald Trump instigates a global trade war with sweeping tariffs, engagement between Europe and China has increased. A softening tone towards China from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and increased engagement between European and Chinese officials suggests a shifting mindset. Economists largely agree that tariffs act as a sales tax on consumers and can spark further inflation, yet the Trump administration has decided to launch tariffs the likes of which the world has not seen for a very long time.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts noted the team's struggles with fundamentals and the need to play cleaner baseball.

            <p>The Supreme Court handed down a 5-4 decision tossing out a closely watched district court decision, which blocked President Donald Trump’s attempt to use a 227-year-old law — the Alien Enemies Act — to deport many individuals without due process. The Court largely voted along party lines, although Republican Justice Amy Coney Barrett crossed over to dissent with the three Democratic justices. The Court does not express an opinion on whether the Alien Enemies Act actually permits Trump to deport anyone, but rules that, before anyone is deported under this law, that person must be given “notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”</p>

            <p>White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said in an interview that Vietnam’s offer for 0% tariffs on U.S. imports “means nothing,” shifting the emphasis to non-tariff trade barriers and other issues. Vietnam scrambled to offer no tax on U.S. imports after President Donald Trump hit the country with 46% tariffs, but that move wasn't enough for Trump trade counselor Peter Navarro, who accused it of “cheating” and increased the expectations for countries targeted by new tariffs. Navarro said that the alleged “non-tariff cheating” he referred to included letting China route its exports through a country to avoid tariffs, stealing intellectual property, and levying a value-added tax (VAT) on products.</p>
