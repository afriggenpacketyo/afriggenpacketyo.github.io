        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly passed Republican tax and spending bill provides significant benefits to the wealthiest U.S. households, with the exact amount varying by state, according to a new analysis. The top 1% of earners in states like Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, which lack a state income tax, could see average tax cuts exceeding $100,000 annually. The legislation's structure, which extends 2017 tax cuts and caps state and local tax deductions, disproportionately favors high-income individuals in low-tax states. In contrast, the wealthiest residents in high-tax states like California and New Jersey will receive comparatively smaller benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive legislative package, championed by President Trump, has cleared Congress and is headed to the president's desk. The bill permanently extends most of the 2017 tax cuts, increases spending for border security and defense, and rolls back green energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. To partially offset these costs, the legislation imposes new restrictions on Medicaid, including work requirements, and cuts funding for food stamp programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years, a figure disputed by the White House. (not investment advice)</p>

She emphasizes the importance of clear and honest communication with her players, a directness she attributes partly to her Dutch background.

          <p>With average credit card interest rates surpassing 21%, many Americans find their debt growing beyond what personal budgeting can handle. Key indicators that a do-it-yourself payoff plan is failing include being unable to pay more than the minimum, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit for essential living expenses. Another warning sign is a debt-to-income ratio exceeding 40%, which signals that debt is consuming an unsustainable portion of income. When these signs appear, it may be time to consider professional debt relief options like credit counseling or debt settlement programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has acknowledged that MI5's provision of false evidence to multiple courts constitutes a "serious failing" and has agreed to a new independent investigation. The decision follows a High Court ruling that dismissed previous internal and government-commissioned inquiries as unreliable. The case originated from MI5's attempts to block a BBC story about a neo-Nazi state agent who had abused his partner. The new investigation will be overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, whose own office was also misled by the security service during the case.</p>

The visit is prompted by concerns over safety, flooding, and potential human rights violations at the state-run facility, which was recently toured by President Trump and Governor DeSantis. The lawmakers have criticized the project as "inhumane political theater" and a corrupt scheme to enrich GOP donors under the guise of border enforcement. The facility, designed to hold 5,000 ICE detainees, is also facing a legal challenge from environmental groups over its ecological impact.</p>

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, engine bearings in these vehicles may fail, potentially causing the engine to lose power while driving.

          <p>Despite internal opposition and public unpopularity, Republican lawmakers have largely united to pass President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," demonstrating his firm control over the party. The legislation, which extends tax cuts and boosts immigration enforcement while cutting social safety nets, saw GOP members abandon prior commitments regarding the national debt and Medicaid. Senator Thom Tillis was a notable exception, voting against the bill and announcing his retirement, while others like Senators Josh Hawley and Ron Johnson ultimately fell in line after initial resistance. This political maneuvering highlights a party prioritizing a legislative win for the president over individual policy stances or voter sentiment.</p>

          <p>With the passage of the Republican "big, beautiful bill," major changes to the U.S. health care system are imminent, particularly concerning Medicaid. The legislation introduces a work requirement and restricts state financing mechanisms, which the Congressional Budget Office projects will cause nearly 12 million people to lose insurance and slash Medicaid spending by over $1 trillion. This article argues that Republicans now "own" the American health care system and its ensuing problems, including increased costs for everyone as hospitals pass on uncompensated care expenses. The political fallout could be significant, setting the stage for future battles over health care policy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence & Analysis is planning to cut its workforce by nearly 75%, reducing staff from approximately 1,000 to 275 employees. The move has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers and law enforcement agencies, who warn that it could create dangerous security gaps in a heightened threat environment. This office is the sole intelligence community member tasked with sharing threat information with state and local partners. A DHS spokesperson defended the cuts, stating the department is eliminating redundant positions to refocus on its core mission of American safety and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Williams Formula 1 driver Alex Albon believes his strong performance this season is being highlighted by having the highly-rated Carlos Sainz as his teammate and benchmark. While Albon has decisively outperformed Sainz in both points and qualifying, he attributes this to his car's suitability to his driving style, a factor he feels is often overlooked in F1. Albon also discusses his team's long-term ambitions, stating that while he doesn't expect to fight for wins next year, he realistically anticipates Williams will be competitive at the front of the grid by the 2028 season.</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000, the initial monthly payments for a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) are currently almost identical due to similar average interest rates. However, the long-term cost can differ significantly because home equity loans have fixed rates, providing predictable payments, while HELOCs have variable rates that fluctuate with market conditions. A drop in market rates could make a HELOC cheaper over time, whereas a rise would increase payments. Homeowners must weigh the stability of a fixed-rate loan against the potential savings or risks of a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

Jeffries used the platform to condemn the legislation's significant cuts to programs like Medicaid and its tax breaks, which he argued would harm vulnerable Americans. This historic filibuster-style speech surpassed the previous record set by former Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in 2021.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates at historic highs, several common habits can significantly increase the cost of carrying debt. Making only minimum payments is a primary mistake, as it barely reduces the principal balance and can extend repayment over decades. Other costly errors include ignoring the expiration dates of promotional 0% APR offers, using high-fee cash advances that accrue interest immediately, and closing old credit cards, which can harm your credit score by increasing your utilization ratio. Even a single late payment can trigger penalty APRs, dramatically escalating the cost of existing balances. (not investment advice)</p>
