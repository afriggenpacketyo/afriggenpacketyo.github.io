          <p>A non-profit in Connecticut is helping to restore the Long Island Sound's ecosystem by recycling used oyster shells from local restaurants. The shells provide a crucial surface for new oysters to grow, which in turn filter water, prevent erosion, and create habitats for hundreds of other species. This effort, funded by state grants, is part of a broader movement along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts to replenish overfished oyster beds and improve ocean health.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including the U.K. and Canada, has issued a joint statement demanding an end to the war in Gaza and condemning Israel for what they term the "inhumane killing of civilians" and "drip feeding of aid." The statement highlights the severe humanitarian crisis as Israel expands its ground operations into Deir al-Balah, a central Gaza city. Israel rejected the statement, maintaining its actions comply with international law and blaming Hamas for the conflict's toll.</p>

The policy specifically targets individuals connected to the Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which the Trump administration designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This move comes as Haiti continues to grapple with extreme gang violence and political instability, with a prominent Haitian businessman reportedly arrested in Miami in connection with these efforts.</p>

Johnson stated the administration needs "space to do what it is doing" after it formally asked a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts.

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and prompting discussions about an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration, driven by factors like the planet's liquid core, could eventually require the removal of a second—a "negative leap second"—from our global time standard. Interestingly, climate change's effect of melting polar ice has slightly counteracted this trend by slowing the rotation, potentially delaying the need for this complex and untested adjustment.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency is animated not by policy or ideology, but by a culture of small-minded pettiness and vengeance. The piece cites recent examples, such as retaliating against former intelligence officials and pushing for Ukraine aid only after feeling personally slighted by Vladimir Putin, as evidence of a governing style based on emotion and personal grievances. This approach, the article contends, has been internalized by his administration and replaces substantive problem-solving with a focus on loyalty checks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will begin using military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, following approval from the Pentagon. The plan also includes increasing detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to handle the overflow from mass arrests. This move is part of the Trump administration's strategy to expand its detention capabilities as it ramps up immigration enforcement, drawing condemnation from Democratic lawmakers who called it an inappropriate use of military resources.</p>
