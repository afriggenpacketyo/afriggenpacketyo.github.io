          <p>London-listed Anglo American and Canada's Teck Resources have agreed to a "merger of equals," creating one of the world's top five copper producers. The new entity, named Anglo Teck, will be headquartered in Canada and is expected to strengthen Canadian leadership in critical minerals. Following the announcement, Anglo American's shares surged by 9.6%, reflecting investor optimism about the deal that will see its shareholders own 62.4% of the combined company. The merger highlights a significant consolidation in the global mining sector, driven by the increasing demand for materials essential for the green energy transition. (not investment advice)</p>

Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season despite leading them to a Europa League victory, arrived at Forest's training grounds on Tuesday. Nuno's departure after 21 months came as a surprise to many players, especially after he guided the club to its highest Premier League finish since 1995 last season. The move marks the eighth permanent manager appointment under owner Evangelos Marinakis since 2017, signaling ongoing changes at the club.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis argues that Donald Trump has consistently used the presidency for personal financial enrichment, a practice that has become more overt in his second term. Despite publicizing the donation of his presidential salary, Trump and his family have reportedly generated billions from ventures like meme coins and a publicly traded media company. These enterprises leverage his political status to attract investors, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and corruption. For instance, Trump hosted a dinner for top investors in his "$TRUMP" coin, offering them direct access to the president, blurring the lines between public office and private business.

          <p>In a hearing before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, BBC Director General Tim Davie addressed a series of recent high-profile scandals, stating that "no-one is irreplaceable." Both Davie and BBC Chair Samir Shah affirmed their commitment to reforming the corporation's culture and holding individuals accountable for abuses of power, regardless of their fame. The discussion covered recent issues, including the dismissal of "MasterChef" presenters and controversial Glastonbury festival coverage. Davie acknowledged that changing the culture is an ongoing process and that more issues may yet surface as the organization works to improve its standards.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike has killed more than 20 people in the village of Yarova in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The victims were reportedly civilians who were collecting their pensions at the time of the attack. This incident represents one of the deadliest assaults on Ukrainian civilians in recent weeks, occurring as Russian forces continue their advance in the east. President Zelensky shared graphic footage of the aftermath and called on the international community, including the US, Europe, and the G20, to respond to what he described as a ruthless attack.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch family has been resolved, ensuring Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan will control the conservative-leaning media empire, which includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the agreement, Lachlan will manage a new trust, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts holding shares in Fox or News Corp. Instead, they are set to sell their holdings and will receive approximately $1.1 billion each in cash.

          <p>Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are experiencing a significant increase in applications, a trend attributed by educators like former Spelman College president Beverly Daniel Tatum to the current political climate. Tatum suggests that as anti-Black rhetoric becomes more prevalent and there are efforts to erase Black history, students are seeking refuge and affirmation at HBCUs. While this surge reflects a positive interest in these institutions, it also presents challenges, as many applicants require financial aid that HBCUs, despite lower tuition, struggle to provide sufficiently. The trend highlights a desire among Black students for educational environments where their history and identity are centered and valued.</p>

          <p>A Fort Myers, Florida country radio station, WHEL 93.7 FM, has rebranded itself as "Trump Country," using President Trump's name, image, and a similar campaign logo to attract listeners.

The station's general manager, who is also a Republican congressional candidate, stated they did not seek permission for the branding, viewing it as "comedy."

          <p>Columnist Michael Hiltzik argues that rhetoric from figures like President Trump, such as describing certain individuals as "born to be criminals," echoes the dangerous ideology of eugenics. This pseudoscientific movement, popular in the early 20th century, sought to improve society by controlling heredity and was used to justify forced sterilization and later, Nazi atrocities. The article suggests that modern political language targeting specific groups, such as transgender people or the "undeserving poor," reflects a eugenicist mindset of dividing society into "fit" and "unfit" populations.

          <p>Historian Jean Pfaelzer sees echoes of the violent purges of Chinese immigrants in 19th-century California in the Trump administration's current immigration policies. The article highlights the story of Oo Dock, one of the few Chinese individuals allowed to remain in Del Norte County after white mobs forcibly expelled hundreds in 1885. Pfaelzer argues that just as the Chinese were driven out and forced into hiding, today's roundups create a climate of fear that prevents immigrants from living full lives. This historical comparison serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of racist fervor and forced removals in American society.</p>

          <p>In his new book, researcher Elliot Haspel argues that advocates for affordable child care should reframe the issue as a fundamental right, similar to public education, rather than just an economic necessity for working parents. Haspel contends that the economic argument lacks the moral weight to achieve transformative policy change. Instead, he suggests focusing on how universal child care supports core American values like family stability, community strength, and even national security. This approach, he believes, could build a broader coalition of support by appealing to people who do not currently have young children but have a vested interest in a thriving society.</p>

The piece argues that the true "root cause" of the war is Russia's imperialist inability to accept that former colonies like Ukraine have the right to self-determination.

This conversion is permitted under a state law, SB 1211, designed to encourage the creation of affordable housing, which does not require landlords to replace demolished parking. The tenants' protest, which involves occupying the garage, highlights the conflict between California's housing density goals and the existing needs of residents.</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been publicly ranked in league tables based on their performance across seven key areas, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management. Specialist hospitals, such as Moorfields Eye Hospital, secured the top positions, while Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn was ranked at the bottom, partly due to major structural issues with its buildings. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are intended to increase transparency and public choice. However, some trusts have questioned the metrics used, arguing that financial constraints can unfairly lower the ranking of a hospital providing good clinical care.</p>

          <p>A group of over 40 polar scientists has issued a warning that geoengineering techniques aimed at cooling the Arctic and Antarctic are dangerous and unlikely to be effective. These controversial methods, such as artificially thickening sea ice or releasing reflective particles into the atmosphere, could cause severe environmental damage and distract from the urgent need to reduce fossil fuel emissions. The researchers argue that the only proven way to limit global warming is to achieve net-zero emissions. They express concern that promoting these unproven technologies creates a false hope for a quick fix, undermining essential decarbonization efforts.</p>

          <p>A new Florida law that took effect on July 1, 2025, requires nearly all healthcare professionals regulated by the Department of Health to undergo fingerprint-based national background checks for both initial licensing and renewals. Previously, many professions, including pharmacists and dentists, were not required to be fingerprinted, and existing licensees were on an honor system to self-report convictions. The legislation expands the list of disqualifying criminal offenses and aims to enhance patient safety by ensuring the integrity of the healthcare workforce. The move is expected to hold professionals with criminal records more accountable.</p>

The order directs civilians to move south toward Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone, emphasizing that remaining in the city is "extremely dangerous." This directive follows the Israeli government's approval of a plan to take control of the city as part of its stated objective to eliminate Hamas. Many residents remain trapped due to the high costs of evacuation and a severe shortage of space in safe zones.</p>

          <p>Nepali Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli has resigned following escalating anti-government protests that turned deadly, with security forces killing at least 19 people. The demonstrations, initially sparked by a ban on several social media platforms, evolved into a widespread movement against government corruption and nepotism, led largely by the country's youth. Despite the lifting of the social media ban, protests continued, with demonstrators setting fire to the residences of senior politicians and the parliament building. The resignation aims to pave the way for a political solution to the crisis gripping the nation.</p>

          <p>New results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show a decline in U.S. student achievement, with eighth-graders' science scores and twelfth-graders' math and reading scores falling since 2019. The scores for the lowest-performing twelfth-grade students have reached historic lows, continuing a downward trend that began over a decade ago. This is the first NAEP release since the Trump administration implemented significant budget and staffing cuts at the U.S. Education Department's research arm, which oversees the tests. The concerning results have prompted calls for focused action to accelerate student learning across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent law, which includes approximately $900 billion in cuts to Medicaid spending over a decade, is projected to significantly impact children's hospitals. These institutions rely heavily on Medicaid, which covers nearly half of their patients, and stand to lose billions in supplemental payments used to offset low reimbursement rates. Hospital officials warn that these funding reductions could force them to cut essential services and staff, affecting care for the nation's most vulnerable children. While proponents of the cuts claim they target fraud and non-working adults, the law's provisions will directly affect hospital revenue streams dedicated to pediatric care.</p>

          <p>At a virtual BRICS summit, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called on member nations—Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa—to address significant trade imbalances with New Delhi. India's largest trade deficits are with its BRICS partners, including a record $99.21 billion deficit with China. The call came as the bloc presented a united front against U.S. tariffs, which President Trump has imposed on several member countries. While China and Russia view BRICS as a geopolitical alliance, India has consistently focused on the bloc's economic potential, pushing for smoother trade flows and stronger financial cooperation.

          <p>Protests at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia were met with a violent police response, including the use of tear gas, stun grenades, and batons against demonstrators. President Aleksandar Vucic praised the police for a "professionally executed job," accusing protesters of attacking officers first, a claim disputed by witnesses who described the demonstration as peaceful. Human rights observers have condemned the police actions as an excessive and indiscriminate use of force intended to intimidate dissent. The crackdown signals a shift toward open repression and has raised concerns about the erosion of democratic freedoms under Vucic's government.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market but stopped short of ordering the company to be broken up, a decision influenced by the recent rise of artificial intelligence. The judge, Amit Mehta, noted in his opinion that the emergence of generative AI has fundamentally changed the competitive landscape of the search engine business. While Google will face penalties like sharing information with rivals, the court acknowledged that AI chatbots from competitors like OpenAI present a credible future threat to Google's dominance. This "new reality" was a key factor in the less severe-than-expected outcome of the landmark antitrust case.</p>
