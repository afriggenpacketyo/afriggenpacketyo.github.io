          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 with metastasis to the bone.

          <p>Israel has announced it will permit a "basic amount of food" into Gaza after a 10-week blockade, aiming to prevent a famine crisis as it expands ground operations against Hamas. This decision follows increased military activity, including strikes on a hospital and refugee camp, resulting in numerous casualties. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are still trying to reach a ceasefire agreement in Qatar, but a senior Hamas source told the BBC that "no breakthrough or progress has been achieved so far in the ongoing negotiations in Doha due to continued Israeli intransigence". The ongoing conflict has raised concerns about humanitarian conditions and the safety of civilians in Gaza.</p>

AD leader Luis Montenegro has ruled out forming a coalition with the far-right Chega party, suggesting that the AD will likely need to forge deals with smaller parties to secure a majority in parliament.

          <p>The Supreme Court is evaluating Trump v CASA, a case that could potentially redefine American citizenship based on the 14th Amendment. The central question revolves around whether the children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders should be granted automatic citizenship. This review challenges over a century of precedent, which has generally interpreted the 14th Amendment to grant citizenship to almost everyone born on American soil, with limited exceptions.</p>

          <p>Federal and local authorities have launched an investigation into the crash of a Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, into the Brooklyn Bridge. The incident resulted in the deaths of two people and injuries to at least 19 others, prompting questions about the cause of the collision and whether federal cuts may have played a role. Senator Schumer has raised concerns about potential dysfunction within the Coast Guard due to the Trump administration's actions, including a hiring freeze and the removal of Admiral Linda Fagan from her duties as commandant. Officials are also assessing damage to the bridge's monitoring system.</p>
