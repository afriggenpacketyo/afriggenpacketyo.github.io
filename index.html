          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analyst predictions. While AWS remains the market leader in cloud infrastructure, it faces growing competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher cloud growth rates. The division remains a significant profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company's larger market share and emphasized its commitment to security, contrasting AWS's performance with recent security issues faced by competitors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order adjusting 'reciprocal' tariffs for numerous countries, with new rates ranging from 10% to 41% set to take effect on August 7. The order introduces a significant 40% tariff on all goods determined to be transshipped to evade duties, a move seen as targeting China's trade practices. While some Asian nations like Thailand and Malaysia saw their proposed rates lowered, others such as Syria and Switzerland face steep increases. Analysts expressed concern over continued economic uncertainty, noting that the new rules could be altered at any time. (not investment advice)</p>

Similarly, Thailand's finance minister expressed that the new 19% rate reflects a close partnership with the U.S. and helps maintain economic competitiveness. In contrast, Taiwan's president noted that while its new 20% tariff is lower than a previous proposal, negotiations are still underway to reduce it further.</p>

          <p>An office cleaner at 345 Park Avenue has shared her harrowing experience of coming face-to-face with the gunman who killed four people in the Midtown Manhattan building. Sebije Nelovic, 65, was working on the 33rd floor when she heard gunshots and was confronted by the shooter, who pointed an AR-15-style rifle at her. She identified herself as a cleaner and managed to run and hide in a closet for hours while the attack continued. The shooting is believed to have been an attempt to target the NFL headquarters, but the gunman went to the wrong floor.</p>

They also criticized President Trump's recent comment that Epstein had 'stolen' Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, asserting that she was a person who was actively recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell, not an object.

          <p>For the first time since 2017, annual undergraduate tuition fees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, with maintenance loans also increasing to help with living costs. The adjustment comes after universities warned of severe funding pressures due to years of frozen fees and high inflation, with many projecting financial deficits. The increase has been criticized for placing a greater burden on students, who already face sharply rising accommodation costs. Under new loan repayment rules, recent graduates are expected to pay back more over a longer period than their predecessors.</p>

General Manager Perry Minasian defended the decision, stating the goal is to provide the team's young core with the experience of playing meaningful, competitive games in August and September. This strategy contrasts with other teams in a similar position who opted to trade away assets to build for the future. Critics argue the move is shortsighted for a team that has not made the playoffs in a decade and needs a deeper organizational rebuild.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interspecies hybridization event involving a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, as its closest living wild relative does not produce starchy tubers. The research indicates that the ancient tomato provided a key gene for tuber formation, while the other species contributed a gene that controlled the growth of the underground stems. This finding illustrates how hybridization can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and species.</p>

These tankers conduct ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, often turning off their transponders and obscuring their identification to avoid detection. This illicit trade is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, undermining U.S. efforts to curb its nuclear program.

          <p>Despite Amazon's stock falling after its latest earnings report, some analysts are reiterating a buy rating and viewing the dip as a buying opportunity. The company exceeded revenue and profit expectations, but a modest beat from its AWS cloud division and mixed guidance for the next quarter disappointed investors. The analysis argues that the long-term investment thesis remains intact, pointing to continued strong growth in high-margin areas like AWS and advertising. The focus remains on Amazon's ability to lower costs and expand margins, which are seen as key drivers for future stock appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing trend among teenagers using small, discreet caffeine pouches is causing concern for health experts in the U.S., who fear it could soon spread to the UK. These pouches, placed in the mouth, deliver a rapid and potent dose of caffeine, with some containing as much as two cups of coffee. Influencers on social media are promoting the products for enhancing gym performance or academic alertness. Experts warn that young people have lower caffeine tolerance and could easily consume dangerous amounts, leading to adverse effects like rapid heart rate, anxiety, and, in rare cases, overdose.</p>

          <p>The White House has formally authorized a new schedule of tariffs, raising the rate on Canadian goods to 35% and setting duties ranging from 10% to 40% for dozens of other trading partners.

The order confirms recently announced rates for key partners, such as 15% for the EU and Japan, and 20% for Taiwan.

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is contemplating a travel advisory for China due to a significant surge in Chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne illness. China has reported over 5,000 cases since last month, with the majority concentrated in the southern province of Guangdong. The virus is transmitted by infected mosquitos and typically causes symptoms such as fever and severe joint pain, along with potential headaches and rashes. The rising number of infections has prompted health authorities to monitor the situation closely as it poses a risk to travelers in the region.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major cities that have long been engines of China's economic growth, are reporting a slowdown in their GDP performance. Analysts attribute the simultaneous decline to a combination of weakening global demand, which has hurt exports, and a domestic property market downturn that has suppressed investment. In Shenzhen, fixed-asset investment and real estate development have seen significant year-on-year drops. The slowdown in these critical economic pillars for Guangdong province signals broader challenges for China as it navigates global supply chain uncertainties and sluggish domestic consumption.</p>

          <p>Social media platforms like X and Reddit are blocking a wide range of content, including news about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, for users who have not verified their age, in an effort to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act. The law, which aims to protect minors from harmful material, has led to the restriction of public interest content, such as parliamentary debates on sexual assault. Experts warn that companies, facing heavy fines for non-compliance, are over-applying the law, risking the suppression of legitimate public debate and creating a chilling effect on free speech.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy to make its main civil service internship scheme exclusively available to university students from 'lower socio-economic backgrounds.' This change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the number of working-class individuals in Whitehall to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. The decision is based on parental occupation, and successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. This move is part of a broader effort to diversify the civil service and locate more senior roles outside of London.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has outlined a plan to potentially call a special election on November 4, asking voters to approve new congressional maps. This move is a direct response to President Trump's efforts to have Republican-controlled states redraw their districts to secure a House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. Newsom cast the strategy as a defensive measure to ensure fair elections, stating he will not 'sit back' while the rules are changed. The new maps would be in effect until 2030, after which California would revert to its independent redistricting commission system.</p>
