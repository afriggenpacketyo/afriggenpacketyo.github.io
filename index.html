        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aston Villa plans to lodge a formal complaint with the Premier League following a controversial refereeing decision during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United, which ultimately cost them a Champions League spot. The club is upset that referee Thomas Bramall disallowed a goal by Morgan Rogers, a decision that VAR couldn't overturn because the whistle had already blown. Villa's director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, expressed concerns about Bramall's inexperience for such a crucial match, questioning why more seasoned referees weren't selected. Unai Emery, the Villa boss, acknowledged the mistake but emphasized the need to accept it, highlighting the clear evidence shown on television.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to leave Jack Grealish out of Manchester City's squad for their final Premier League game, amid speculation about the midfielder's future with the club. Despite securing Champions League qualification with a 2-0 victory over Fulham, Guardiola addressed questions about Grealish's absence, emphasizing that it wasn't personal and that he fought for Grealish to join and remain at the club. He deflected further inquiries about Grealish's future, stating that such matters are for Txiki Begiristain, Hugo Viana, and the agents to handle, hinting at potential summer changes to the squad. Guardiola suggested that the squad is too big and failed to win a trophy for the first time in eight years.</p>

          <p>Kyle Larson's attempt to complete "the double" ended prematurely when he crashed out of the Indianapolis 500, amidst a series of bizarre incidents that marked the race. Ryan Hunter-Reay led at the halfway point, as the race was marred by multiple crashes, including Scott McLaughlin's on the warm-up lap and Marco Andretti's on the first lap. Alexander Rossi's pit stop ended in flames, while Robert Shwartzman lost control entering his pit stall, injuring crew members. Despite the setback, Larson headed to Charlotte to participate in the Coca-Cola 600, while Josef Newgarden aimed to become the first driver to win three consecutive Indy 500s from the last row.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries. The Ukrainian Air Force reported shooting down about two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones, but the attacks have strained Ukraine's air defenses and caused significant devastation, particularly in poorly protected western and southern regions. The escalation of violence has intensified despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations, with Ukrainian civilian deaths rising since February.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," asserting they have a "moral component" because those who can work but refuse are "defrauding the system." Johnson argued that these requirements, mandating 20 hours a week of work, job training, or volunteering, will benefit individuals and communities. However, critics point out that 190,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid coverage under these new rules, and Senator Josh Hawley has called the bill "morally wrong and politically suicidal." Johnson insists the bill does not cut Medicaid but addresses fraud and abuse, strengthening the program for those who need it most (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Amid growing concerns about the Trump administration's commitment to protecting the judiciary, federal judges are contemplating creating their own armed security force. This proposal arose at a meeting where judges expressed fears that the Justice Department, under Trump's influence, might withdraw protection from judges ruling against his policies. Currently, the US Marshals Service, managed by the Justice Department, is responsible for judicial security. The proposed shift would place the marshals under the direct control of the Chief Justice, aiming to ensure judicial independence and safety in the face of increasing threats and political pressure.</p>

Salgado's family stated that through his camera lens, he tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world. He contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 while working on his GÃ©nesis project in Indonesia, and complications from this illness eventually led to his severe leukemia. The Instituto Terra, founded by Salgado and his wife, noted that his lens revealed the world and its contradictions, while his life embodied the power of transformative action.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times questions the Supreme Court's recent decisions that appear to be granting President Trump more power. The author, Kate Shaw, argues that the court's intervention in a case involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards effectively allowed President Trump to neutralize independent expertise in the executive branch. Shaw criticizes the court's decision as radical, as it effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, potentially enabling the consolidation of power in the presidency. The author suggests that the Supreme Court's actions risk emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional order.</p>

          <p>A Republican senator has indicated that President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" faces significant resistance in the Senate, potentially halting its progress unless substantial changes are made. Senator Ron Johnson criticized the bill for increasing the deficit and not doing enough to cut spending, urging a return to pre-pandemic spending levels. The bill's passage in the House was narrow, and any Senate modifications would require another House vote, creating a delicate balance for Speaker Johnson. Another point of contention is the bill's raising of the debt ceiling, which some GOP senators prefer to address separately, while Speaker Johnson insists the bill is a pro-growth investment.</p>

The party faces structural challenges, including a Senate map tilted to the right and an Electoral College influenced by population shifts to red states.

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer for the movie "Rust," has been released from prison after serving 14 months for involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Gutierrez was found guilty of reckless handling of firearms and ammunition, though she denied bringing live bullets to the set. Alec Baldwin, who also faced charges, had his case dismissed, and assistant director David Halls received a suspended sentence. With Gutierrez's release, the criminal phase of the "Rust" saga concludes, though civil lawsuits remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Rwanda's President Kagame faces international condemnation for supporting the M23 rebels in eastern Congo, leading to comparisons with Vladimir Putin. Kagame's actions, including the storming of Goma, have left diplomats struggling to understand his motives, especially given his history as a Western-backed leader. Western nations, including Britain, had previously overlooked Kagame's abuses due to his role in stabilizing Rwanda and supporting Western interests, but his recent actions have triggered a reassessment. The situation underscores the complex interplay of security concerns, mineral greed, and regional power dynamics in eastern Congo.</p>

He argued that the administration's orders are designed to indoctrinate rather than educate, restricting legitimate areas of inquiry and undermining academic freedom.

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly LNG, raising concerns about "greenwashing." While leading the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) to promote net-zero emissions, Japan's investments in LNG are seen as a transitional fuel, conflicting with studies showing LNG's higher emissions compared to coal. Critics argue that Japan's strategy benefits its economy by securing LNG access and resale opportunities, while potentially hindering renewable energy transitions in partner countries like Indonesia.

Unlike stricter or softer approaches, it prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, seeing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, and take responsibility after conflicts. This approach aims to create an environment where children feel safe expressing big emotions and showing up as their authentic selves, fostering a calm and steady authority.</p>
