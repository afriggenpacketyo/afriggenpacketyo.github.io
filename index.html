          <h2>Study Links Ultraprocessed Food Consumption to Increased Mortality</h2>

          <p>A Brazilian-led study analyzing dietary surveys from eight countries has found a direct correlation between the consumption of ultraprocessed foods and premature death rates. The research emphasizes that countries with strong food cultures tend to have lower rates of death linked to these products. The study suggests that public policy changes, such as taxes on unhealthy foods and incentives for diverse, organic farming, are essential for improving long-term health outcomes by promoting healthier food systems. The US is encouraging food manufacturers to switch from artificial to natural additives, aligning with global efforts to reduce the negative impacts of ultraprocessed foods.</p>

          <p>Everton Blair, a Democrat, is challenging 12-term Representative David Scott, citing concerns about the age and responsiveness of current congressional leadership. Blair criticized Scott's demeanor during a town hall event and highlighted the recent deaths of Democratic members as evidence of a need for younger representation. Blair's campaign reflects a broader trend of younger candidates challenging established lawmakers, a phenomenon dubbed the 'Biden effect.' The primary for Georgia's 13th District, a solidly Democratic seat, also includes state Senator Emanuel Jones.</p>

          <p>Millions of people in Spain, Portugal, and parts of France experienced widespread power outages due to an unspecified issue with the electricity grid. The Spanish government convened an emergency crisis meeting, and Red Eléctrica, Spain's national electricity grid operator, is working to restore power, estimating full restoration within 6 to 10 hours. Airports are experiencing significant delays, and authorities are urging people to stay home. Initial reports suggest the outage may have originated outside of Portugal, potentially in Spain, although investigations are ongoing.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Spain and Portugal, impacting their capitals and causing disruptions to subway systems, phone lines, traffic signals, and ATMs. Red Eléctrica, the Spanish power distributor, estimates it could take up to 10 hours to restore power, while a Portuguese electricity grid operator suggests full restoration in Portugal could take as long as a week. The Portuguese grid operator attributes the outage to a rare atmospheric phenomenon in Spain caused by extreme temperature variations. However, the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center has stated that there is no sign the outage was due to a cyberattack.</p>

          <p>U.S. agriculture exporters are reporting significant financial losses due to global backlash against President Trump's tariffs, particularly a decline in Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC) describes the situation as a 'full-blown crisis,' citing cancelled export orders and potential layoffs. Data indicates China made its largest cancellation of pork orders since 2020, and exporters of wood pulp and grass seed have also reported cancellations. Port of Oakland officials warn that a tariff-induced downturn in cargo volume could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that gold prices, which have already surpassed $3,000 per ounce, could continue to rise due to economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable market performance. Factors such as bank failures, potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, and ongoing trade tensions are driving investors to safe-haven assets like gold. While reaching $4,000 per ounce is possible, it would require significant market shifts, such as the Federal Reserve dropping interest rates to zero. Despite the potential for pullbacks, experts recommend a long-term investment mindset when considering gold.</p>

          <p>Settling a debt, which involves paying less than the full amount owed, can have mixed effects on your credit score. In the short term, it may not improve your score and could even cause it to dip because settled accounts are typically marked as 'settled' rather than 'paid in full' on your credit report. However, if the account was already severely delinquent, settling the debt can be a step toward rebuilding credit. Over time, maintaining good financial habits can help your score recover, and settling debt can free up funds to stay current on other obligations.</p>

          <p>Edward Spencer, 19, was sentenced to two years in a youth offenders institution after admitting to causing the deaths of three teenagers in a car crash near Shipston-on-Stour. The court heard that Spencer had a history of 'showing off' at the wheel and was speeding at 64mph before the crash. The crash also resulted in life-changing injuries for two children in the other vehicle. Bereaved mothers are supporting graduated driver licensing and the use of black box technology to prevent dangerous driving.</p>

While some concerns have been soothed by a temporary pause on tariffs, uncertainty remains, and analysts warn of further potential downside.

However, the author argues that the rise of AI, which automates many white-collar jobs, may render IQ less relevant, undermining the very basis of the MAGA coalition's ideology.</p>

          <h2>Immigrant Workers Face Exploitation and Hazardous Conditions Cleaning Up Wildfire-Stricken LA</h2>

          <p>Immigrant workers cleaning up after wildfires in Los Angeles are facing exploitative contracts and hazardous conditions, often without proper training or protective equipment. Many workers are exposed to toxic materials like lead, asbestos, and carcinogens without adequate protection, risking long-term health issues. Advocates say workers fear speaking out about conditions due to concerns about wage theft and potential deportation. The vulnerability of immigrant workers is exacerbated by a lack of enforcement of safety regulations and the rush to rebuild communities.</p>

          <p>Congress returns from a two-week recess with Republicans aiming to advance President Trump's agenda, including a massive budget plan to extend tax cuts and raise the debt ceiling. Committees are tasked with drafting legislation reconciling spending with new budget goals, facing a May 9 deadline. Democrats are rallying against the GOP budget plan, warning of cuts to programs like Medicaid. The timeline for passing the entire package by Memorial Day may slip, but pressure is mounting due to the Treasury Department's estimate of the 'X-date' for potential default.</p>
