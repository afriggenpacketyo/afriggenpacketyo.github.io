          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating a sophisticated drug trafficking operation across southeast England. Deborah Mason recruited her children and other family members to transport cocaine with a street value up to £80 million, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat. The Metropolitan Police conducted a seven-month surveillance operation, tracking the gang's activities from ports to various cities. The judge highlighted her leading role in the criminal enterprise, noting she corrupted her own family for financial gain while receiving state benefits.</p>

          <p>Syria's interim government announced it will deploy a new military force to stop deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities in the southern Suweida province, where over 700 people have reportedly been killed. The announcement follows accusations that government troops previously deployed were responsible for killing Druze civilians. Amid the escalating conflict, the US ambassador to Turkey stated that Israel and Syria have agreed to a ceasefire, though neither country has publicly confirmed it. The UN has expressed alarm over credible reports of widespread human rights violations, including summary executions by multiple armed groups and security forces.</p>

          <p>A man from Cardiff who suffered severe injuries while protecting a friend and her baby from three dogs described the lasting mental and financial toll of the attack, including nightmares and an £8,000 loss in earnings. His story is part of a broader report on the rising number of dog attacks in the UK, with new data showing thousands have sought medical treatment in recent years. Police forces in England and Wales recorded over 32,500 offenses in 2024, a 4% increase from the previous year. Survivors and medical experts highlight the need for long-term support, as victims often face extensive reconstructive surgery and psychological challenges.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The novel approach uses gene therapy tools to generate anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body, eliminating the complex and expensive external manufacturing process. A study published in The Lancet details the successful treatment of four patients with multiple myeloma using this in-vivo technique. This innovation could dramatically reduce the cost of CAR-T therapy, which currently can exceed one million yuan (US$139,200) per treatment, making it potentially accessible to a much wider range of patients globally.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for parts of southern England, including London, forecasting torrential rain and thunderstorms that could lead to dangerous flash floods. Following a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and unable to absorb water, forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours. The severe weather is expected to cause significant disruption to transportation, power outages, and potential flooding of homes and businesses. This alert highlights the increased risk of extreme weather events, as the heavy rainfall on parched earth exacerbates the potential for rapid and severe surface water flooding.</p>

The move comes after Moraes issued orders requiring Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and prohibiting him from social media use over allegations he sought foreign interference from President Trump. The article details a significant diplomatic escalation, with the Trump administration actively defending Bolsonaro and criticizing Brazil's judicial system. Bolsonaro has described the court's actions as a "supreme humiliation" and denied any wrongdoing in the case related to an alleged coup plot.</p>

          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate falls to the lowest level ever recorded, with women now averaging just 1.18 babies. Small towns like Fregona are facing extinction, with shrinking populations, closing businesses, and schools at risk of shutting down due to a lack of children. Despite government initiatives like cash bonuses, many Italians find the support insufficient to overcome the challenges of high living costs and a lack of affordable childcare. This long-term trend is forcing some companies to create their own solutions, like shared creches, and raises contentious questions about the need for increased immigration to sustain the economy.</p>

He has been working to overcome a history of injuries and mental blocks by focusing more on being athletic and competitive rather than overthinking his mechanics.

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers indicates that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, may inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up metastasis to other organs. The findings, published in a peer-reviewed journal, offer a possible explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience a spread of the disease to their lungs after successful initial treatment. The research team also discovered that combining specific drugs with chemotherapy could inhibit this awakening process in mice. A clinical trial based on these findings is already underway with breast cancer patients, aiming to develop strategies to counteract this detrimental side effect.</p>

The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, which they calculate would nearly double the force and allow for much heavier projectiles.

          <p>A California state audit has revealed that the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing, hindering its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The audit found a 32% vacancy rate, leading to the agency closing complaint and accident cases without proper on-site inspections and failing to adequately document potential violations. When fines were issued, they were sometimes lower than required and were further reduced without clear rationale. While Cal/OSHA states it has recently reduced its vacancy rate, experts argue that chronic understaffing has crippled its enforcement capabilities for years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal over an article claiming he sent a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. The lawsuit, which also names the article's reporters, alleges the story falsely and maliciously linked Trump to the disgraced financier by describing a crude, hand-drawn card. Trump vehemently denies writing the letter and has called the newspaper a "pile of garbage." A spokesperson for the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones, stated they have full confidence in their reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being pulled into an MRI machine at a medical facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress, defying orders to stay out. The powerful magnetic force of the machine reportedly pulled the chain around his neck, drawing him in and causing fatal injuries. Medical experts emphasize that strict safety protocols are in place for MRI scans precisely to prevent such catastrophic incidents, as the magnets can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce terms reportedly include the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of 18 others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes as the director of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency visited Washington to discuss potential plans for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. A Hamas spokesperson indicated the group favors an interim truce but may revert to demanding a full deal.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered a shipment of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a larger aid package to support the country's defense against Russia's invasion. The tanks are part of a A$245 million ($160 million) contribution, with most of the 49 promised vehicles having already arrived in Ukraine. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over A$1.5 billion in total aid, including ammunition and defense equipment, since the conflict began. The Australian Defence Minister stated the tanks will make a significant contribution to Ukraine's fight against what Canberra has labeled an illegal and immoral invasion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War by daydreaming about a carousel in a mountain meadow has brought that vision to life. Scott Harrison, who battled PTSD after his service, spent 26 years building the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, hand-carving its unique animals. The carousel, which opened in 2010 as a nonprofit, was conceived from a memory of a music box his sister sent him during the war, which provided a mental escape from the brutality. Now, his creation has delighted over a million people and has become a source of profound healing and joy for Harrison himself.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he believes up to five jets were shot down during the recent military hostilities between India and Pakistan, which flared up after an attack in Kashmir. Speaking at a White House dinner, Trump did not specify which country's aircraft he was referring to. During the conflict, both nuclear-armed nations made conflicting claims about aerial combat losses before a ceasefire was announced in May. Trump has previously claimed credit for de-escalating the situation through U.S. intervention, a position that India has disputed, maintaining that such matters must be resolved directly between the two countries without outside involvement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bipartisan legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, which supporters claim will facilitate faster and cheaper transactions while strengthening the dollar's role. The administration hailed the law as a significant step in bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system and a validation for the crypto community. This legislation is intended to provide clear guardrails and consumer protections for the growing stablecoin market. (not investment advice)</p>
