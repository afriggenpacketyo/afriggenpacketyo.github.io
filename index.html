          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in an ABC News interview that he is not ruling out targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, arguing it would de-escalate conflict. Netanyahu dismissed reports that President Trump rejected a prior Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei. He characterized Iran as a regime terrorizing the Middle East and pursuing nuclear weapons, asserting Israel is preventing nuclear war. He also addressed Republicans opposed to supporting Israel's strikes, emphasizing Iran's threat to the world. The State Department has classified all of Israel and the West Bank as "Level 4: Do Not Travel."</p>

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that the ethnicity of perpetrators in grooming gangs has been largely ignored by authorities. The report indicates that ethnicity data is missing for two-thirds of grooming gang members, hindering accurate national assessments. However, local data from three police forces suggests a disproportionate number of suspects from Asian ethnic backgrounds are involved in group-based child sexual exploitation. The report criticizes the fear of being labeled racist as a factor preventing organizations from addressing the issue effectively. The government has pledged to follow the report's recommendations, including mandatory data collection on ethnicity and nationality in child sexual abuse cases.</p>

          <p>As military hostilities continue between Israel and Iran, an analysis of each country's use of financial instruments amid geopolitical tensions is warranted. While Israel is publicly known to have no Bitcoin, Iran could be utilizing Bitcoin in its monetary pursuits, as Tehran Times reports indicate that Iran has often used crypto as a source of fighting Western economic "terrorism." Reports also indicate Iran has been utilizing its energy surplus to mine Bitcoin. The Central Bank of Iran declared that retail transactions will use the digital rial, a state-backed stablecoin.

          <p>Israel's military has achieved air superiority over Iran, enabling the use of cheaper weapons for strikes. Degraded Iranian air defenses mean Israeli aircraft can use glide bombs on targets, while Iran retaliates with more expensive ballistic missiles. Israeli fighter jets have struck targets deep within Iran, underscoring their ability to operate largely uncontested. Iran's missile and drone attacks force Israel to expend valuable air defenses, adding to the financial toll. Operation Rising Lion, aimed at degrading Iran's nuclear program, has been initiated.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies and ByteDance are planning major investments in Brazil's cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence sectors. Huawei is set to announce a deal with Dataprev to use its data centers and is in talks with Edge UOL for cloud services. The expansions come as the United States has increased warnings about Chinese investments in critical tech infrastructure across Latin America. These warnings cite risks of data theft, surveillance, and strategic leverage.</p>
