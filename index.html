            <p>Bank of America reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' forecasts, driven by robust net interest income and trading revenue. Profit increased by 11% to $7.4 billion, or 90 cents per share, while revenue rose by 5.9% to $27.51 billion. The bank's net interest income benefited from reduced deposit costs and higher-yielding investments.

            <p>Kimberly Sullivan, accused of holding her stepson captive for 20 years, is appealing a judge's decision requiring her to wear a GPS ankle monitor while on bail.

The state claims Sullivan is a flight risk due to the potential for significant incarceration and new witness testimonies. Sullivan's lawyers contend the modification was based on public attention rather than genuine concerns about her willingness to appear in court.</p>

            <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton criticizes President Trump's trade policies, arguing that they are alienating allies and strategically benefiting China. Bolton contends that Trump's sweeping global tariffs, which impact allies as well as rivals, undermine the U.S.'s credibility and create a better strategic position for China. He suggests that a united front with allies would be more effective in addressing trade issues with China. Bolton views the tariff policy as both an economic and strategic blunder that could significantly harm the United States if not reversed.</p>

            <p>LVMH shares plummeted after reporting an unexpected decline in first-quarter sales, causing it to temporarily lose its position as the world's largest luxury firm to Hermès. The sales drop was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China, particularly for cognac. The luxury sector is facing headwinds from U.S. President Donald Trump's volatile trade policy and the potential impact of tariffs on input costs and consumer demand. Analysts suggest that the sector's recovery may be delayed by economic uncertainty and trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

While not every financial planner thinks physical cash is essential, some say it's wise to keep a small amount on hand in case of power outages, natural disasters or payment disruptions. It is advised to keep $500 to $1,000 in cash for unforeseen issues like a hurricane, but to not go overboard with physical cash, since it's not FDIC-insured and doesn't earn interest.

The team, which was set to survey 210 households about enduring challenges facing residents of Asheville's Buncombe County, was cut due to Elon Musk's DOGE-directed layoffs of about 10,000 staff at federal health agencies. The suspended Buncombe County survey is just one example of the many local and state efforts supported by federal health agencies caught up in the Trump administration's deep cuts to government staffing and spending. The impact of the cuts on the North Carolina project were immediate, and it is feared that the downsizing will affect both federal and local responses to any future disasters.</p>

The report emphasizes that rare earths are crucial for a range of advanced defense technologies and are used in types of fighter jets, submarines, missiles, radar systems and drones.

He also blamed former US President Joe Biden for the conflict. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands, but not millions, of people have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.</p>
