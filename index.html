          <p>A helicopter crashed in a Huntington Beach, California parking lot, injuring five people who were subsequently hospitalized. The incident occurred around 2 p.m. local time near Twin Dolphins Drive and Beach Boulevard, with videos showing the wreckage lodged in palm trees. Two individuals were rescued from the helicopter, while three others on the ground sustained injuries, though their conditions remain unknown. The helicopter was linked to a "Cars and Copters" event scheduled for Sunday, and the FAA and NTSB have been notified to investigate the cause of the crash. This article captures the immediate aftermath of the accident and the initial response efforts. Optimism is tempered by the unknown condition of the injured. </p>

          <p>Global energy investment is increasing, yet a crisis of confidence threatens climate policy due to political factors. Companies have cancelled or scaled back clean energy projects in the U.S., resulting in job losses, while major investors are retreating from net-zero alliances. The erosion of political will, driven by populist pressures, is reshaping climate policy worldwide, with leaders framing climate action as incompatible with affordability and energy security. This article emphasizes that the primary obstacle to achieving net-zero ambitions is the systematic dismantling of policy frameworks due to political considerations, rather than technological or financial limitations. The analysis suggests a need for stronger mechanisms to protect climate policy from political cycles. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Trump can remain in the state but are prohibited from patrolling or deploying to protect federal property. The ruling comes after Judge April Perry initially blocked the deployment, stating there was no evidence of a "danger of rebellion" that would warrant invoking the Insurrection Act. The judge granted a temporary restraining order, allowing the troops to stay but restricting their duties until further arguments can be heard. This article details the legal back-and-forth regarding the deployment and the judge's rationale for limiting the National Guard's role. </p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump asserted that he would direct his secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, to use "all available funds" to ensure US military troops are paid despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social platform, claiming he was using his authority as commander-in-chief to bypass the shutdown's impact on military pay. The government shutdown, which began on October 1st, is the first since a 35-day closure during Trump's first term. This article highlights Trump's attempt to address the potential impact of the shutdown on military personnel. </p>
