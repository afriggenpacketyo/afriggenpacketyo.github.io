          <h2>UK Economy Experiences Unexpected Contraction in May</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 02:07:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of economic shrinkage, according to the Office for National Statistics. This downturn defied economists' predictions, who had anticipated a modest growth of 0.1% for the month. The figures indicate a potential slowdown and economic headwinds for the UK, raising concerns about the country's financial stability and growth prospects. The persistent contraction adds pressure on policymakers to address the underlying economic challenges facing the nation.</p>

          <p>A tense confrontation occurred in Ventura County, California, when U.S. Border Patrol agents executed a warrant at a marijuana facility. Protesters gathered to oppose the raid, leading to a standoff where agents deployed crowd-control measures like tear gas and less-lethal rounds. The incident drew sharp criticism from state officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who condemned the "militaristic raids" on farmworkers. Federal officials stated the operation was related to child labor violations, alleging that 10 unaccompanied minors were found at the site, highlighting the complex intersection of immigration, labor, and drug enforcement.</p>

Eadeh, who previously served as the political section chief at the consulate during the 2019 pro-democracy protests, has had her name submitted to Beijing for approval. Her potential appointment comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-China relations, with the role being a key diplomatic post for observing political and economic developments in the region. The final decision now rests with the Chinese government, which must grant its consent for the appointment to proceed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has declared its intention to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to begin on August 1. In a public letter, President Trump linked the new levies to Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States, warning of even higher duties if Ottawa retaliates. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney responded by reaffirming his government's commitment to defending Canadian workers and continuing to collaborate with the U.S. on the fentanyl crisis. This move escalates trade tensions between the two closely-linked economies amid ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>The past week saw a significant escalation in global trade tensions as the Trump administration issued letters to over 20 governments threatening new tariffs by August 1. The proposed rates range from 25% to 50%, targeting key economies like Japan and South Korea, as well as developing nations in Southeast Asia. Specific announcements included a 35% tariff on Canada and a 50% tariff on Brazil, the latter linked to political events in the country. Despite the widespread threats and turmoil, only two trade deals, with the UK and Vietnam, have been secured, leaving global markets in a state of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Global pharmaceutical companies are preparing for significant disruption following President Trump's proposal to impose tariffs of up to 200% on imported drugs. Industry analysts warn that such a steep levy could inflate production costs, squeeze profits, and lead to higher prices and potential shortages for U.S. consumers. While the administration has suggested a grace period of 12 to 18 months, firms like Roche, Bayer, and Novartis say this is insufficient time to relocate complex manufacturing operations to the U.S. The industry is now anxiously awaiting further details while advocating for policies that ensure patient access and affordability.</p>

The ban, which carries a potential fine of up to £1,000, restricts activities like watering gardens and washing cars due to low reservoir levels. Critics argue that the water company should prioritize fixing its infrastructure and stopping widespread waste before imposing restrictions on its customers.</p>

This success persists despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers from buying a Tesla. Norway's robust EV market, supported by strong government incentives and charging infrastructure, continues to make it a key stronghold for the American automaker.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's National Audit Office (NAO) has found that the nation's F-35 stealth jet program is being undermined by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages. While acknowledging the F-35 is a superior aircraft, the NAO described the capability gained from the £11 billion spent so far as a "disappointing return." The report also noted that key weapon system upgrades have been delayed and that the fleet's mission-capable rate is only a third of the target. The Ministry of Defence maintains the program is within budget and that two full squadrons will be ready for deployment by year's end.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has reported to the UN Security Council that there are "reasonable grounds" to believe war crimes are being committed in Darfur, Sudan. The ICC's deputy prosecutor highlighted targeted sexual violence against women and girls as one of the most disturbing findings from its investigation into the conflict between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The war, which began in April 2023, has led to devastating civilian casualties, a worsening famine, and the deliberate withholding of aid. The UN reports that over 150,000 people have died and 12 million have been displaced.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are scheduled to meet at the ASEAN summit in Malaysia, marking a high-level engagement between the two powers. The meeting occurs amid ongoing tensions over trade, Taiwan, and China's support for Russia. Wang Yi criticized the "abuse of tariffs by a certain major country," referencing the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies, which have included threats of high tariffs against several Asian nations. The discussions are expected to cover these contentious issues as both sides navigate a challenging diplomatic and economic relationship.</p>

          <p>Economists are closely awaiting China's first-half economic data to determine if more fiscal stimulus is necessary to counteract external pressures, particularly from U.S. tariffs. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% annual target, concerns remain about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and employment. Many analysts argue that rising trade uncertainties necessitate more forceful government support to stabilize the economy. An adviser to the central bank has also expressed support for a proactive fiscal policy if external shocks trigger a domestic downturn, highlighting the precarious balance China's economy faces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a boom in electric heavy truck sales, which are rapidly gaining market share and curbing the nation's demand for diesel fuel. Driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year. This shift, combined with the rise of LNG-powered trucks and slowing economic growth, has led analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts. The trend is accelerating predictions for when China's overall oil consumption will peak, with some now suggesting it could happen this year.</p>

          <p>The White House is standing by its assessment that the U.S. military's "Operation Midnight Hammer" raid successfully obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities. This defense comes in response to a New York Times report, citing Israeli officials, suggesting that a portion of Iran's near-bomb-grade enriched uranium survived the B-2 bomber strikes. A White House spokesperson reiterated that the operation was a decisive success that made the world safer. The June 21 mission involved a long-range flight from Missouri to strike key Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan with powerful bunker-busting bombs.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that the United States is losing its appeal as a travel destination for many Southeast Asians, with nearly 80% reporting a decline in interest. Unlike Canadian travelers who are deterred by tariffs and exchange rates, Asian travelers cited concerns about potential discrimination, gun violence, and the actions of the Trump administration as primary reasons. While travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines showed increased interest, potentially due to large diaspora populations, a majority of Singaporeans were less interested in visiting. The findings reflect a broader trend of shifting global perceptions of the U.S. as a travel destination.</p>

The judge appeared to question the government's lack of specific evidence justifying its operations, noting the high volume of evidence provided by plaintiffs. A final order is expected soon in the case, which has become a key battleground over the administration's mass deportation strategy.</p>
