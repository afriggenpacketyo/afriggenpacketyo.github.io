          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has reached a new milestone of 3 billion monthly active users, a significant increase from the 2 billion reported in October 2022. This places the photo-sharing app in the same league as Meta's other major platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp. The growth comes after Meta ceased its practice of disclosing individual app user numbers on a quarterly basis in April 2024, instead reporting a combined figure for its family of apps, which reached 3.48 billion daily active people in July.</p>

          <p>Germany is confronting a significant budget crisis that threatens to halt 74 new motorway construction projects and 99 federal highway plans. Despite a €500 billion special fund for infrastructure, the transport ministry's basic budget was unexpectedly cut by €10 billion, creating a projected €15 billion shortfall through 2029. This has sparked intense debate within the German government over prioritizing the renovation of existing crumbling roads and bridges versus funding new construction, with officials now exploring public-private partnerships to address the financial gap.</p>

          <p>Disney is raising the prices for its various streaming packages, with changes taking effect on October 21. The ad-supported Disney+ plan will increase by $2 to $11.99 per month, while the premium ad-free tier will jump by $3 to $18.99 monthly. This move follows a similar price hike in October 2024 and comes as the company faces public criticism over its temporary suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's controversial remarks, which led some subscribers to cancel their service in protest.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex questioning whether the company's invitation to President Donald Trump to its U.S. Open box was an attempt to gain favor and secure exemptions from tariffs. The letter highlights concerns that Rolex may be trying to avoid a 39% levy on Swiss exports announced by the Trump administration. Warren drew parallels to other companies like Apple and Nvidia, suggesting a pattern of corporations cultivating relationships with the president to receive preferential treatment on trade policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has barred Iranian officials attending the UN summit in New York from making purchases at wholesale stores like Costco and from buying luxury goods valued over $1,000. A State Department spokesman described the restrictions as a form of "maximum pressure," aiming to prevent Iran's elites from enjoying a "shopping spree" while their country faces economic hardship. This measure is the latest in a series of U.S. sanctions that have severely impacted Iran's economy by restricting its ability to import goods and export oil.</p>

While such promotions can make vehicles more affordable, they also carry risks as borrowers with lower scores are more likely to default, especially in a challenging economic climate.</p>

Created in 1990 by 118 international artists, the site once fostered a vibrant counterculture but has since been transformed by extensive real estate development, including luxury apartments and hotels. While the alternative communities have been displaced, the gallery remains a major tourist attraction, embodying the complex history of a place that transitioned from a symbol of death and division to one of creative expression.</p>

          <p>Global defense stocks experienced a significant rally after President Donald Trump indicated a major policy shift, stating that Ukraine is in a position to win back all its territory from Russia. This change in rhetoric, which included calling Russia a "paper tiger," contrasted sharply with his previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede land for peace. The market reaction saw shares for European defense firms like Renk, Leonardo, and Saab climb, reflecting investor anticipation of increased military support for Kyiv. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has pushed back against President Trump's recent comments describing Russia as a "paper tiger" engaged in an aimless war, with a spokesperson stating that Russia is more like a "real bear." The response followed Trump's dramatic rhetorical shift suggesting Ukraine could win back all its territory, a statement made after meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Despite the sharp words, Moscow maintained that the relationship between the two leaders remains respectful and that it will continue its military operation to achieve its goals.</p>

          <p>In his speech at the UN General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a stark warning that Russia's aggression will not stop at Ukraine unless it is defeated, citing its influence in Georgia and Belarus. His address came a day after President Trump's unexpected shift in rhetoric supporting a full Ukrainian victory, a change Zelenskyy acknowledged but treated with caution. Speaking in English, he pleaded for continued international support, framing the conflict as a defense of international law against a uniquely dangerous proliferation of modern warfare.</p>

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a critical factor in affordability. As of September 23, 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.39%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.57%, according to Bankrate data. To secure the best possible rates in this elevated environment, financial experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s, and shopping around with multiple lenders to compare terms and fees.

          <p>In an effort to solve Oregon's oldest cold case, authorities have exhumed the remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman found dismembered in a burlap sack in 1946. The investigation had stalled for decades after critical evidence, including the remains, went missing in the 1950s. After recently learning the remains were likely buried in a local cemetery, law enforcement recovered them for advanced forensic testing. Officials are hopeful that modern DNA technology can finally identify the victim and bring resolution to the nearly 80-year-old homicide case.</p>

The speech was framed as a departure from past, more scripted appearances, revealing a president unrestrained by diplomatic norms during his second term and advancing a dark narrative about existential threats to the West.</p>
