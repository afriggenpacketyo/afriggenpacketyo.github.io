Rubio emphasized that neither Russia would take the whole country nor Ukraine would return to pre-2014 borders. Separately, Vance stated the U.S. has presented a fair proposal and awaits a response from both nations, indicating a willingness to withdraw from the process if an agreement is not reached soon.

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports a significant increase in scam job offers sent via text messages, resulting in substantial financial losses for consumers. These scams often involve fraudulent companies and have led to reported losses of $61.2 million in 2024, up from $2 million in 2020. Experts attribute the rise to the immediacy of text messages and economic uncertainty, which makes people more vulnerable.

The comments came as the electric vehicle faces a turbulent year, with shares down nearly 40%, European market share slumping along with deliveries — and the brand under siege with regular protests at showrooms across the U.S.</p>

          <p>The pro-natalism movement, particularly the efforts of figures like Malcolm and Simone Collins, is gaining influence within the Trump administration, aiming to encourage American women to have more babies. Beyond simply increasing the birth rate, the movement seeks to enforce right-wing social values and transform women's roles in American life, pushing them out of the public sphere. While advocating for measures like fertility awareness classes and "baby bonuses," the movement conspicuously avoids addressing the actual needs of American mothers, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare, revealing a focus on regressive gender politics and limited opportunities for women.</p>
