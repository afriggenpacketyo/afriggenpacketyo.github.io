          <p>In this New York Times article, Ezra Klein interviews Jake Tapper about Tapper's new book, "Original Sin," which investigates the alleged cover-up surrounding Joe Biden's declining abilities leading up to the 2024 election. Tapper recounts instances where Biden appeared forgetful and disoriented, including during interviews with Special Counsel Robert Hur. The article highlights the White House's efforts to downplay concerns about Biden's age and cognitive abilities, even as evidence suggested a decline. The discussion also touches on the Democratic Party's reluctance to challenge Biden and the factors that ultimately led to his decision not to seek re-election. The article paints a picture of a party in denial, prioritizing loyalty over the country's best interests, ultimately contributing to the rise of Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift is no longer required to testify in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, as Baldoni's team withdrew the subpoena. Lively's representatives expressed approval, affirming their support against unjust harassment of third parties. The dispute centers around Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni for sexual harassment, retaliation, and emotional distress during the production of "It Ends With Us." Baldoni counter-sued, alleging extortion and defamation, claiming Lively leveraged her friendship with Swift to pressure him during filming. Swift's spokesperson previously stated she had minimal involvement with the film beyond licensing a song.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have fallen to a new low in 2025, averaging 8.23%, presenting a favorable opportunity for homeowners to borrow. This decline occurs despite a pause in federal funds rate reductions, making home equity loans more attractive than personal loans and credit cards. The article advises borrowers to act quickly, as these rates are fixed and protect against potential future increases. It also notes that HELOC rates have been increasing, making home equity loans a more stable option for those needing financing for debt consolidation or other needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration (SSA), Frank Bisignano, told agency staff that he had to Google the position after being offered the job. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, said he was not seeking a government role when approached about leading the SSA. He sought to reassure staff about the agency's future amid leadership turnover and scrutiny from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Bisignano emphasized the importance of adopting a "digital-first" mindset and said he does not intend to implement reductions in force.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article discusses the importance of defending academic freedom, even when controversial or unpopular ideas are presented. Referencing Joseph Alsop's 1953 defense of academic freedom during the McCarthy era, the article draws parallels to current challenges, including the Trump administration's actions against foreign students and the cancellation of visas for viewpoints deemed "bad". It highlights the need to uphold unrestricted freedom of thought and due process, emphasizing that suppressing ideas can lead to broader purges. The piece argues that modern threats to academic freedom may surpass those of the 1950s, and that defending these principles is essential for intellectual progress.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students, finding that the action likely violated their due process rights. The ruling, issued by Judge Jeffrey White, prevents immigration officials from arresting, jailing, or deporting affected students. The case arose after the administration terminated the SEVIS records of students identified under the "Student Criminal Alien Initiative." The judge found the administration's actions to be unlawful and a cause for concern, as they tried to put future SEVIS terminations beyond judicial review.</p>

The decision is expected to face legal challenges and has sparked concerns about the future of clean energy initiatives under the Trump administration, which is also weakening federal emissions standards and cutting climate programs.</p>

Despite the similarities, the quick apprehension of a suspect in the recent case offers the victims' families a sense of closure that was absent in the earlier assassination.</p>
