          <p>President Trump announced the transfer of the federal student loan portfolio and 'special needs' programs from the Education Department to other agencies.  This unexpected move, effective immediately, has reportedly blindsided employees at the Federal Student Aid office, raising questions about the transition process and potential legal implications. The Small Business Administration will manage student loans, while the Department of Health and Human Services will oversee special needs programs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled in favor of Mariah Carey and co-writer Walter Afanasieff, dismissing a $20 million copyright infringement lawsuit.  Songwriters Andy Stone and Troy Powers alleged that Carey's hit song copied their 1989 song of the same title. The judge found insufficient evidence of substantial similarity between the two songs, concluding that the similarities stemmed from common Christmas clich√©s.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Western sanctions imposed on China and Russia have had minimal effect on their respective policies.  While sanctions may create difficulties in implementing certain policies, they haven't significantly altered China's approach to Xinjiang or Russia's actions in Ukraine.
