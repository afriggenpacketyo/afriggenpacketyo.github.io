          <h2>IRS Proposes Allowing Churches to Retain Tax-Exempt Status Despite Political Endorsements</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 06:16:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has indicated that pastors endorsing political candidates should not cause their churches to lose tax-exempt status, effectively carving out an exception to the Johnson Amendment. This move comes via a joint court filing with the National Religious Broadcasters Association, which sued the IRS claiming the 1954 rule violates First Amendment rights. While the IRS has rarely enforced this rule against houses of worship, legal experts suggest this official stance could significantly increase political speech from the pulpit. The change aligns with President Trump's long-stated goal to dismantle the Johnson Amendment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move seen as an attempt to pressure U.K. regulators to approve its long-delayed London listing. The Singapore-based retailer has faced regulatory hurdles in London, particularly concerning risk disclosures, after shifting its focus from a New York IPO due to pushback from U.S. lawmakers. While a London listing would offer international legitimacy, analysts are skeptical that a Hong Kong filing will force the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority to soften its stance. The company also continues to face scrutiny over its commercial practices and an EU investigation into consumer protection breaches.</p>

          <p>A 48-year-old man has been identified as the 140th "stolen grandchild" from Argentina's brutal 1976-1983 military dictatorship, after being born in a clandestine detention center and taken from his mother. The activist group Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo announced the breakthrough, which was confirmed by DNA tests following an anonymous tip. His parents were left-wing activists who were "disappeared" in 1976, and his older sister expressed her joy at the discovery. The group continues to search for hundreds more missing children, though their efforts face funding challenges under the current government.</p>

          <p>Norman Tebbit, a prominent and often controversial cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. A loyal Thatcherite, he was known for his tough stance on trade unions and his forthright political style, which earned him the nickname of a "semi-house trained polecat." Lord Tebbit and his wife were seriously injured in the 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, an event that highlighted his personal courage and stoicism. He served as Conservative Party chairman and led several departments before leaving government in 1987 to care for his wife.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for its third and potentially most widespread heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 33°C (91°F) over the weekend.

The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England, warning of very warm and humid nights. This heatwave is notable for its broad reach, extending further into northern regions than the previous two events of the summer.</p>

          <p>This opinion article recounts a contributor's experience testifying as the lone Democratic witness at a recent House subcommittee hearing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The author argues that conservative lawmakers used the session to advance an anti-DEI agenda, focusing on loaded yes-or-no questions while interrupting attempts to provide nuanced, evidence-based answers about racial inequities. The writer asserts that race has historically influenced hiring, often benefiting white applicants, and that DEI programs are necessary to counteract systemic biases. The piece concludes that such programs aim to redress inequities for various groups, not to practice reverse discrimination.</p>

          <p>The United States is facing a critical shortage of Patriot missile interceptors, with current stockpiles at only about 25% of the level required for the Pentagon's global military plans. This significant depletion, exacerbated by recent deployments to the Middle East and transfers to Ukraine, prompted the Trump administration to temporarily halt a shipment to Kyiv. The decision was reportedly based on a Pentagon munitions tracker indicating that stockpiles of several critical weapons have been below the minimum required levels for years. Although President Trump has since announced that some defensive weapons will resume flowing to Ukraine, the low inventory raises serious concerns about U.S. military readiness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent move to impose tariffs of up to 40% on 14 countries is being interpreted by analysts as a strategic effort to isolate China and bolster the U.S. position ahead of upcoming trade negotiations. The executive order, which extends a pause on "reciprocal" tariffs, targets many of China's key trading partners, creating a sense of being cornered for Beijing's policymakers. This action is viewed as a continuation of a decoupling agenda, aiming to pressure China as the 90-day trade truce from May approaches its expiration in early August. (not investment advice)</p>

Historically, third parties in the U.S. have struggled due to the winner-take-all system, often acting as "spoilers" rather than viable alternatives. Musk, unable to run for president himself, would need to find credible candidates to carry the party's banner. The author suggests Musk's strategy of focusing on a small number of key congressional races could be shrewd, potentially giving an "America Party" faction significant power to shape legislation in a narrowly divided Congress.</p>

          <p>Southern California is set for a significant heatwave this week, with temperatures expected to be up to 10 degrees above normal on Wednesday and Thursday. A high-pressure system is forecast to push temperatures into the 90s and low 100s in the San Fernando, Antelope, and Santa Clarita valleys. The National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for inland areas of San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego counties, where temperatures could reach 104 degrees. Residents are advised to take precautions against heat-related illnesses, though the heat is expected to break by the weekend as onshore breezes return.</p>

          <p>A new report from England's children's commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, warns that some children are living in "Dickensian" poverty, with descriptions of homes infested with rats and a lack of basic necessities. The report is based on the experiences of 128 children and highlights severe issues like food insecurity and poor living conditions. The commissioners for all four UK nations are jointly calling on the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap, which they identify as a root cause of poverty. The government stated it is working on a child poverty strategy, but has not committed to lifting the cap.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in Texas, records show that Kerr County, one of the hardest-hit areas, had discussed implementing a siren-based flood warning system for nearly a decade but never did so. In a 2016 meeting, the former county sheriff strongly advocated for sirens along the Guadalupe River, specifically citing the danger to summer camps, but the plan was not funded. Now, as the death toll surpasses 100, local officials face intense scrutiny over the lack of audible warnings and timely evacuations. Officials have conceded they were caught off guard by the storm's severity, highlighting a critical failure in preparedness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of new potential tariffs on 14 countries has elicited concern and regret from key Asian allies, who are now scrambling to negotiate before an August 1 deadline. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called the threatened 25% levy "truly regrettable," while South Korean leaders vowed to accelerate talks to resolve trade uncertainties over their proposed 20% tariff. Other nations, including Thailand and Malaysia, also expressed shock but remained hopeful for a favorable outcome through continued engagement. The move is seen by some analysts as part of a broader strategy to pressure regional supply chains that involve China. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law allowing local councils in Wales to implement a tourism tax on overnight visitors is expected to pass in the Senedd. The plan would add a small nightly fee to accommodations like hotels and campsites, potentially raising up to £33 million annually to improve tourist destinations. The proposal is supported by the Labour-led government and Plaid Cymru but has faced opposition from the Welsh Conservatives and some business groups, who fear it will deter visitors and harm the economy. If passed, individual councils could decide whether to introduce the levy, with the earliest implementation set for 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

It details widespread and systematic incidents of sexual assault and abuse, and proposes a legal framework for prosecuting these crimes as weapons of war, even without direct attribution to individual perpetrators.

          <p>A rapid nuclear buildup by China and North Korea is fueling fears of a dangerous proliferation cascade in East Asia, with South Korea and Japan potentially developing their own arsenals in response. This long-form article explores how uncertainty about the U.S. security commitment under President Trump is pushing allies to reconsider their non-nuclear stances. Experts warn that if South Korea or Japan, both members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, were to develop weapons, the entire global non-proliferation regime could unravel. This could lead to a world with 15 or 20 nuclear powers, dramatically increasing the risk of a nuclear exchange.</p>

          <p>Women in South Asia are experiencing menopause at a younger age—around 46 to 47 in India and Pakistan—compared to the global average of 45 to 55. This accelerated aging process is linked to a combination of factors, including genetics, chronic health issues, and significant vitamin D deficiencies. Health experts also point to intense societal pressures to have children early, which often leads to women's long-term health being neglected. The cultural focus on fertility sidelines conversations about menopause, leaving many women to navigate its physical and emotional challenges, such as brain fog and mood changes, with little support or information.</p>

The principal reportedly instructed staff to buy the paint, which was clearly marked as inedible, online.

          <p>A blog post by European Central Bank economists warns that the European Union's increasing trade with autocratic regimes may be inadvertently funding their expansionary agendas and creating an existential challenge for the bloc. The analysis shows that despite pledges to a values-based economic policy, EU trade with autocracies steadily rose from 1999 until the sanctions on Russia. This trend is not solely due to China and presents a trade-off, as many resources needed for the green transition are located in countries with autocratic governments. The article suggests this dynamic poses significant reputational and security risks for the EU. (not investment advice)</p>
