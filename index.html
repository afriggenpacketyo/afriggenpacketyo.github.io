          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, is positioned to secure an automatic spot on the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After a strong third round at the Junior PGA Championships, he is tied for second place, with the top two finishers earning automatic bids. Woods shot a 5-under 66, demonstrating significant skill with nine birdies, though he also had four bogeys. This performance continues a successful year for the rising junior, who has yet to make a college commitment.</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule, which has brought a mix of relief and continued uncertainty. Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments after their respective tariff rates were significantly reduced from previously announced levels. In contrast, Taiwan faces a 20% temporary tariff but holds out hope for further reductions through ongoing negotiations. India, having not secured a deal, will face a 25% tariff, highlighting the varied economic impacts of the new U.S. trade policy across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

Reports include an accusation that Israel has caused a famine, the use of a government spy unit to monitor social media posts critical of migrant policies, and Ministry of Justice figures showing a rise in the foreign-born prison population. Other highlighted stories cover the high number of migrant crossings in the English Channel this year and a call from a former Labour official to consider a wealth tax.

          <p>President Trump has officially signed an executive order imposing higher tariffs on dozens of countries, with rates ranging from 10% to 41%. The new duties are set to take effect in seven days, a brief delay intended to allow customs officials time for implementation. The administration has categorized trading partners based on whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with them, assigning higher rates to countries with larger deficits. This move formalizes a key part of the president's trade agenda, though it has drawn criticism for creating economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders star wide receiver Terry McLaurin has officially requested a trade following stalled contract extension negotiations. McLaurin, who is entering the final year of his contract with a base salary of $15.5 million, had previously sat out the start of training camp to avoid fines. The two-time Pro Bowl selection is coming off a career-best season, and his frustration with the lack of a new long-term deal has now escalated. The team's general manager expressed a desire to keep McLaurin, but the trade request signals a significant rift between the player and the franchise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the widespread financial anxiety and exhaustion experienced by millennial women who were encouraged to pursue their passions without adequate financial education. The author contrasts her generation's reality of juggling freelance work and economic instability with her parents' more secure financial milestones at the same age.

UCLA's chancellor called the decision a major loss for the nation, arguing that defunding life-saving research does not address the underlying allegations.

The government stated the hike is in line with inflation, and it comes after universities warned of significant funding pressures that could lead to cuts in staffing and courses. Maintenance loans for living costs have also increased slightly. The change will likely add to the financial burden on students, who already face rising accommodation costs and will repay their loans over a longer period under recent reforms.

          <p>This article critiques the Los Angeles Angels' decision to be modest buyers at the trade deadline, acquiring a few veteran players rather than trading assets to rebuild for the future. Despite having long odds of making the playoffs, the team's general manager stated the goal was to remain competitive and provide young core players with experience in meaningful late-season games. The analysis questions this approach, pointing to the team's decade-long playoff drought and the need to acquire more high-level talent to build a sustainable contender around its emerging young stars.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the executive mansion's grounds. President Trump stated the new facility, which will hold up to 650 people, is a long-needed improvement to host large-scale events without relying on tents on the South Lawn. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will reportedly be funded by the president and other private "patriot donors" as a "gift to the country." This will be the first major structural addition to the White House since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>

          <p>The design software company Figma made a spectacular debut on the stock market, with its share price soaring 250% on the first day of trading, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion.

The successful IPO is a bright spot in the tech market, potentially signaling a more favorable environment for other companies looking to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which provides compensation to victims and could be depleted by next year. The plan proposes raising the money through a split contribution: $9 billion from extending a surcharge on utility customers' monthly bills for another 10 years, and another $9 billion from the shareholders of the state's three largest utilities. The move aims to stabilize the fund as climate change makes wildfires more destructive, but it has drawn criticism from both consumer advocates and utility executives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a legislative hearing, it was revealed that top officials in Kerr County, Texas, were either asleep or out of town when catastrophic flash floods struck over the July 4th weekend. The disaster killed at least 95 people in the county. The emergency management coordinator testified he was ill and in bed, while the sheriff also said he was asleep with no warning of the storm's magnitude. The county's top executive was out of town. This testimony has intensified criticism and raised serious questions about the adequacy of the emergency warning and response systems in the hardest-hit area.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data for the first five months of President Trump's second term shows that the majority of ICE arrests occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of the more than 109,000 arrests, followed by Florida and California. This geographic concentration is attributed to demographics, proximity to the border, and the level of cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Overall, ICE arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period in the previous year under the Biden administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in the journal Cell has uncovered the surprising origin of the potato, tracing it back to a hybridization event with an ancient tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's evolution, as its closest look-alike relative does not produce starchy tubers. The research reveals that a gene from the tomato ancestor was crucial for telling the potato plant to form tubers. This discovery, made by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes, solves a long-standing botanical mystery about one of the world's most important food crops.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new investigation, China is actively evading U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of oil tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. These tankers reportedly turn off their tracking transponders to avoid detection while conducting ship-to-ship oil transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia. This illicit trade is a significant source of revenue for Iran, generating an estimated $70 billion and helping to prop up its regime and fund its nuclear program. Despite U.S. sanctions, this activity appears to be increasing, undermining international pressure on Tehran.</p>

          <h2>Fatal Cornwall Crash Sparks Renewed Calls for Stricter Rules for Older Drivers</h2>

          <p>The daughter of a 79-year-old woman killed in a car crash in Cornwall is calling for an overhaul of the driving regulations for older people in the UK. She argues the current system, which relies on drivers over 70 self-declaring medical conditions every three years, is "unsafe and inadequate." Statistics show older drivers are disproportionately represented in fatal and serious injury collisions, though primarily due to frailty and errors in judgment rather than risky behavior. The article highlights a growing debate over mandatory medical checks and reporting requirements to improve road safety as the population ages.</p>
