            <p>President Trump's tariffs on imports from numerous countries, including a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, have gone into effect, intensifying concerns about a global trade war. The tariffs are intended to force trading partners to negotiate deals that benefit American workers. China has vowed to retaliate, and financial markets have reacted negatively to the increased trade tensions, with Asian and European markets declining. Trump has indicated that he's open to "tailored deals," but Beijing has shown no sign of backing down from the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>India's central bank reduced its policy rate to 6% in an effort to stimulate the country's slowing economic growth. The rate cut occurred as reciprocal tariffs from the U.S. went into effect, imposing a 26% levy on Indian goods. Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra expressed more concern about economic growth than the impact of the tariffs, stating that India is better positioned than other countries to manage the tariff-led hikes due to its smaller trade surplus with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The article examines the potential consequences of a full-scale trade war between the U.S. and China following President Trump's imposition of tariffs exceeding 100% on Chinese imports. It details the significant trade volume between the two nations, the types of goods exchanged, and how retaliatory tariffs could harm consumers in both countries. Beyond tariffs, the article also discusses potential non-tariff measures each country could take, such as China restricting exports of vital metals and the U.S. tightening its technological blockade on China. The analysis also considers how other countries might be affected by the trade conflict.</p>

            <p>President Trump is facing pressure from his allies, supporters, and donors to end the ongoing tariff war, which has disrupted the global economy. Figures like Ken Langone and Bill Ackman have voiced concerns about the negative consequences for the U.S. economy and citizens. Even Elon Musk privately urged Trump against implementing the high tariffs, and is now publicly criticizing Peter Navarro, a strong proponent of the tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined significantly, impacting stock holdings and 401(k)s, while numerous countries are seeking negotiated settlements with the U.S.</p>

            <p>Gold prices have decreased due to market instability resulting from the trade war between the U.S. and China, despite previously reaching an all-time high. Analysts attribute the price drop to short-term sell-offs by traders covering losses in other asset classes. Gold is still considered a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, and analysts expect the sell-off to be temporary. The tariff war has led to significant downturns in financial markets, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index experiencing a steep decline. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Economists are raising concerns that President Trump's recent tariffs could trigger a global recession.

The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs is causing market volatility and potentially damaging the global economy. While there are currently no signs of a recession, the long-term impact of the tariffs remains unclear, leading to concerns about reduced economic growth and higher inflation.</p>

            <p>Sarah Brown discusses the tragic loss of her daughter, Jennifer, and the subsequent establishment of the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory. The laboratory's Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort is studying the long-term effects of premature birth on brain development, following 400 children from birth to adulthood. The study aims to provide insights into how the body reacts to premature birth and the impact of maternal care, nutrition, and sleep. The research has also revealed the stark realities of the impact of poverty on brain development in premature babies.</p>

            <p>Ivica Zubac's dominant performance, with 24 points and 20 rebounds, propelled the Clippers to a victory over the San Antonio Spurs despite Kawhi Leonard's absence. The win moves the Clippers closer to securing a top-six seed in the Western Conference and avoiding the play-in tournament. The Clippers have won five straight games and 12 of their last 14, improving their position in the standings. Coach Tyronn Lue credited the team's improved play to a combination of factors, including Harden's increased level of play and the integration of new players.</p>

            <p>A survey suggests that over a third of secondary teachers have reported misogynistic behavior from students in the past week, and around 40% feel ill-equipped to address it. Teachers and parents are increasingly concerned about the misogynistic and violent content children are exposed to online. Some schools are taking a "zero tolerance" approach to derogatory language and providing guidance to parents on recognizing harmful online content. A study found that teenage girls are significantly less likely to feel safe in school than their male peers since the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

            <p>The article argues that Britain can no longer rely on the U.S. as a dependable ally under President Trump, citing his transactional approach to international relations and disregard for democratic norms. It suggests that Britain should seek new alliances with countries that share a commitment to democracy and multilateralism. The author emphasizes the need to avoid a "comforting delusion" that Trump's America is the same country as before, urging a more realistic assessment of the current situation and a diversification of Britain's foreign policy partnerships.</p>
