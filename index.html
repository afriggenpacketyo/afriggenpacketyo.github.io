            <p>Former President Barack Obama issued a statement supporting Harvard University's decision to reject demands from the Trump administration, which had threatened to freeze funding due to alleged inaction on antisemitism. Obama, a Harvard Law School alumnus, praised the university for standing up for academic freedom and resisting intimidation. He also expressed concern over the White House's moves against universities, urging them to uphold their values and resist intimidation tactics, even if it meant sacrificing financial resources. Trump had called for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status after the university refused to comply with the administration's demands. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump escalated his conflict with Harvard University by threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status after his administration froze over $2 billion in federal funding. The White House demands that Harvard make changes to its hiring, admissions, and teaching practices to combat antisemitism on campus. Harvard President Alan Garber rejected these demands, citing concerns over governmental regulation of the university's intellectual environment and academic freedom. A Harvard professor described the administration's actions as vengeful and groundless, aimed at silencing free speech. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Several states are pushing for work requirements for Medicaid recipients, arguing that it would encourage enrollees to find employment; however, most Medicaid programs offer limited support to help people find jobs. While success stories exist, such as individuals finding stable employment through health plan assistance, these instances are rare. Opponents argue that most Medicaid recipients are already employed or unable to work due to various reasons, suggesting that work requirements would primarily lead to coverage loss rather than improved economic prospects. Efforts to assist Medicaid recipients in securing employment have yielded limited results, as many enrollees already hold jobs without employer-sponsored health benefits.</p>

            <p>Treasury yields experienced a period of stability after a volatile week in the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped slightly to 4.343%, while the 2-year Treasury yield also saw a minor decrease. The previous week saw a significant surge in the 10-year Treasury yield, fueled by factors such as President Trump's tariff policies and concerns over debt. Analysts suggest that potential selling of Treasuries by foreign creditors like China, along with hedge fund activity, may have contributed to the recent volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

He believes that Trump's actions are a strategic blunder that will cost the United States dearly if the tariff policy is not reversed.

            <p>A watchdog group, Protect Democracy, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for removing a public tracker of government spending. The lawsuit argues that federal law requires the OMB to publicly post apportionment documents to prevent abuses of power and strengthen oversight. The OMB director claims the tracker disclosed sensitive information, but the Government Accountability Office has challenged this rationale. Congressional Democrats have also raised concerns about the removal of the tracker, arguing it hinders transparency and accountability.</p>

            <p>Republicans across the country are now advocating for soda bans in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), marking a significant shift from their previous defense of soda consumption. Politicians in several states are seeking to prevent people from buying soda with food stamps, citing concerns about health and nutrition. This move combines the focus on America's diet problems with the conservative desire to reform the welfare state. While Democrats largely oppose these bans, some experts argue that pilot programs are needed to test the effects and identify potential unintended consequences.</p>

            <p>Despite abortion bans in some US states, access is evolving as women find ways to obtain abortion pills through mail from organizations in states where it remains legal. This allows women to bypass state laws, highlighting the challenges in enforcing complete abortion bans.  The accessibility and affordability of these services, costing as little as $5, raise questions about the legality and safety of such practices. The narrative focuses on a hypothetical woman in rural Texas, illustrating the increasing availability of abortion options despite legal restrictions.</p>
