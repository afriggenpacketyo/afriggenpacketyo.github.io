          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed a major $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of advanced semiconductors. The deal, which runs until 2033, is centered on producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips at Samsung's new facility in Texas. Musk emphasized the strategic importance of this partnership, suggesting he will personally oversee efforts to maximize manufacturing efficiency and that the deal's value could ultimately exceed the initial figure. This agreement highlights the critical role of custom silicon in advancing Tesla's artificial intelligence and autonomous driving capabilities.</p>

          <p>Despite the England women's national football team's historic Euro 2025 victory, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a celebratory bank holiday. While a homecoming parade is scheduled for Tuesday in London, the government appears to be following the precedent set after the team's 2022 win. The decision is likely influenced by the significant economic cost of an extra public holiday, estimated to be over £1 billion. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had previously supported the idea, will host a special reception for the team.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has made shocking allegations, claiming he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies over two decades. In a police complaint, he described finding numerous corpses, many of them women and girls showing signs of sexual assault and violence. The Karnataka government has now formed a Special Investigation Team to probe the claims of murder and a cover-up by temple authorities. The case has prompted families of missing persons to demand their cases be reopened.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the renowned 1,500-year-old Shaolin Temple in China, is under criminal investigation for multiple serious allegations. The probe covers claims of embezzlement, having improper relationships with multiple women, and fathering illegitimate children. Known as the "CEO monk" for commercializing the temple, Shi has been stripped of his ordination certificate by China's Buddhist association, which stated his actions have severely damaged the reputation of Buddhism. This is not the first time he has faced such accusations, having been cleared of similar charges in 2015.</p>

The rise is also fueled by anxieties over immigration and a record influx of tourists, some of whom are perceived as disrespectful.

          <p>A sharp division has emerged within the House Republican conference over a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson has labeled the discharge petition, co-sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie, as "reckless," claiming it lacks protections for victims. Massie and his Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Ro Khanna, fired back, stating their bill was carefully crafted to redact victims' names. Massie warned that blocking the vote could become a political liability for the GOP, potentially costing them their majority in the midterms.</p>

          <p>Tyler Boebert, the 20-year-old son of U.S. Representative Lauren Boebert, has received a misdemeanor citation for child abuse related to an incident involving his own young son. According to the court summons, the charge is for "criminal negligence," though no death or injury occurred. In a statement, Rep. Boebert explained the event stemmed from a "miscommunication on monitoring" her grandson, who got out of the house. This follows previous legal troubles for Tyler, who was arrested on felony theft charges in February 2024, to which he later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.</p>

The agreement avoids a threatened 30% tariff but is still seen by many as a painful concession to the U.S. This article captures the mixed sentiment across Europe, where relief at avoiding a trade war is tempered by the costs of the deal.

Real estate agents report that a majority of current buyers are from the U.S., with political volatility cited as a key driver. While the programs are a vital source of revenue for the islands, they face scrutiny from the EU and U.S. over security concerns.</p>

          <p>Google has admitted that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to perform as expected during the catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Turkey in 2023. The system could have sent a "Take Action" alert, providing up to 35 seconds of warning, to 10 million people near the epicenter. Instead, it underestimated the quake's severity and sent the highest-level warning to only 469 phones. The failure highlights the limitations of the technology, which many countries rely on as a supplementary or primary warning system for one of the world's most devastating natural disasters.</p>
