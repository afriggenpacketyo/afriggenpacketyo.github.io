            <h2>Putin Announces Temporary Easter Truce in Ukraine Amid Ongoing Conflict</h2>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, ceasing military action from Saturday evening to midnight on Easter Sunday, assuming Ukraine would reciprocate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed the proposal as a manipulative tactic, highlighting ongoing Russian attacks. The proposed truce occurs amidst U.S.-led talks in Paris aimed at resolving the conflict, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing the urgency of achieving tangible results. Despite a previous ceasefire agreement intended to halt strikes on energy infrastructure, both sides have repeatedly accused each other of violations.</p>

            <p>Criminals dressed as soldiers opened fire at a cockfight in Ecuador, killing 12 and wounding several others, prompting police to detain four suspects believed to be part of the "Los R7" gang. The attack occurred in La Valencia, with security footage showing gunmen using automatic rifles on spectators. Ecuador is grappling with violence from around 20 criminal gangs involved in trafficking, kidnapping, and extortion, exacerbated by transnational cartels using its ports for drug shipments. President Daniel Noboa has renewed the state of emergency across large parts of the country, suggesting potential U.S. special forces deployment and legal reforms to combat drug violence.</p>

            <p>A judge has ruled that a former roommate of the slain University of Idaho students can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows" around the time of the murders. Bryan Kohberger, charged with the stabbing deaths of four students, had his defense attorneys argue against the testimony, citing its unreliability. The judge, however, determined that the testimony could be used, allowing for cross-examination. Additionally, the judge ruled that Kohberger's defense team cannot use his medical diagnoses to explain his courtroom demeanor unless he testifies.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants without due process, signaling a potential shift in the Court's tolerance of the administration's efforts to evade judicial review. The order came after the ACLU filed an emergency application alleging the government was moving Venezuelan immigrants to a detention facility in Texas and preparing them for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act without adequate notice or opportunity to challenge their removal. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, but the order suggests the Court may be less willing to tolerate procedural maneuvers intended to circumvent meaningful judicial review.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has dropped to the lowest point of his presidency, fueled by widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals a disappearance of the economic optimism that followed Trump's reelection, with more Americans believing the economy will worsen. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become increasingly negative about his economic policies. Tariffs, inflation, and government spending are key areas of concern, with a majority of Americans believing a recession is imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court's order directs the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that immigration authorities were attempting to restart removals under the act without providing due process. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order, and the administration is expected to seek a reversal of the temporary block.</p>

            <p>Scientists are claiming to have discovered a new color, called "olo," a saturated shade of blue-green, that cannot be seen by the naked eye without specific stimulation. The findings, published in Science Advances, involved stimulating specific cells in the retina with lasers. While some experts remain skeptical, describing the perceived color as a matter of interpretation, the researchers believe the findings could potentially aid research into color blindness. The experiment involved shining a laser beam into the pupil of one eye of each participant, stimulating only M cones, which sends a color signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision.</p>
