          <p>President Trump is considering reallocating $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the United States. This action follows Trump's earlier moves to block Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze federal funding, alleging insufficient action against anti-semitism on campus. Harvard has filed lawsuits in response to these actions, claiming they are unlawful and retaliatory, infringing on academic independence. The White House defended Trump's actions, criticizing judges who blocked the administration's policies, asserting the President's authority over immigration and national security policy.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates that the "true rate" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, significantly higher than the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate of 4.2%. LISEP's measure includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time work but unable to find it, and individuals in poverty-wage jobs. The report argues that the official unemployment rate presents an incomplete picture by not accounting for people who lack steady work and living wages. The analysis also reveals disparities among racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers facing higher rates of functional unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision for a world where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their own spheres of influence. This concept echoes 19th-century imperial rule, with Trump expressing interest in expanding American influence in the Western Hemisphere. While some analysts caution against attributing strategic intent to Trump's actions, his approach to Ukraine and his relationships with Presidents Putin and Xi indicate a shift towards a multipolar world order. However, attempts to establish spheres of influence face resistance, as seen in Canada and Greenland.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest several strategies to escape the payday loan debt cycle, including negotiating with lenders, seeking professional help from credit counseling agencies, and stopping the use of high-interest loans. Alternatives include personal loans from banks, reduced interest rates on credit cards, and assistance from family members. Building an emergency buffer through side gigs and exploring debt consolidation options are also recommended. A debt management plan (DMP) through a nonprofit counseling agency can consolidate debts and reduce interest rates, though it may temporarily lower credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent call to wind down the war in Gaza reflects Israel's increasing isolation from its allies. For months, Israel has faced criticism from foreign leaders and aid groups, but now even its closest allies, including the United States, Britain, and France, are expressing overt pressure. This shift is evident in Trump's comments, as well as Germany's strong criticism of Israel's actions and coordinated efforts by Britain, Canada, and France to condemn Israel's expansion in Gaza. These actions suggest a growing impatience with Prime Minister Netanyahu's handling of the conflict.</p>

Europe is the most affected continent, followed by North America and Asia, with plants causing the most economic damage.
