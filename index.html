            <p>The IRS is reportedly considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status following demands from the Trump administration regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Harvard has refused to comply with demands to end DEI programs and adopt merit-based admissions, leading to a White House freeze on grants and a Homeland Security threat to revoke student visa privileges. Harvard argues that revoking its tax-exempt status would be unlawful and harm its educational mission, impacting financial aid and research. The White House claims any IRS investigation began before Trump's public statements on the matter.</p>

The Liquor Control Board of Ontario briefly halted purchases of U.S. products, reflecting a broader sentiment of eroding trust in the U.S. as a reliable trading partner.</p>

The judge cited concerns that DOGE's broad access to data violated privacy laws and questioned the necessity of unfettered access to SSA's entire data systems. The ruling prevents DOGE staffers from accessing databases containing personally identifiable information and directs them to delete any non-anonymized data.

            <p>A common dolphin calf was killed by bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay, Wales, an event described as rare by cetacean experts. The attack, witnessed by passengers on a dolphin spotting trip, involved four bottlenose dolphins throwing the calf out of the water. Experts suggest that increasing numbers of common dolphins in the area due to climate change may be leading to more interactions with resident bottlenose dolphins. The incident has been described as distressing for those who witnessed it.</p>

            <p>Grover Norquist, a long-time anti-tax activist, is expressing disbelief over the possibility of Republicans considering tax hikes on the wealthy. He argues that such a move would be economically destructive and politically foolish. This shift in the GOP is driven by factors like the shifting base of the Republican Party and the need to address the cost of extending Trump's tax cuts. Some Republicans are open to raising taxes on top earners to offset costs, a move that Norquist opposes.</p>

The suspect, Phoenix Ikner, is the son of a local sheriff's deputy and had access to his mother's gun.

            <p>A Japanese bus driver with 29 years of service lost his retirement package worth $84,000 after being fired for stealing $7 from passengers' fares. The driver was caught on camera pocketing 1,000 yen ($7) in 2022. He sued the city after being denied his retirement money, but the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in the city's favor. The court stated that the man's conduct could undermine public trust in the system. The driver had been reprimanded several times during his career for other incidents.</p>
