          <h2>Trump States Attorney General Should Release Credible Epstein Information</h2>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information on Jeffrey Epstein that she deems credible. This comment comes as the administration faces pressure from some of its own supporters and political allies, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, who are calling for greater transparency regarding the Epstein case. The pushback follows the Justice Department's recent conclusion that it found no evidence of a so-called "client list." The situation highlights a rare division between Trump and segments of his base over the handling of the controversial files.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president of Nigeria who died at age 82, was buried in his hometown of Daura. Thousands of mourners, including current President Bola Tinubu, attended the service for the two-time leader. Buhari's presidency, from 2015 to 2023, followed an earlier stint as a military dictator in the 1980s. His legacy is viewed as complex, marked by efforts to combat corruption but also characterized by economic challenges, escalating insecurity, and concerns over human rights abuses during his time in power.</p>

          <p>A decades-old public health practice is facing renewed debate as several states, including Arkansas, consider legislation to ban or remove fluoride from drinking water. Critics, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raise concerns about potential health risks, citing a National Institutes of Health report that found a possible link between high fluoride levels and lower IQs in children. However, the American Dental Association and the CDC continue to endorse fluoridation as a safe and effective public health achievement for preventing tooth decay, highlighting a significant clash over scientific guidance.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to officially complete the Badwater 135, a grueling 135-mile ultramarathon through Death Valley. He finished the race, known as one of the world's toughest, in under the 48-hour official time limit, a goal he had failed to meet three years prior. Becker, who only began running in his late 50s, endured temperatures around 118 degrees Fahrenheit with the help of his dedicated support crew. His achievement serves as an inspiring example of endurance and determination at any age.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, some migrant workers are using mobile apps like Coqui to track the real-time locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. These apps allow users to report and view sightings of ICE activity, helping them avoid potential arrest and deportation, even if they have legal status. While users say the technology alleviates fear and allows them to work, ICE officials have expressed concern that such apps could endanger their officers. The development highlights the growing use of technology as a tool for navigating contentious immigration policies.</p>

Bolsonaro, who has consistently claimed the charges are a "witch hunt," could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted.

The review also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients.

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade deal with Indonesia, averting a planned 32% tariff on its goods in exchange for greater market access for American firms. Under the new agreement, the U.S. will impose a lower 19% tariff, while Indonesia will reportedly lower its own trade barriers for U.S. products. As part of the deal, Trump stated that Indonesia has also agreed to purchase billions of dollars worth of American energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest in a series of negotiations following a broad tariff threat issued by the White House.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for treason, South Korea's courts will retry Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim's family successfully argued for the retrial, claiming his 1979 military court conviction was unjust and involved torture. The case re-examines whether Kim was a traitor seeking power or a patriot who killed a dictator to prevent further bloodshed and restore democracy. This historic retrial forces a national reckoning with a pivotal moment in the country's turbulent path from dictatorship to democracy, a debate that remains deeply polarizing today.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, claiming he misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff vehemently denied the accusation, calling it a baseless and false attempt at political retaliation from a long-time adversary. A spokesperson for Schiff clarified that he has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and Maryland and followed all laws and counsel advice. Schiff suggested the attack was an attempt by Trump to distract from the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation files.</p>

          <p>Recent actions from the Trump administration suggest a significant shift in its approach to the war in Ukraine, moving towards a more aggressive stance against Russia. President Trump stated that Ukraine "shouldn't" target Moscow, following reports that he had asked President Zelenskyy if it were possible. The U.S. also announced plans to provide Ukraine with more Patriot missile systems and has threatened Russia with severe tariffs if a truce is not reached. This contrasts with a previously more cautious approach and comes as the European Union struggles to approve its own new sanctions package against Moscow.</p>

The posts, which also referenced political figures, were quickly removed, and the account has since been secured.

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six federal charges for the targeted attacks that killed former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and injured state Senator John Hoffman and his wife. The charges include stalking and murder, with prosecutors noting this is the first step toward potentially seeking the death penalty. Authorities also revealed a letter Boelter allegedly wrote after the attacks, in which he made bizarre claims about being a secret military operative. The indictment moves the case to the federal level to address what prosecutors called an unprecedented act of political violence in the state.</p>

          <p>Pressure is mounting from within the Republican party for the Trump administration to provide more transparency on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. House Speaker Mike Johnson urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to explain her handling of the files and her past comments about a "client list." Other prominent Republicans, including Rep. Tim Burchett and Sen. Josh Hawley, have echoed these calls, with some demanding that Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell testify before Congress. This growing internal dissent reflects frustration among the MAGA base following the Justice Department's report that it found no evidence of a client list.</p>

One of the stalled bills was the GENIUS Act, which aimed to regulate stablecoins and had previously passed the Senate with bipartisan support.

Judge Sean Jordan sided with credit union plaintiffs, ruling that the CFPB had exceeded its authority.

This growing body of research explores various paths for integrating the island, reflecting a strategic shift to prepare for future scenarios.

Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the company projects the initiative will generate $75 billion in economic value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration is systematically weakening the nation's ability to handle disasters, with FEMA's recent struggles during Texas floods serving as a key example. The author points to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's conflicting statements about eliminating or redeploying the agency as evidence of incoherent leadership. The piece contends that beyond rhetoric, the administration is undermining disaster preparedness by cutting climate research, canceling infrastructure grant programs, and gutting forecasting agencies like NOAA. This creates a dangerous situation where communities are left more vulnerable to increasingly extreme weather events.</p>
