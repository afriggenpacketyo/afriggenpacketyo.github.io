          <p>Conan O'Brien and Ryan Reynolds humorously commented on Meghan Markle's new lifestyle brand, As Ever, particularly her artisanal jams. The conversation began with Reynolds discussing his father's career as a food broker, leading to jokes about Markle's luxury jams being similar to his father's work. The comedians' ribbing follows criticism of Markle's brand as inauthentic, with some experts noting that her approach lacks the relatability or aspiration that made Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray successful. The article underscores the importance of authenticity and connection in marketing, suggesting that Markle needs to establish a genuine connection with her audience to achieve success in the lifestyle industry.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan, highlighting how it distracts India from its aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power. Despite India's military capabilities, achieving a decisive victory against Pakistan is nearly impossible due to nuclear arsenals and proxy warfare. The article emphasizes the increasing involvement of global powers, with the United States supporting India and China backing Pakistan, further complicating the situation. India's Hindu-nationalist government faces pressure to respond aggressively to terrorist attacks, making restraint difficult, while Pakistan's army continues to exert influence over the country's politics. The article concludes that India must find a way to coexist with its neighbor to progress as a global power. </p>

          <p>This article explores the life and legacy of Malcolm X, focusing on his advocacy for Black self-confidence and resistance against oppression. Born into poverty and violence, Malcolm X's early experiences with racism shaped his worldview. He became a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam, denouncing "white devils" and advocating for Black separatism. Later in life, after a pilgrimage to Mecca, he shifted away from racist doctrines and sought to unite oppressed people of color. The article highlights his criticism of Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent approach and his declaration that he saw an "American nightmare" rather than an "American dream." Malcolm X's legacy continues to resonate through hip-hop and cultural identity.</p>

          <p>Kenton Cool, a British mountain guide, has broken his own record by scaling Mount Everest for the 19th time, marking the most ascents by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool's climbing career on Everest began in 2004, with only interruptions in 2014 due to an avalanche and in 2015 due to an earthquake, as well as in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The article notes that hundreds of climbers and guides are currently on the mountain during the spring climbing season, aiming to reach the summit before the monsoon season begins. Only Nepali Sherpa guides have surpassed Cool's record, with Kami Rita holding the highest number of climbs at 30.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that altering the way bricks are stacked in kilns in Bangladesh could significantly reduce air pollution. The traditional method of stacking bricks tightly restricts airflow, leading to inefficient burning and increased emissions. By implementing a zig-zag pattern, airflow increases, leading to more efficient combustion and reduced fuel consumption. The study found that this simple intervention could decrease fuel use by 23% and reduce carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by about 20%, improving both worker conditions and profits for kiln owners. The research team is now working with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training, offering a hopeful solution for a region plagued by severe air pollution.</p>

          <p>This article examines the struggles of small, religiously affiliated colleges in rural areas, which are increasingly facing declining enrollment and financial challenges. Many of these institutions are attempting mergers to survive, as combining resources and streamlining administrations offers a potential solution to financial instability. These colleges often serve low-income, first-generation students who appreciate the personal touch and religious values they offer. The article also notes that some religious colleges are experiencing enrollment gains due to growing political divisions and ideological attacks on secular institutions, with parents seeking a safe place for their children with a biblical worldview. The article also explores how a long decline in the proportion of adults who consider themselves affiliated with a religion appears to have leveled off, the Pew Research Center finds.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a pivotal presidential election that will determine the country's stance on key issues such as abortion rights, LGBTQ protections, and its relationship with the European Union. The front-runners are RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, a pro-EU candidate, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative supported by the Law and Justice party. Polls suggest a likely runoff between the two, with Trzaskowski leading. The election takes place amid heightened security concerns due to the war in Ukraine and worries about U.S. commitment to European security. A win for Trzaskowski could ease political gridlock, while a Nawrocki presidency might stall the coalition's agenda.</p>

The incident prompted a temporary closure of the bridge and an investigation into the cause of the crash. The ship, which had been on a goodwill tour, was en route to Iceland after departing from Pier 17 in Manhattan.

The review also covers Sergei Loznitsaâ€™s "Two Prosecutors" and Oliver Laxeâ€™s "SirÃ¢t," highlighting their bleak outlooks.

          <p>A recent internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor right-wing extremist attitudes. While the study offers some relief, it also reveals that a small percentage of soldiers hold chauvinist or xenophobic views. Some researchers are skeptical of the safeguards in place, noting that the survey is voluntary and that the ZMSBw is part of the Bundeswehr itself. Concerns remain about the potential for extremist attitudes to persist, especially with the government's push to increase recruitment and the normalization of right-wing attitudes in wider society.</p>

The author criticizes America's focus on unproven, niche projects over tried-and-tested transit systems. The piece argues that revitalized railways offer an alternative way forward, promoting community, connection, and a shared purpose, advocating for a shift away from car-centric culture.</p>

          <p>Poles are participating in a presidential election against a backdrop of heightened security concerns due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S. commitment to European security. The election pits Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski against Karol Nawrocki, with polls indicating a likely runoff. The election is seen as a test of strength for other political forces, including the far right. The presidency holds significant power, including serving as commander of the armed forces and having veto power over legislation, making the outcome crucial for Poland's political future.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis crime sceneâ€”bloody, bare footprintsâ€”led to a decades-long search for answers and ultimately the arrest of Jerry Westrom in 2019. The victim, Jeanie Childs, was found stabbed to death in her apartment. Investigators initially considered Arthur Gray, with whom Childs lived, but he had an alibi. Years later, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that kept repeating itself, leading investigators to Westrom. Despite Westrom's denial, his DNA matched evidence at the scene, and forensic analysis confirmed that a footprint belonged to him, resulting in his conviction.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, offering long-term operating rights to Chinese companies in exchange for construction financing. This model represents a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Projects like Nairobiâ€™s mega-highway and Zambiaâ€™s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting this approach. In Kenya, Chinese financiers may contribute 40% of the funds for a railway extension, gaining exclusive rights to construct and operate it for 25 years to recoup their investment through toll fees.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a presidential runoff election after the previous election in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities in financing and organization. The initial election saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly come out on top. Alleged electoral violations included the activation of thousands of fake social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messages as part of a "Russian hybrid attack." Georgescu was subsequently banned from standing in the rerun, and public prosecutors opened an investigation into him.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and impose a monthly fee on current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" to address a $12 billion budget deficit. The changes are attributed to budget deficits caused by Trump's tariffs, increased medication costs, and higher healthcare usage among older adults. While the governor claims no one will be removed from Medi-Cal, the proposed measures aim to save $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year. The plan requires approval from state legislators before taking effect.</p>

          <p>China has announced anti-dumping duties on imports of POM copolymers from the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan, with rates as high as 74.9%. The decision follows an investigation launched in May 2024, after the U.S. sharply increased tariffs on Chinese goods. POM copolymers are used in various applications, including auto parts, electronics, and medical equipment. The highest duties are levied on imports from the United States, while lower rates apply to imports from Taiwan and Japan.
