          <h2>Trump Comments on Potential Release of Epstein Grand Jury Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:56:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has publicly addressed the potential court-approved release of grand jury transcripts related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In a social media post, he suggested that unsealing the documents would not placate his critics, whom he labeled "troublemakers and radical left lunatics." This statement follows his own request to the Justice Department to release the pertinent testimony, a move made amid increasing pressure for transparency on the matter. Trump's comments indicate he may not take further action, framing the demands as an insatiable political attack.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company Neuralink was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing, a designation meant for firms owned by economically and socially disadvantaged individuals to gain preferential access to government contracts. The filing occurred shortly before a funding round valued the brain-computer interface company at $9 billion. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box on the form was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, asserting the company never sought or received federal benefits. The incident drew scrutiny as Musk, the world's wealthiest person, has been critical of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p>

          <h2>US Reportedly Revokes Visas for Eight Brazilian Supreme Court Judges Amid Bolsonaro Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an escalation of tensions, the U.S. government, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has reportedly revoked the visas of eight Brazilian supreme court judges. This action is viewed as part of a campaign to support former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who faces trial for an alleged coup attempt. The move follows President Trump's announcement of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which he linked to the supposed persecution of his ally. The visa revocations have been condemned by Brazilian officials as an affront to their nation's sovereignty while also causing a domestic backlash against Bolsonaro.</p>

          <p>A government investigation into the May 2024 building collapse in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers, has concluded the tragedy was "entirely preventable." Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson revealed the report found multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and ignoring structural cracks. Serious safety concerns were reportedly raised long before the incident, with one safety officer resigning in protest while work continued. The government is now calling for criminal accountability as a police investigation continues, while survivors and victims' families deal with ongoing trauma and financial hardship.</p>

The groundbreaking ceremony took place in the city of Nyingchi for the project first outlined in China's 2020 five-year plan. The dam has raised concerns in neighboring India, as the Yarlung Tsangpo is the upstream source of the Brahmaputra River, a vital water source for India's northeastern states.

          <p>More than 100 days after their implementation, President Trump's widespread tariffs are being analyzed by economists for their actual effects on the U.S. economy. While the policies have generated significant tariff-related tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new domestic investments, their long-term benefits remain uncertain. Analysts caution that corporate commitments could be reversed due to policy fluctuations and that the tariffs have begun to increase consumer prices on certain imported goods. Despite initial fears of a recession, the economy has remained resilient, but new tariff announcements add unpredictability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An attempt by President Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would likely trigger an unprecedented and complex legal battle with significant economic and market ramifications.

The conflict, fueled by Trump's demands for lower interest rates, creates profound uncertainty and threatens the central bank's long-standing independence.

          <p>A recent article explores the cultural resurgence of tanning, connecting it to a broader anti-establishment ideology promoted by figures within the Trump administration, like Health Secretary Robert F.

Influencers and some wellness advocates are promoting unproven theories, such as sunscreen causing cancer, which aligns with a political movement skeptical of mainstream science.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the changes will make the agency more efficient, while critics, including Democratic lawmakers and union leaders, argue the decision will "devastate public health" by gutting the scientific foundation for environmental protection.

          <p>Steel giant ArcelorMittal has paused its decarbonization plans for its German facilities, handing back a €1.3 billion government subsidy and casting doubt on Germany's green steel ambitions. The company cited slower-than-expected progress in the energy transition, noting that green hydrogen is not yet viable and natural gas is not competitive as an interim solution. This move highlights the immense challenges facing the industry, including the high cost and unreliable supply of green hydrogen and intense competition from cheaper, conventionally produced steel. While other German steelmakers remain committed, the pullout underscores the economic risks of the green transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claims That Sunscreen Increases Skin Cancer Risk</h2>

          <p>A DW fact check addresses and refutes social media claims that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion; in fact, UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The article explores reasons for the myth's persistence, including the rising number of diagnosed cases due to better awareness and detection. It also notes that while sunscreen sales are increasing, many people use it inconsistently or only on vacation, and older studies may have used less effective products.</p>

          <p>Weeks after deadly flash floods swept through Texas Hill Country over the Fourth of July weekend, the search for victims is ongoing, with about 100 people still reported missing. The floods killed at least 135 people, including 27 campers and counselors from a single youth camp on the Guadalupe River. In response to the tragedy, the Texas Legislature is convening a special session to review the authorities' handling of the disaster. Lawmakers will also consider measures to improve early warning systems, as the hard-hit Kerr County currently lacks a comprehensive alert system despite its natural proneness to flash flooding.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a payment processing company whose stock has fallen significantly. The move follows Global Payments' poorly received acquisition of Worldpay, a deal that investors criticized for its high price and questionable strategic fit. Elliott's involvement is seen as a potential catalyst for change, as the firm could push for a reconstituted board to enhance oversight, restore investor confidence, and ensure accountability during the integration of the large acquisition. This intervention aims to help the company execute its new strategy more effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a large parliamentary majority, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's authority is being questioned following his decision to expel a small group of dissenting backbench MPs. This disciplinary action, intended to enforce party unity, has instead highlighted the challenges his government faces in controlling its own members and navigating external pressures. Whitehall insiders describe a government that sometimes feels chaotic and lacks a clear implementation plan for its agenda. Furthermore, the administration is heavily constrained by financial markets, with the need to maintain fiscal credibility limiting its policy options and creating tension within the Labour party.</p>

However, the team's performance faltered in the final half-hour, allowing the Wallabies to score two late tries and narrow the margin significantly.

The reopening of Camp Camp, which serves over 800 campers annually, has been described as a testament to community spirit in the midst of widespread tragedy.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed a lump in her groin was a pulled muscle from working out received a shocking diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. Unusually, her cancer did not present with a typical skin mole, making the initial discovery difficult. She underwent an aggressive treatment protocol combining radiation with two immunotherapy drugs, which caused severe side effects but has led to what her doctor calls a "miraculous" improvement. After 18 months of treatment, her cancer has not progressed, and she is now mentoring other patients.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has proposed creating city-owned grocery stores to lower food costs, but the plan faces significant challenges. An article questions the feasibility, pointing out that Mamdani's other policy goals, such as a $30 minimum wage and expanded worker benefits, would likely drive up operating costs, conflicting with the aim of selling cheaper groceries. The analysis suggests that to achieve low prices, a public grocery system would need to prioritize cost-cutting over other progressive values like environmental sustainability and union labor. The candidate has not yet clarified how he would resolve these trade-offs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has taken a significant step toward regulating cryptocurrencies with President Trump signing the "Genius Act" into law, which sets new rules for stablecoins. Passed with bipartisan support, the law mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain full reserves and adhere to anti-money laundering standards. This marks a major victory for the crypto industry, which has lobbied heavily for a clearer regulatory framework. However, critics argue the new rules are too weak and fear that another proposed bill, the CLARITY Act, would shift oversight to a less stringent regulator, potentially exposing consumers to greater risk.
