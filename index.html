          <p>President Trump announced his intention to soon establish a "majority" of his nominees on the Federal Reserve board, aiming to reduce interest rates. This declaration follows his unprecedented move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee of former President Biden, citing allegations about her mortgages. Trump also criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for high interest rates, particularly impacting the housing market, and has selected Stephen Miran as a replacement for another retiring governor. This article highlights the president's direct efforts to reshape the central bank's monetary policy direction.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is challenging President Trump's order for her removal, with her lawyer stating the president lacks authority for such an action. Trump cited unproven allegations of false statements on her mortgage as cause, an accusation Cook denies. The Federal Reserve emphasized the importance of governors' long, fixed terms and removal protections for maintaining monetary policy independence. This unprecedented legal battle raises concerns among investors about the central bank's credibility and potential impacts on US borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>The 2026 midterm elections are shaping up with critical Senate contests, as Democrats aim to gain control of the chamber while Republicans defend a larger number of seats. Key battlegrounds include North Carolina, where former Governor Roy Cooper is challenging RNC Chairman Michael Whatley for an open seat, and Georgia, where Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff faces a crowded GOP primary. Other states like New Hampshire, Michigan, Maine, Texas, Ohio, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska also feature competitive races or open seats, with both parties vying for strategic advantages and facing internal primary challenges.</p>

Mr. Hewitt's family expressed being "absolutely broken" by the loss of the "most wonderful, intelligent, kind man."

          <p>Following President Trump's order to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, financial markets showed a split reaction: short-term Treasury yields declined, while long-term yields increased. This indicates investor bets on lower interest rates in the near future but higher rates over the long term, possibly due to concerns about the Fed's independence and future inflation. Cook's attorney has vowed a lawsuit, asserting Trump's lack of authority for the removal. Economists suggest Trump's actions are effectively usurping the Fed's forward guidance, leading to market volatility and a decline in the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempted removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has escalated concerns about the central bank's independence and its potential impact on the US economy. While presidential disputes with the Fed are not new, Trump's aim to reshape the entire board with politically aligned appointees is seen as unprecedented. Economists warn that political interference in monetary policy could lead to inflation, market instability, and increased borrowing costs for the US government, potentially undermining global investor confidence in the Fed's credibility.

          <p>Spanish Civil Guard authorities have dismantled an illegal animal trafficking ring, discovering over 150 exotic animals, including endangered species, at an unauthorized pet store in Nules, Valencia.

The seized animals, with an estimated market value of nearly $81,500, included ring-tailed lemurs, a Bali starling, and Asian otters, some of which are highly protected internationally.

          <p>This article analyzes the potential movement of gold prices in September, noting the metal's significant surge since early 2024 but recent decline from record highs. The price of gold is influenced by inflation and interest rates; a decline in August inflation could lead to a drop in gold prices due to reduced demand for alternative assets. Conversely, an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut in September could cause gold prices to rise, as lower rates typically increase demand. Investors are advised to consider dollar-cost averaging or fractional investments to hedge against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, has threatened to withhold millions in federal funding from California, Washington, and New Mexico for failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers.

Duffy emphasized safety, arguing truckers need English proficiency for road signs and communication with law enforcement.

A haboob is a dust storm caused by outflowing winds from an incoming thunderstorm over dry, dusty regions. The downdrafts from cumulonimbus clouds kick up dust and debris, creating a wall of dust that rapidly reduces visibility. The National Weather Service advises extreme caution for drivers, recommending pulling off the road and turning off all lights to avoid collisions.

          <p>Jake Haro, 32, and Rebecca Haro, 41, the parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, have been charged with murder with malice and making a false police report, 12 days after reporting their son missing. Authorities presume the infant is dead, citing inconsistencies in Rebecca Haro's initial statement about an alleged attack in a parking lot. Jake Haro has a prior child abuse conviction from 2023, and another 2-year-old child was removed from their home by child protective services. Search efforts for Emmanuel's remains are ongoing, with the couple maintaining their innocence.</p>

This success paves the way for global regulatory approval, offering a potential needle-free alternative in the lucrative GLP-1 market. The pill also significantly lowered hemoglobin A1C levels, with most patients no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. While some side effects like nausea and vomiting were noted, the drug's convenience and lack of dietary restrictions could expand access to obesity treatments.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $100,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account for savers looking to protect and grow their money. While CD rates are fixed and predictable, high-yield savings account rates are variable and can change. The analysis shows that for shorter terms (3 or 9 months), a high-yield savings account might earn slightly more, but for 6-month or 1-year terms, a CD often yields more, with the added benefit of guaranteed earnings. Savers are advised to consider their liquidity needs and potential early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks a significant development in the conflict, as Russia has previously claimed incursions into the area. While Moscow has not officially claimed Dnipropetrovsk, unlike other eastern regions, any Russian advance would be a blow to Ukrainian morale.

          <p>President Donald Trump is actively pursuing a strategy to undermine the Federal Reserve's autonomy, a departure from decades of precedent where presidents respected the central bank's independence. This article details Trump's methods, including relentless public criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the unprecedented attempt to fire Governor Lisa Cook over unconfirmed mortgage allegations. With several governor terms expiring, Trump aims to appoint allies to gain a majority on the rate-setting committee, effectively seeking to dictate monetary policy. This approach raises significant concerns about the long-term implications for the Fed's credibility and economic stability.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state Legislature to redraw its congressional map, ruling that the 2021 lines violated mandatory redistricting standards and requirements, specifically Proposition 4 which aimed to prohibit partisan gerrymandering. This decision could create an opportunity for Democrats to win a seat in the heavily Republican state, where all four congressional seats are currently held by Republicans. The ruling is part of a broader national trend of redistricting battles, with other states like Texas, California, and Indiana also grappling with efforts to reshape electoral maps for political advantage.</p>

He reportedly left Chelsea due to concerns about his pathway to the first team, despite being considered the best in his age group. This transfer highlights a shift in youth football dynamics, with Liverpool and Manchester United challenging Chelsea's long-standing academy dominance, driven partly by Brexit's impact on player recruitment.</p>
