          <p>A memo from a Justice Department and FBI review has concluded there is no evidence of a "client list" associated with deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein. The review, ordered by Trump-appointed leadership, also found no basis for investigating or charging any uncharged third parties connected to his crimes. Furthermore, officials released footage that they state corroborates the 2019 finding that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell, aiming to counter widespread conspiracy theories. The memo asserts that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the goal of combating child exploitation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that any country aligning with what he terms "Anti-American policies of BRICS" will face an additional 10% tariff without exceptions. This announcement came via Truth Social as leaders of the BRICS nations met in Brazil, where they criticized Trump's broader tariff strategies as a threat to the global economy. The BRICS bloc, which recently expanded, includes major economies like China, Russia, and India, and aims to increase the influence of Global South countries. This move escalates trade tensions and follows previous threats by Trump against the alliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has found Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three of her in-laws and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a beef Wellington dish containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The incident occurred during a family lunch in July 2023, leading to the deaths of her husband's parents and aunt, with his uncle being the sole survivor. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally poisoned the meal, while the defense claimed it was an accident, attributing her subsequent lies to investigators to panic. Patterson now faces a potential life sentence for the crimes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump sharply criticized Elon Musk, stating he was "saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely 'off the rails'" after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." The public falling out follows disagreements over a recent tax and spending bill, which ended EV tax credits, and marks a sour end to their previous alliance. Trump dismissed the idea of a third party as "ridiculous" and a source of "total disruption and chaos." Musk's move was a direct response to the spending bill he claimed would bankrupt the economy.</p>

          <p>Fertility rates across the United States and the world are plummeting to historic lows, driven by women having greater economic independence and choosing to have fewer or no children. While this reflects increased personal freedom, it presents significant long-term challenges, including workforce shortages and strains on social safety nets like Social Security. The U.S. fertility rate has fallen to 1.6, well below the 2.1 replacement level, leading to an aging population. This demographic shift is sparking debate over "pronatalist" policies aimed at encouraging higher birth rates, a topic that is becoming increasingly contentious.</p>

The visit is being framed as a "friendly gesture" aimed at maintaining positive bilateral relations between the two countries. The port was leased to a Chinese-owned company in 2015, a deal that has since drawn scrutiny over national security implications.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that the increasing financialization of housing across Europe is a primary driver of the continent's severe housing crisis, creating a "political timebomb." Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have poured trillions into residential real estate, treating homes as a lucrative asset class. This has driven up prices and rents, making homeownership unattainable for many and fueling support for far-right parties. The article contends that this system, which prioritizes profit over residency, has shifted power away from inhabitants and is failing to provide a fundamental human need. (not investment advice)</p>

The therapy, detailed in Nature Medicine, delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, correcting a mutation that prevents the transmission of sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants, ranging from children to adults, showed considerable hearing improvement after six months, with a seven-year-old regaining almost full hearing.

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Major Hurdles for Elon Musk's Proposed 'America Party'</h2>

          <p>Elon Musk's vow to create a new "America Party" faces significant legal and logistical challenges that make it a daunting endeavor, even for the world's wealthiest person. Election law experts note that establishing a new political party requires navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties. The process involves intensive efforts for ballot access, signature gathering, and likely costly litigation against challenges from Democrats and Republicans. Building a nationally recognized party is a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project, not a short-term political maneuver.</p>

          <p>The al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM has become one of Africa's most lethal militant organizations, driving a surge of jihadist violence across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017, the group has expanded its operations and exploits local grievances and a lack of economic opportunities to recruit young men. JNIM seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law and rejects the authority of Sahel governments. Military juntas that have seized power in the region have failed to contain the threat, with analysts suggesting their heavy-handed tactics have fueled further recruitment for the militants.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS group of emerging economies have called for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence. In a joint statement from their summit in Rio de Janeiro, they described AI as a "unique opportunity" for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair governance. The bloc emphasized the need for technical standards developed with public sector and UN involvement to ensure trust and security. The leaders also demanded equal access to AI technologies for all countries, particularly those in the Global South.</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and Egypt in Doha, have concluded their latest session without achieving a breakthrough. According to a Palestinian official, messages were exchanged but no significant progress was made in bridging the gaps between the two sides. Hamas is reportedly holding to its core demands, including a guaranteed end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated he instructed his negotiators to reach a deal but remains committed to eliminating Hamas, a key sticking point that has derailed previous efforts.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Containment has reached 30%, up from 10% a day earlier, thanks to favorable weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 firefighting personnel. The fire, which started Wednesday, is threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to several endangered species, and has prompted mandatory evacuations. Officials are hoping to make continued progress before a heat wave is expected to arrive midweek, which could create more challenging conditions.</p>

The ongoing violence provides a grim backdrop to the renewed diplomatic efforts to secure a deal for a truce and the release of hostages.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo amid their sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. Rizzo had been the team's general manager since 2009, building the roster that won the franchise's first championship. Owner Mark Lerner cited the team's poor on-field performance as the reason for the change, stating that a "fresh approach and new energy" is needed for the club to move forward.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, statutory leave is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people essential time away from work to grieve. The change, which has been championed by campaigners and MPs, is a significant step in acknowledging the profound impact of pregnancy loss before the 24-week mark for both parents.</p>
