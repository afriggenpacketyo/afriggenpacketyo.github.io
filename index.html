Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva immediately stated his country would respond with reciprocity, invoking a new law allowing for proportional countermeasures. President Trump also claimed an unfair trade relationship, though U.S. government data shows a trade surplus with Brazil, a fact da Silva highlighted in his response.</p>

          <p>Police in south Belfast will not assist in dismantling a large bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, despite safety concerns from the city council. The bonfire's proximity to a major electricity substation threatens power to two hospitals, and asbestos has been found at the site. However, police concluded that the risk of dismantling the structure was higher and less manageable than the risk of allowing the bonfire to proceed as planned.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the interim administrator of NASA. The appointment follows the president's withdrawal of his previous nominee, Jared Isaacman, citing Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX is a major NASA contractor. Duffy will temporarily lead the space agency as it pursues ambitious goals to return astronauts to the moon and eventually to Mars.</p>

          <p>Varda Space Industries, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company's mission is based on the premise that the microgravity of space allows for the creation of more perfect drug crystals, which is difficult to achieve on Earth. With three successful space launches already completed, Varda will use the new capital to increase its flight cadence and expand its in-space laboratory capabilities.</p>
