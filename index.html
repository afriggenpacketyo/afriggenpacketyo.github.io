        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump are not legally permissible, stating they exceed his authority under federal economic emergency laws. The decision, a significant challenge to Trump's trade strategy, does not immediately block the tariffs, giving the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling pertains to broad tariffs on numerous countries and specific duties on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs, a power it described as belonging to Congress.</p>

          <p>Florida has scheduled the September 30th execution of Victor Tony Jones, convicted of fatally stabbing a couple during a 1990 robbery. This would be the state's 13th scheduled execution of the year, extending a record number since the death penalty was restored in 1976. The state has executed more people this year than any other, surpassing its previous annual record of eight. The national total of executions is also on track to be the highest since 2014, reflecting a broader trend in the application of capital punishment in the U.S. Jones's legal team is expected to file appeals to block the execution.</p>

          <p>Charles Borges, the Chief Data Officer for the Social Security Administration, has resigned days after filing a whistleblower complaint. He alleged that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded the entire country's Social Security data to a "vulnerable cloud environment." The SSA has refuted the claim, stating the data was secure and not compromised. Borges cited retaliation and a hostile work environment as reasons for his departure, claiming his duties became impossible to perform ethically, a situation he described as a "constructive discharge." His resignation highlights internal turmoil over data management and security within the agency.</p>

          <p>China's stock markets are experiencing a significant rally, with the Shanghai Composite Index reaching a 10-year high, drawing renewed attention from both overseas and domestic investors. Asset managers are becoming more optimistic, citing that Chinese equities have substantial room for growth compared to other global markets trading at historical highs. Key drivers for this potential continued growth include domestic investors shifting from low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's strategic push for technological innovation. This shift marks a potential reversal after years of underperformance and foreign investor exodus from the region's markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Live-Fire Military Drills Linked to Hundreds of Wildfires Across the UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 20:55:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of wildfires across the UK since 2023 have been sparked by live-fire military training exercises, according to figures obtained by the BBC. Unexploded ordnance from both current and past drills, some dating back to World War II, often makes it too dangerous for fire crews to effectively combat the blazes. Of 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence land between January 2023 and July 2025, 385 were directly caused by army maneuvers. While the MoD states it has a robust policy to mitigate risks, some local residents are calling for a ban on live-fire training during the driest months due to health and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's actions were unlawful. The court found that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacks the authority to vacate a prior extension of TPS under the governing statute. This decision provides temporary relief for Venezuelans who have permission to live and work in the U.S. due to the ongoing crisis in their home country.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has described a potential plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago as an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been consulted on the matter and suggested President Trump's motives extend beyond crime reduction, possibly to influence future elections. The criticism follows reports that the Pentagon is drafting plans to deploy National Guard members to the city. The Trump administration has previously sent federal agents and military personnel to other cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., citing the need to address crime and illegal immigration, which has drawn significant opposition from local officials.</p>

Opponents, a coalition including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have booked over $10 million in ad time to fight the measure.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the cancellation of $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that was previously approved by Congress. President Trump utilized a little-known procedure called a "pocket rescission" to withhold funds for 15 international programs near the end of the fiscal year, effectively bypassing congressional oversight. The move has drawn strong criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who warn it could increase the likelihood of a federal government shutdown later in the year. Some moderate Republicans have also expressed opposition, with Senator Susan Collins calling the action a clear violation of the law, as Congress holds the constitutional power to allocate spending.</p>

One participant saw her attendance more than double, attributing her newfound confidence to the bond she formed with her toddler mentee.

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine indicates that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are often prescribed medication too soon after their diagnosis, contrary to clinical guidelines. The research, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that 42% of children aged 3 to 5 received a prescription within 30 days of being diagnosed. Experts recommend behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment for this age group due to potential side effects from stimulant medications like Ritalin. The findings raise questions about the appropriateness of early medication and whether non-pharmacological strategies are being sufficiently utilized before resorting to prescriptions.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom's office confirmed it would ensure Harris's safety, calling the move an act of "erratic, vindictive political impulses."

Trust remains a major obstacle following the public fallout, and any potential meeting is being kept private by both sides.

          <p>A performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms in London was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters, forcing the concert to pause for over ten minutes. The group Jewish Artists for Palestine claimed responsibility, stating it was a protest against what it called "Zionist funding, censorship and complicity" in cultural institutions regarding the Gaza war. The demonstrators, holding signs in the upper gallery, shouted slogans referencing the orchestra's past cancellation of a pianist who had made pro-Gazan comments. The BBC apologized for the disruption, which was handled by security at the Royal Albert Hall before the performance resumed.</p>

          <p>As the football transfer window nears its close, several high-profile moves are being rumored across Europe's top leagues. Liverpool is reportedly preparing a record-breaking £130 million offer for Newcastle's Swedish striker Alexander Isak. Meanwhile, Manchester United has apparently agreed to a deal to send forward Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli on loan with a conditional obligation to buy. Other notable potential transfers include Brentford's rejected £45 million bid for German forward Maximilian Beier and Crystal Palace's interest in RB Leipzig's Christoph Baumgartner.

During a recent ceremony in Hong Kong, China's Science and Technology Minister Yin Hejun emphasized the city's role in supporting national development through innovation. This reform, affecting around 500 labs nationwide, aims to create more focused and efficient research hubs to compete in the global technology landscape.</p>

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than a year, citing persistent adverse market conditions. The airline plans to continue normal operations during the restructuring, honoring tickets and loyalty points while paying employees.

Spirit stated that its initial restructuring was insufficient and that more tools are needed to position the airline for future stability, which may include selling aircraft and real estate assets.</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional map. The goal is to create a new map that could help Republicans gain an additional seat in the U.S. House, likely by reconfiguring the district of Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver in the Kansas City area. This move is part of a broader, highly unusual mid-decade redistricting push by Republican-led states to solidify their congressional majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The effort has been criticized by Democrats as a partisan gerrymander intended to predetermine election outcomes.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction, sought by the local council, has been deemed "seriously flawed" by the appellate court, which criticized the lower court for not considering the difficulty of relocating the migrants. The decision is a victory for the government, which feared the initial ruling would set a precedent for other councils to block the use of hotels for asylum accommodation. Protests have occurred at the hotel, and the council may appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

In a recent interview, Carpenter defended her artistic choice, stating her interpretation is about being "in on the control" and understanding one's own power dynamics. She expressed shock at the backlash, noting that the image was not a point of concern among her family and creative team, and explained that the album explores making mistakes and learning from them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," attempts to capture the gritty, anything-goes atmosphere of 1990s New York City but ultimately falls short. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld over a case of mistaken identity. While the movie successfully evokes a nostalgic, scruffy vision of Lower Manhattan, its plot is described as a disposable, pulp-style thriller that prioritizes style over substance. Despite a talented cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, the characters are cartoonishly drawn, and Butler's natural charm makes it difficult to believe his character's supposed desperation.</p>

This move represents a significant gamble by the GOP, testing whether the gains they made with Latino voters in the previous election can be sustained.

This pivot aligns with Trump's campaign promise to make the U.S. a "crypto capital" and has been accompanied by significant deregulation.
