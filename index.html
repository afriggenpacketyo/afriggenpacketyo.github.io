          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism for changes to maternity funding that campaigners say will undermine safety improvements. Following a report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, almost Â£100m was invested annually into improving maternity safety, but new changes mean that only Â£2m of the funding is guaranteed to be spent on maternity care this year. The BBC News article details the funding changes, the concerns raised by campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives, and the Department of Health's response.</p>
