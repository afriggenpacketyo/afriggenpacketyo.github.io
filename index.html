            <p>Research reveals that paper receipts from major US retailers contain high levels of bisphenol S (BPS), a toxic chemical linked to cancer and reproductive problems. Holding a receipt for just 10 seconds can expose individuals to unsafe levels of BPS, prompting legal action against retailers to switch to safer alternatives or provide warnings. The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) has issued violation notices to numerous companies, highlighting the risk to cashiers and consumers who frequently handle receipts. This investigation raises concerns about the widespread use of BPS and the need for safer chemicals in everyday products.</p>

Despite elaborate preparations and the keepers' best efforts, the pandas have failed to mate, leading to public fascination and speculation about the reasons behind their lack of interest. The author suggests that human interference and the artificiality of their environment may be contributing factors, questioning whether the pandas simply don't know what to do. The piece highlights the challenges of breeding endangered species in captivity and the sometimes absurd nature of human attempts to control animal behavior.</p>

            <p>California's state budget is facing significant challenges due to President Trump's volatile trade policies and threats to withhold federal funds. The state's reliance on income tax from high earners, tied to the stock market, makes it particularly vulnerable to economic uncertainty. Tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries could hurt California's agricultural and tech sectors, making revenue projections difficult. The Newsom administration is attempting to develop economic forecasts for the upcoming budget year, but the unpredictable nature of federal policies adds considerable risk.</p>

US investors might be forced to sell $800 billion in Chinese stocks, while China could liquidate $1.3 trillion in US Treasury holdings and $370 billion in equities. This analysis comes as the risk of decoupling spreads beyond trade, with potential delisting of US-traded Chinese companies amid ongoing tariff wars.

            <p>A new study reveals that anxiety drugs found in rivers are altering the behavior of Atlantic salmon, causing them to take more risks during their migration. Salmon exposed to anti-anxiety medication were more successful in reaching their destination, likely due to increased boldness, but this could have negative long-term consequences for the population. Researchers implanted slow-release drugs in juvenile salmon and tracked their migration, finding that clobazam boosted their success, while tramadol had no effect. This research highlights the impact of pharmaceutical pollution on wildlife and the need for better wastewater treatment and drug design.</p>

            <p>Frustration is rising in the UK over the aggressive tariff policies pursued by US President Donald Trump, which are impacting the UK's economic growth and export sector. The UK is directly affected by new US duties on steel and automotive industries, and indirectly by the US-China trade war, which undermines investor confidence and disrupts supply chains. Concerns are growing that these policies will exacerbate the UK's cost of living crisis, as tariffs lead to price increases for consumers. The situation highlights the global economic impact of trade disputes and the challenges faced by countries caught in the crossfire.</p>

The deployment includes the use of Stryker vehicles, marking a new phase in border security efforts. While border arrest numbers are low in the Big Bend sector, officials maintain that the Army's presence is needed to secure the border and deter crossings.</p>

Despite the criticism, Wood said SNL has since apologized to her, and she appreciated the support she received from fans.</p>
