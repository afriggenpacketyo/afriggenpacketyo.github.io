          <p>Six years after a massive fire ravaged the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, its iconic towers have officially reopened to the public. French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the restored towers, marking a final major step in the nearly $1 billion reconstruction effort. Visitors can once again climb the 424 stairs to experience panoramic views of the city and see the famous gargoyles up close. The reopening fulfills Macron's promise to restore the landmark within five years, a project that has drawn praise for its remarkable speed and craftsmanship.</p>

An insider described her as an "absolute force" who intends to grow the organization tenfold, capitalizing on a surge of interest that has seen over 62,000 new chapter requests. This leadership transition is seen by supporters as a way to honor her husband's legacy and amplify the group's mission, defying expectations that the organization would falter after the tragedy.</p>

          <p>NATO forces intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated the airspace of Estonia, a member of the alliance, for a total of 12 minutes. The incursion over the Gulf of Finland was condemned by Estonian officials as "unprecedentedly brazen," prompting the nation to request Article 4 consultations with NATO. The Russian aircraft reportedly had their transponders off and failed to communicate with air traffic control. This incident is the latest in a series of airspace violations by Russia, escalating tensions along NATO's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations detailing President Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 through 2028, with the benefit phasing out for those with higher incomes. The guidance clarifies which occupations qualify, excluding specified service sectors like healthcare and legal services. It also confirms that automatic gratuities, which are not voluntary, will not be considered qualified tips eligible for the tax deduction.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, financial experts are highlighting several cost-effective ways for consumers to borrow money. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans, and personal loans are presented as among the cheapest options, with average rates currently lower than credit cards. The article notes that HELOCs offer variable rates that could decrease further with future cuts but use the home as collateral, while home equity loans provide the stability of a fixed rate.

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will raise the recommended retail prices for its Xbox Series S and Series X consoles in the U.S., effective in October. The company cited "changes in the macroeconomic environment" as the reason for the price hikes, which will see increases of $20 to $70 depending on the model. This move follows similar price adjustments by competitors Sony and Nintendo, and comes amid broader economic pressures, including tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Prices for Xbox accessories and consoles in other countries will remain unchanged.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are facing higher grocery bills due to a combination of three primary factors, according to food industry analysts. The Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods, the effects of climate change on agricultural production, and a shortage of farm labor are collectively driving up food prices. These pressures have led to significant price increases on items like coffee and have prompted some companies to engage in "shrinkflation," offering less product for the same price. Consumers are responding by seeking deals and purchasing store-brand goods.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon, a former White House strategist, has proposed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent should simultaneously serve as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, at least on an interim basis. In a podcast interview, Bannon suggested this dual role could last through the midterm elections, after which Bessent could transition to leading the Fed full-time. The White House has dismissed the idea, stating that such an arrangement has never been considered. The proposal comes as President Trump continues to criticize the current Fed leadership for its interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>State health officials in Louisiana have confirmed that five people have died in 2025 from infections caused by Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacterium found in warm coastal waters. This number of fatalities is significantly higher than the state's annual average of one death. The infections, which have resulted in at least 26 hospitalizations, typically occur when an open wound is exposed to contaminated seawater or through consumption of raw seafood. Scientists have warned that rising sea temperatures due to climate change are contributing to the increased prevalence of Vibrio bacteria.</p>

          <p>A primary suspect in the deadly 1982 terrorist attack on the Jo Goldenberg Jewish restaurant in Paris has been arrested by Palestinian authorities in the West Bank. Mahmoud Khader Abed Adra is accused of directing the gun and grenade assault that killed six people and injured over 20. The arrest, made under a 2015 international warrant, was praised by French President Emmanuel Macron, who credited the recent decision to recognize Palestinian statehood for enabling the extradition request. French officials are now working to ensure his swift transfer to France to face trial.</p>

          <p>The new film 'A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,' starring Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell, is described as a surreal and aesthetically pleasing but ultimately sluggish road trip romance. The movie follows two characters on a mystical car ride where they visit portals into each other's past memories to heal emotional scars. The review praises Colin Farrell's performance for adding emotional depth but criticizes the film's cloying style and a lack of genuine chemistry between the leads. The script's contrivances are said to be undermined by a delivery that lacks confidence and snap.</p>

          <p>In a recent performance at the Forum in Los Angeles, Nine Inch Nails delivered a powerful and timely concert that resonated with the current climate of political and social anxiety. The review highlights the band's rendition of David Bowie's "I'm Afraid of Americans" as particularly potent, capturing a sense of national unease. Led by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, the band showcased both its capacity for violent, industrial rock and its more intellectual, cinematic scoring work. The show was praised as a visceral and cathartic experience for an audience grappling with modern dread.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to dismiss Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for reportedly refusing to press criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that federal prosecutors found no clear evidence of mortgage fraud by James, yet administration officials pushed for an indictment. This anticipated firing is being described by James's attorney as a "brazen attack on the rule of law" and has caused alarm within the prominent prosecutor's office, which handles many of the nation's critical national security cases.</p>

          <p>A recent London rally led by far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew thousands of participants, many of whom traveled long distances to attend. In interviews with the BBC, attendees cited concerns over freedom of speech and a desire to express pride in their British identity as their primary motivations, rather than direct support for Robinson himself. They expressed frustration with mainstream politics and a feeling that the working class is being ignored. Counter-protesters, however, voiced fear over the divisive and racist rhetoric associated with the rally's leaders, highlighting a deepening societal divide.</p>

The report details how some sellers used stolen business identities to create accounts and sell fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly to compete with Amazon, creating what one expert called a "Wild West" environment for consumers.</p>

          <p>This political analysis from Vox outlines a potential pathway toward authoritarianism in the United States, drawing parallels to Viktor Orbán's Hungary. The article details a four-step process involving the politicization of government agencies, the suppression of dissent in civil society, exerting control over corporations through regulatory pressure, and ultimately weakening the political opposition's ability to compete in elections. Recent events, such as the pressure on broadcasters that led to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension and investigations into liberal non-profits, are presented as evidence of these tactics being actively deployed.</p>
