        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has resigned after only 26 days, citing the unwillingness of political parties to compromise within the nation's hung parliament. In his resignation speech, Lecornu criticized the "partisan appetites" that have made governing impossible, a sentiment echoing the struggles of his recent predecessors. This marks the fifth prime minister to serve under President Emmanuel Macron in under two years, deepening the country's political crisis and increasing calls from opposition leaders for new legislative elections or for Macron himself to resign.</p>

          <p>The abrupt resignation of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has intensified the country's political chaos and triggered a negative reaction in financial markets. Following the news, France's CAC 40 index slumped, and government bond yields rose, reflecting investor concern over the nation's ability to manage its significant budget deficit and public debt. Lecornu's departure underscores the deep divisions in a fractious parliament, where successive governments have failed to pass necessary fiscal reforms, leaving France in a precarious economic position.

          <p>Prosecutors in Victoria, Australia, have filed an appeal seeking to extend the non-parole period for Erin Patterson, who was sentenced to life in prison for murdering three relatives with poisonous death cap mushrooms. The Office of Public Prosecutions argues that her current sentence, which makes her eligible for parole after 33 years, is "manifestly inadequate." Patterson was convicted of feeding her estranged husband's family members a beef Wellington dish laced with the toxic fungi during a lunch at her home in 2023.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative party has unveiled a plan to offer young people a £5,000 tax rebate toward their first home when they secure their first full-time job. The proposal, dubbed a "first-job bonus," would work by diverting an individual's National Insurance payments into a dedicated long-term savings account. To fund this initiative, the party has outlined £47 billion in public spending cuts over five years, targeting areas such as the welfare bill, civil service staffing levels, and the foreign aid budget.

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine has been jointly awarded to American researchers Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Japanese immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi. The Nobel Assembly recognized them for their foundational discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance, the mechanism that prevents the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. Their work has been instrumental in creating a new field of research and has spurred the development of innovative treatments for cancer and various autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has reported that its agents shot and wounded a woman in Chicago during a chaotic confrontation on Saturday. According to the agency, the incident occurred after patrolling agents had their vehicles rammed and were "boxed in by 10 cars" near an ICE facility that has been a site of ongoing protests. The shooting has heightened tensions between demonstrators and the federal law enforcement personnel deployed to several US cities by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Filmmakers from both Israel and Palestine are facing increasing difficulties in securing international distribution for their movies, especially in Western countries with polarized debates over the Gaza conflict. The article highlights that even critically acclaimed and award-winning films are struggling to find distributors willing to take them on. This trend points to a chilling effect on artistic expression, where the political climate makes it a commercial risk for companies to be associated with stories from the region.</p>

          <p>A group of 176 Zambian farmers has filed a lawsuit against two local subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned mining companies, alleging that a toxic spill has caused an "ecological catastrophe." The lawsuit claims that a tailings dam wall collapsed in February, releasing acidic waste that contaminated streams, rivers, and farms, thereby destroying their crops, livestock, and livelihoods.

This crackdown was initiated after two police officers were fatally shot in another state by a suspect who had reportedly embraced similar anti-government views. Authorities used a legal provision allowing them to revoke permits from anyone deemed not a "fit and proper person," arguing that rejecting the rule of law disqualifies one from owning firearms.</p>

          <p>Motor neurone disease, or MND, is a progressive and terminal condition that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakening and wasting. While the disease is relatively rare and its exact causes are not fully understood, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Recent attention has focused on a potential correlation with elite contact sports, as several studies have suggested that professional athletes in sports like rugby and football may face an increased risk of developing the condition.</p>

The incident is now Indonesia's deadliest disaster of the year, and while an official probe is underway, experts have suggested that poor construction quality was a likely contributing factor.</p>

The ruling expanded on a previous order that had only blocked the use of Oregon's own guard members.
