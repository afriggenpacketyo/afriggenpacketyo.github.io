        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Jersey Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted on three federal assault charges after a clash with law enforcement outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges stem from an incident in May where McIver and other lawmakers attempted to oversee the Delaney Hall detention center, leading to a scuffle between protesters and law enforcement. A Homeland Security agent alleges McIver used her forearm to strike agents and restrain them from arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was also arrested but had his charges dropped. McIver denies the charges, calling them a politically motivated attempt at intimidation by the Trump administration, as Alina Habba, who announced the indictment, is a close ally and served as Trump's personal attorney.</p>

He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy, which respects human rights and the sanctity of life, also noting the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. Elbegdorj points to a decrease in violent crimes in Mongolia after the death penalty was abolished, suggesting it does not have a deterrent effect.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in the Los Angeles area to support National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit to block the deployment of troops onto city streets. The state argues that the presence of soldiers has caused irreparable damage to the city and its residents. The U.S. Northern Command stated that the Marines will "seamlessly integrate" with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that the tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every country can remain in place until at least the end of July. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs pending appeal. Oral arguments are scheduled for July 31, meaning the tariffs will remain in effect unless further court action occurs. The tariffs, imposed on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, have been justified by Trump using a 1977 law allowing import regulation during emergencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., argues his case is about due process rights, not just immigration. Chris Newman, representing Garcia's family, contends that the Trump administration is trying to make the case a referendum on immigration. Garcia faces charges of human smuggling after being deported to El Salvador despite a judge's order, an error the administration admits. Newman says Garcia's case is a fight to preserve constitutional institutions, warning of the erosion of due process rights.</p>
