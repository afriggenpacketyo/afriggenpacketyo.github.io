          <p>The BBC is under criticism following a performance by the punk duo Bob Vylan at Glastonbury, during which the band led a chant of "death, death to the IDF." The set was live-streamed on the BBC's iPlayer platform after the corporation had reportedly deemed the band "high risk." In response to the controversy, BBC director-general Tim Davie has stated that the corporation is taking action to ensure accountability for the broadcast. Several staff members from the music and live events team have reportedly been moved from their usual duties.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has narrowly advanced President Trump's significant tax and spending package after a prolonged overnight session. Republican leadership faced considerable resistance from within their own party over changes made to the bill by the Senate, delaying the key procedural vote for hours. The legislation, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on defense and border security while cutting health and nutrition programs, is now set for a final debate and vote. The passage required direct intervention from President Trump to persuade holdouts to support the measure.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea in the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, prosecutors revealed crucial details about the investigation. Key evidence included a Q-tip with his father's DNA retrieved from family trash, which linked Kohberger to DNA found on a knife sheath at the crime scene. Cell phone data placed him near the victims' home multiple times before the attack, and surveillance footage tracked his car. While the evidence trail is now clear, Kohberger's motive and the reason for targeting the specific victims remain unanswered questions.</p>

The legislation combines over $3 trillion in tax cuts, primarily benefiting the wealthy, with more than $1.4 trillion in cuts to essential programs like Medicaid and food assistance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would result in a net income loss for the bottom 30% of Americans while increasing the federal debt by $3.3 trillion.

Scientists warn that the administration's actions, including the abrupt cancellation of over 1,600 active grants and interference from the "department of government efficiency" (Doge), are compromising the peer-review process. This assault on scientific funding and diversity is causing a "soul-sucking" environment, leading to a potential loss of a generation of scientific talent to competitors like China and jeopardizing future U.S. innovation.</p>

The author suggests that just as with past technological shifts like the personal computer, learning to use AI effectively can be a crucial skill.

Forensic analysis of her remains also detected a chemical compound used for tranquilizing wildlife, a substance Barry Morphew had access to and admitted using on deer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing has fallen after a recent surge, with the yield on 10-year bonds decreasing. The market stabilization followed Prime Minister Keir Starmer's expression of support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who had become emotional in Parliament after a major U-turn on welfare reform created a £5 billion budget deficit. Analysts believe the market's positive reaction reflects a fear that losing Reeves could lead to weaker fiscal discipline. The movement in bond yields is significant as it can influence the cost of new mortgage deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the prevalence of ultra-processed foods and chemical additives in the American diet, particularly highlighted during holidays like the Fourth of July. It contrasts U.S. food standards with those in Europe, where many additives like Red Dye 40 and titanium dioxide are banned or restricted due to health concerns. While Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is pushing for reforms, the piece argues the core issue is not just additives but the overall American diet, which is high in sugar, saturated fats, and excessive calories, contributing to poor national health outcomes.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, or "narco sub," for the first time, discovered off its Caribbean coast. The drone vessel was equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna, indicating a technological advancement for drug trafficking cartels. Although the sub was empty and believed to be on a trial run by the Gulf Clan, it had the capacity to carry 1.5 tons of cocaine. This seizure highlights a shift towards sophisticated, unmanned systems that are difficult to detect and reduce the risk of crew capture for trafficking organizations.</p>

          <p>In a significant decision, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court has ruled that a 175-year-old statute from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. The ruling effectively preserves legal access to abortion services throughout the state. This decision resolves a key legal question that arose following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, which had created uncertainty about the enforceability of the pre-Civil War era law. The judgment provides clarity and ensures that abortion remains legal in Wisconsin for the time being.</p>

The club has reportedly explored deals for strikers like Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig and Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon, with the latter gaining backing from new sporting director Andrea Berta. In addition to a striker, Arsenal is also targeting wingers and attacking midfielders, with players like Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze on their list. The club's spending on these positions may necessitate selling an established first-team player.</p>

          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) has found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed. The delays were caused by Manchester City Council providing heavily redacted evidence to the police, with some documents having only a few visible words. This made it impossible for investigators to assess the material's value. While the force's handling of such cases has since improved, the report notes that past failings have led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" from victims and survivors.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent actions, including the passage of his domestic spending bill and military strikes on Iran, confirm his alignment with past political ideologies. The author contends that instead of breaking from the "swamp," Trump has doubled down on both neoliberalism, exemplified by tax cuts for the rich and welfare cuts, and neoconservatism, seen in his belligerent foreign policy. The article concludes that Trump's presidency ultimately represents a continuity of the dominant American political consensus of the last 50 years, rather than a radical departure.</p>

          <p>Federal contractors cleaning up debris from the Eaton and Palisades wildfires improperly sent truckloads of asbestos-contaminated waste to nonhazardous landfills in Southern California. According to state and local records, Environmental Chemical Corp., the primary contractor for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, failed to review asbestos test results before shipping the debris. The incident, which went unreported for weeks, has amplified concerns among residents and environmental groups about the health risks posed to landfill workers and nearby communities from toxic wildfire waste.</p>

          <h2>Politicization and Contradictions Erode Trust in U.S. Government Health Guidance</h2>

          <p>Public health guidance from U.S. government agencies like the CDC and NIH is becoming increasingly chaotic and politicized, eroding public trust. The article points to instances of government websites being altered or taken down, and official pages being appended with disclaimers that contradict scientific consensus, particularly on topics like gender and climate change. Health professionals express deep concern, stating this political interference is creating confusion for both providers and the public. This trend marks a significant departure from the U.S. government's former role as a global leader in reliable public health information.</p>

          <h2>LAPD Faces Scrutiny Over Responses to 911 Calls Reporting ICE Agents as Kidnappers</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is grappling with a surge in 911 calls from residents reporting potential kidnappings that turn out to be federal immigration enforcement actions. Critics have blasted the LAPD for appearing to protect ICE agents, who are often in plain clothes and unmarked vehicles, rather than investigating the detentions. In response, city leaders are questioning the department's role in the federal crackdown, and the LAPD has created new guidelines requiring supervisors to verify agents' identities. The incidents have heightened fear and eroded public trust in immigrant communities.</p>
