          <p>Elon Musk announced that Tesla's robotaxi service is "tentatively" scheduled to begin in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with plans for a small initial rollout of about 10 to 20 robotaxis. These vehicles will use a new, "unsupervised" version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and will be geofenced, with remote monitoring by employees. Musk emphasized the company's commitment to safety, noting that the date could be shifted if necessary, and shared a video of a Model Y navigating Austin roads without a human safety supervisor. The first ride from the factory to a customer's house is planned for June 28.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department plans to adopt a more targeted strategy in prosecuting corporate bribery cases occurring overseas. According to officials, this adjustment aims to align the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act with the broader objective of enhancing the United States' capacity to compete on a global scale. This refined approach suggests a shift towards prioritizing cases that have a significant impact on international trade and competition, while potentially reducing the focus on less consequential instances of corporate misconduct. The change reflects an effort to balance the need for ethical business practices with the desire to support American businesses in the international arena.</p>

Wang is expected to lead a new AI research lab at Meta, aiming to improve Meta's AI capabilities and execution, especially after the lukewarm reception of the Llama 4 AI models. This strategic move mirrors similar approaches by Google and Microsoft, which have brought in AI leaders from other startups to bolster their AI divisions.</p>

The Raising the Nation Play Commission reports that outdoor play in England has declined by 50% in a generation, attributing this to traffic-dominated streets, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The commission calls for a national Play Strategy for England, which includes updating planning policies to involve children in new developments and protecting play during school breaks.

          <p>Davante Adams, the three-time All-Pro receiver, is reportedly fitting in well with the Los Angeles Rams after signing a free-agent contract in March. Adams stated he feels "rejuvenated" and has quickly immersed himself in the Rams' offense and culture. He is expected to be a key weapon for quarterback Matthew Stafford and coach Sean McVay, adding to a receiver corps that includes Puka Nacua, Tutu Atwell, and Jordan Whittington. Adams' experience and understanding of the game through a quarterback's perspective have impressed the coaching staff and his teammates.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement has raised legal questions about the president's authority to mobilize troops on U.S. soil. Despite objections from local officials, President Trump relied on a federal law to federalize National Guard troops, asserting the need to protect federal officers and enforce immigration laws. Experts debate whether the president can activate National Guard troops without the order of the state's governor, while concerns arise about the potential for escalation and the role of military forces in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is bracing for the arrival of U.S. Marines following days of protests against federal immigration raids, sparking concerns about the deployment of active-duty troops with unclear objectives. While officials state that the Marines are there to defend federal property and personnel without arrest power, military experts raise questions about the appropriateness of using Marines trained for overseas conflict zones in a domestic setting. The deployment, which lacks a request from the governor, is seen as a potentially explosive move that could inflame the situation, with legal experts questioning whether it violates the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his administration officials warned that the deployment of the military in response to protests against his immigration crackdown in Los Angeles could be the first "of many" and that protesters could be met with "equal or greater force."

The president's threats come as California's leaders and 22 Democratic governors decry Trump's show of force as a breach of the state's sovereignty and a provocative escalation.</p>

Despite three wins against modest opposition, the team's performance against Senegal was described as dismal and alarming.
