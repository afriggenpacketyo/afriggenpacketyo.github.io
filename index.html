          <p>Bitcoin's price is surging, heading towards $95,000, fueled by easing trade war tensions and a softening stance from President Trump towards the Federal Reserve. Exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin saw significant inflows, indicating strengthened interest in the cryptocurrency as a hedge against market turbulence. Short sellers are covering positions, further driving up the price. Demand for spot Bitcoin is contracting monthly, but at a slower pace, requiring sustained growth to reach new all-time highs.

          <p>International tourism to the United States is slumping, with air travel down nearly 10% in March compared to the previous year, while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas, with a 1.6% increase in outbound flights. This imbalance could widen the existing $50 billion gap between U.S. travel and tourism revenue and American spending abroad. Factors contributing to the decline in international visitors include trade war tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar. JPMorgan suggests this decline could subtract around 0.1% from the U.S. GDP this year.</p>

While food standards remain a sticking point, with the UK unwilling to reduce them, a document suggests the US wants UK tariffs on US cars lowered from 10% to 2.5%.

          <p>China has sent back Boeing planes it ordered from the US as retaliation for Trump's tariffs, according to Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg. Two planes have already been returned, and another is expected to follow suit, amidst escalating trade tensions between the two countries. Boeing is assessing options to re-market 41 already-built planes to other customers, due to high demand from other airlines. Trump stated that the level of tariffs he had imposed would "come down substantially, but it won't be zero."</p>

          <p>The David Frum Show features a discussion with former Acting Attorney General Peter Keisler on the Trump administration's approach to due process, particularly regarding the detention and deportation of individuals without hearings. Keisler criticizes the administration's "contempt" for court orders and its legal strategy to circumvent due process. The conversation explores the potential for executive overreach and the role of the courts in upholding the rule of law. Frum and Keisler also discuss the importance of defending legal and ethical norms against political expediency.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that blood tests could predict the return of skin cancer by examining levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The study showed that 80% of stage 3 melanoma patients with detectable ctDNA experienced a cancer recurrence. Early detection through ctDNA analysis could save lives, as melanoma is difficult to treat once it has spread. Researchers plan to improve the sensitivity of the tests to reduce cases where cancer returns despite negative ctDNA tests.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, the owner of a paddleboard firm, was sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding trip she led. The incident occurred on the Western Cleddau river in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, in October 2021, where participants encountered hazardous conditions. Lloyd, an ex-police officer, pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour. The court heard that Lloyd's "abysmal" approach to health and safety, coupled with the fact that neither she nor her co-instructor were qualified to lead the tour, directly contributed to the deaths.</p>

The tiered structure could be phased in over five years.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. has an "opportunity for a big deal" with China, hinting at a potential easing of the tariff war.

He also commented on the IMF and World Bank, stating they need to be made "fit for purpose" again and have strayed from their initial missions.
