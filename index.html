          <p>An essay argues that President Trump's actions to enlarge executive power are rooted in a longer tradition of right-wing thought, rather than simply expanding the unitary executive theory. The author contends that Trump's administration is reaching for monarchical and dictatorial rule. The author argues that President Trump's bold assertions of executive power can be traced back to proposals from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. The author expresses concern that this expansive view of executive power threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office.</p>

Gregory Abel, Buffett's designated successor, is expected to take over at the end of the year. While the future of Berkshire appears financially stable, some worry about the company's ability to maintain its unique culture and investment acumen without Buffett at the helm.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a highly damaging statement in relationships. This phrase, often used during arguments, conveys the message that the partner is not good enough and that someone else would be a better fit. The root cause is a fear of openly expressing needs, leading to accumulated frustrations and eventual comparisons. Open communication, free of shame and comparison, is essential for a healthy relationship, according to the psychologist.</p>

Monte Anderson, a developer in Dallas, is converting existing homes into "roommate houses" to create more affordable rental units. Cities and states are encouraging similar ideas by easing regulations on accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and lot subdivisions. The goal is to add housing in existing neighborhoods without causing disruption, catering to changing household compositions and the need for more diverse housing options.</p>
