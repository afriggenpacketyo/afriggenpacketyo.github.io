          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Israel to affirm continued U.S. support despite recent policy disagreements between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding Iran, Yemen, and the war in Gaza. Noem met with Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Saar, attending a ceremony commemorating Israeli Embassy aides killed in a Washington shooting, conveying Trump's condolences and solidarity. Israeli leaders highlighted the visit as evidence of strong U.S.-Israel relations, while Noem expressed unwavering support for Netanyahu and his handling of the war. She also met with National Security Minister Ben-Gvir, who thanked her for American support and Trump's plan to displace Gaza residents during rebuilding efforts. Optimism is slightly tempered given the context of ongoing conflict and political disagreements.</p>

          <p>President Trump pardoned Scott Jenkins, a Virginia sheriff convicted of federal bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison, who was due to report to jail. Trump criticized the Biden DOJ and the judge in the case, claiming Jenkins was unfairly persecuted and evidence was suppressed. Jenkins was convicted in December 2024 for accepting over $75,000 in exchange for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. The DOJ stated that Jenkins had violated his oath of office by engaging in a cash-for-badges scheme, and the pardon has sparked controversy regarding the integrity of law enforcement and political influence.</p>

For decades, California has set stringent pollution limits, influencing national standards due to its large consumer market, with Republicans resenting this influence. Republicans argue that electric vehicles are impractical for rural states and oppose California's "extreme environmental agenda." California officials vow to fight in court to preserve their autonomy in setting emissions rules, emphasizing the state's history of environmental leadership and technological innovation.</p>

          <p>A report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates that the "true rate" of unemployment in April stood at 24.3%, significantly higher than the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate of 4.2%. LISEP's measure includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time employment but unable to find it, and individuals in poverty-wage jobs, aiming to capture nuances missed by other indicators. This measure considers individuals working part-time or earning below a poverty wage as functionally unemployed, struggling to afford basic needs. The report reveals disparities among racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers facing higher rates of functional unemployment, suggesting a need for improved employment opportunities and wages.

Despite acknowledging the severity of the situation, Trump's refusal to take concrete action has created a strategic void, drawing criticism from experts and former officials. Trump's pattern of complaining about Russia's actions while remaining unwilling to make Putin pay a price has raised concerns about the U.S.'s commitment to supporting Ukraine.

          <p>President Trump's Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery honored military veterans but also included partisan remarks and personal boasting, deviating from traditional solemnity. While paying tribute to fallen soldiers, Trump inserted comments about "fixing" the republic and criticized immigration policies, drawing cheers from supporters. He promoted the upcoming 250th anniversary of the US Army and highlighted future events like the World Cup and Olympics, expressing satisfaction with his current presidential term. Trump's remarks drew attention for mixing political messaging with a day of remembrance, sparking debate over the appropriateness of his approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed tariffs on the European Union by over a month, prompting a renewed push for a trade deal between the U.S. and the E.U., with officials from both sides expressing optimism. Despite ongoing discussions, differences in priorities remain, including U.S. demands for changes to European consumption tax systems and digital regulations. The E.U. hopes to reduce tariffs implemented in April and has suggested cutting tariffs on industrial goods to zero, while preparing retaliatory tariffs on American imports. The goal is to reach a solution before July 9, but challenges persist in aligning demands and offers.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles, once a mainstay in the early 20th century, faded due to the rise of cheaper gasoline-powered cars and political factors, and this history may be repeating itself. The Trump administration is working to undercut the growth of electric vehicles and favor oil, echoing the tax incentives that boosted the oil industry in the 1920s. Concerns about charging infrastructure and convenience persist, similar to challenges faced by early electric cars, while gender stereotypes and political polarization also play a role. Despite global growth in electric vehicle sales, the U.S. market faces policy uncertainty and potential setbacks, raising concerns about the future of the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are urging investors to brace for ongoing market turbulence, as President Trump's decision to postpone implementing 50% tariffs on the European Union does not eliminate the possibility of a trade conflict. Despite the delay until July 9, the EU and US still face significant hurdles in reaching a trade agreement, with uncertain political will and differing objectives. Experts suggest the EU is unlikely to succumb to Trump's shock tactics, while the U.S. administration's exact demands remain unclear, making negotiations challenging. Market watchers caution that sectors like tech and industrials could face volatility, as the delay may only be a temporary reprieve before a larger tariff showdown.</p>

          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four U.S. airmen killed in the 1944 crash of the WWII bomber "Heaven Can Wait" are returning to their hometowns, thanks to family research and a Navy recovery mission. The B-24 bomber was shot down off New Guinea, and for decades, the remains of the 11 crew members were considered non-recoverable. Family members, led by Scott Althaus, conducted a years-long investigation to locate the crash site, leading to a recovery mission by Project Recover and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.

Despite the drop in earnings, revenue growth of 15% may be attracting investors, with insider buying in the last three months indicating confidence.

Despite his potential, Scott has been leaving too many pitches in the middle of the strike zone, resulting in hitters making solid contact. The Dodgers' coaching staff is encouraging Scott to aim for more chase outside the zone, even if it means issuing more walks, to improve his effectiveness. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial for the Dodgers, making these adjustments essential for stabilizing their bullpen.</p>

Rangel was the last surviving member of the venerable group of Harlem elder statesmen known as the Gang of Four. Although he ventured politically beyond Harlem only once, unsuccessfully seeking the Democratic nomination for City Council president in 1969, he won re-election with monster margins in a district where, by 2010, only about one in three residents was Black.</p>
