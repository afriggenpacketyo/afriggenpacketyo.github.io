          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices to train an AI model without proper consent, after initially contracting them for work described for internal or academic use only. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims regarding their voices as a unique entity, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to the training data will proceed. The case highlights the growing legal challenges AI companies face regarding the use of creative work for training their systems.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their international presence to meet the growing demand from Chinese companies expanding their operations abroad. As these corporations move into global markets, they show a strong preference for legal support from domestic firms, citing greater trust and understanding. This expansion is also encouraged by Beijing as a way to support its national enterprises. However, these law firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients, particularly amidst rising geopolitical tensions. The number of Chinese legal offices overseas has seen a substantial 70% increase since 2018, marking a pivotal moment for the country's legal services sector.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old rock climber, identified as Brian Astle of Provo, Utah, died after falling while descending a route on Mount Gould in Montana's Glacier National Park. The incident occurred on the evening of July 9, and park officials were alerted shortly after the fall. A search and rescue operation located the climber, but the recovery of his body was postponed until the following morning to ensure the safety of the rescue crews. The National Park Service has extended its condolences to the family and stated that an investigation into the fatal accident is currently ongoing, with no further details available at this time.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order to stop the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on race or ethnicity. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting claims that agents violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The order also mandates that officials provide detainees at a specific Los Angeles facility with access to legal counsel, a right lawyers claimed was being denied. This decision represents a significant, albeit temporary, legal check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are scrutinizing the safety of portable power banks after several incidents of defective units catching fire on commercial flights. In response, China's Civil Aviation Administration implemented an emergency ban on June 28, prohibiting passengers from carrying power banks that lack the mandatory 3C safety certification. This has caused confusion and led to large numbers of devices being abandoned at airports. The issue escalated after aviation authorities across Asia began enforcing rules in April that restrict the charging of power banks during flights. The State Administration for Market Regulation is expected to complete its review of power bank products and batteries by the end of July.</p>

Frontman Ben Schneider attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship, allowing listeners to connect with it personally.

The 123-year-old steel bridge is an iconic part of the city's skyline, but officials argue it is corroded and can no longer handle the growing rail traffic. Their proposal involves building a new, three-track bridge and moving the old structure to a different location for pedestrian use. However, a coalition of experts, endorsed by UNESCO, claims the original bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption, preserving its cultural heritage while still meeting transport needs.

According to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they had cut the fuel, which the other pilot denied doing. The switches were flipped within one second of each other, just three seconds into the flight, causing both engines to lose thrust. The report does not assign blame or determine if the action was intentional or accidental, but it suggests the cause was human action in the cockpit rather than a mechanical failure of the aircraft or its engines.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma beach resort, welcoming its first group of Russian tourists this week. The large-scale coastal development, which leader Kim Jong Un has hailed as a world-class destination, was constructed rapidly, raising concerns from human rights organizations about the use of forced labor. The UN and former North Korean insiders report that "shock brigades" of workers likely faced brutal conditions and long hours to complete the project. The resort is part of North Korea's effort to boost its sanctioned economy and strengthen ties with Russia, though experts are skeptical that it will become a popular destination for Russian tourists, who have access to superior and less restrictive holiday options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An exceptionally intense and early marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea is raising significant concerns among scientists about its impact on marine life. In late June and early July, sea surface temperatures surpassed 30°C (86°F) in some areas, which is up to seven degrees above the seasonal average and warmer than many swimming pools. Experts warn that such prolonged and extreme heat can be devastating for many species, including vital seaweeds and seagrasses that form the foundation of the marine ecosystem. This event, driven by global warming, could lead to mass mortality events, disrupt fisheries, and increase the risk of harmful algae blooms, highlighting the Mediterranean's vulnerability as a climate change hotspot.</p>

          <p>A top Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of overseeing an overly expensive and potentially unlawful office renovation, escalating the White House's criticism of the central bank chief. In a letter, Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought claimed the project included "ostentatious" features and questioned whether the Fed sought proper approval for changes to the plan. This criticism follows months of President Trump's attacks on Powell over interest rate policy. Powell has defended the renovation, stating that descriptions of it have been misleading and that the project is necessary to update buildings that haven't been overhauled since the 1930s.

The visit came as search and rescue operations continued, with thousands of volunteers assisting in the massive effort. The region's summer camps were hit particularly hard, with 27 young girls attending Camp Mystic among the deceased.

          <p>On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the landmark South China Sea arbitration ruling, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has reiterated Beijing's firm rejection of the decision. Speaking at a foreign ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Wang described the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which favored the Philippines, as a "farce" that was manipulated by external powers to destabilize the region for their own benefit. He asserted that China is committed to maintaining regional stability and is actively negotiating a code of conduct with ASEAN nations. This statement comes amid renewed tensions in the disputed waters and growing speculation about a potential second legal challenge from the Philippines.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data and a stark report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the UK is facing significant financial challenges, likely leading to tax increases in the autumn. The OBR warned that government debt could reach unsustainable levels and that current spending promises are unaffordable without fiscal adjustments. This pressure, combined with global economic uncertainty from U.S. tariffs, is expected to compel Chancellor Rachel Reeves to raise taxes by £10bn to £20bn to stabilize public finances. The government faces difficult choices to meet its self-imposed borrowing limits amid a gloomy economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam winner, has historically found grass to be her most challenging surface, but has found formidable form during the tournament. Anisimova, a former teenage prodigy, is reaching her potential after taking a break from tennis for her mental health, playing with an aggressive, nothing-to-lose style. While Swiatek has the edge in major finals experience, Anisimova's underdog status may allow her to play more freely. The match will be their first meeting at the tour level, promising a compelling contest of contrasting pressures and styles.</p>

While reaffirming the importance of the U.S. alliance and the AUKUS security pact, Albanese's government is signaling a recalibration of its international relationships.

On tracks like "Walking Away," he reaffirms his commitment to his marriage, while other songs celebrate his wife's success and their journey into parenthood. The album also incorporates viral moments from his recent paparazzi encounters, turning his much-memed use of vernacular into a self-aware commentary on the pressures of fame and the public's perception of his mental health.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if President Donald Trump proceeds with a threatened 50% tariff. Trump's proposed tariff is linked to Brazil's criminal trial against his political ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a move widely seen as an attempt to interfere in Brazil's domestic affairs. President Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will invoke its reciprocity law to match any U.S. tariffs. The escalating trade dispute has created rare political unity in Brazil against what is being described as foreign interference, potentially complicating the U.S. administration's strategy.

While the production company Banijay investigates the claims, the BBC has not commented on whether the completed series will be aired, shelved, or edited. Broadcasting the series could be seen as disrespectful to the accusers, but canceling it would be a major disappointment for the contestants and crew who invested their time and effort.
