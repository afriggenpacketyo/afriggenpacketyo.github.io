          <p>Todd Arrington, director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, was reportedly forced to resign after a conflict with the Trump administration. The dispute centered on a request to give an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection to King Charles III as a state gift. Arrington resisted giving away a historical artifact belonging to the American people, suggesting a replica instead. Although a substitute was ultimately gifted, Arrington stated he was told to "resign — or be fired," allegedly over concerns he could no longer be trusted with confidential information.</p>

Democrats are insisting on addressing healthcare provisions, while Republicans are pushing for a clean stopgap measure. The White House has indicated that mass firings of federal workers are "very real" and could begin within days, with President Trump viewing the shutdown as an opportunity to cut programs and agencies aligned with his political opponents. Both parties continue to blame each other for the impasse, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers in limbo.</p>

The assailant used a vehicle to ram into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation before exiting and continuing the attack with a knife. Armed police responded within minutes and shot the attacker, who was wearing what appeared to be an explosive vest but was later confirmed to be non-viable. The incident is being treated as a terrorist act, and authorities have praised the bravery of security staff who prevented the attacker from entering the building.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Prime Air delivery service is under investigation by the FAA and NTSB after two of its MK30 drones collided with a construction crane in Tolleson, Arizona. Both drones sustained significant damage while returning to a nearby warehouse and crashed into the backyard of a building. The company has temporarily suspended its drone operations in the area pending the investigation. This incident follows previous crashes at a test site in Oregon, raising further questions about the safety and reliability of the company's autonomous sense-and-avoid systems as it pursues its goal of large-scale drone delivery.</p>

          <p>Musician Keith Urban has been seen in public for the first time since his wife, actress Nicole Kidman, filed for divorce after a long marriage. He was photographed arriving at an airport in Pennsylvania ahead of a scheduled concert performance, and was notably not wearing his wedding ring. Kidman initiated the divorce proceedings citing "irreconcilable differences" and has requested primary residential custody of their two minor children. The couple was last seen together publicly in June, and representatives for both have not yet commented on the separation.</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Intel have risen dramatically, climbing over 50% in the last month to their highest level in 18 months. This surge has increased the value of the U.S. government's 10% stake in the company to approximately $16 billion. The government's investment was part of a strategic move by the Trump administration to bolster domestic chip manufacturing, funded by grants from the CHIPS and Science Act. The stock's recovery is also attributed to new leadership and significant investments from other major tech companies like Nvidia, signaling renewed confidence in the formerly struggling semiconductor giant.

          <p>A small, long-running protest outside an ICE facility in Portland, Oregon, has drawn the attention of President Trump, who has threatened to deploy the National Guard to disperse what he calls "domestic terrorists." An observer at the encampment describes the atmosphere as more akin to a carnival than a war zone, with a diverse group of demonstrators engaged in ritualized, often non-violent confrontations with federal agents. The protest, amplified by right-wing media, has become a spectacle, reflecting Portland's history of social unrest and its current role in the national political drama.

While these payments are lower than they were in early 2025, the article notes that the decrease is not dramatic.

Her attorneys have argued for clemency, citing her history of severe mental illness and childhood abuse, evidence which was not presented at her original trial.

          <p>A new book, "Extraction" by Thea Riofrancos, examines the significant, often overlooked, costs associated with the green energy transition, particularly the mining of essential minerals like lithium and cobalt. The article discusses how this extraction disproportionately harms Indigenous and poor communities through water contamination, displacement, and economic disruption. Riofrancos argues that the perceived paradox of harming the environment to save it is a false choice created by a limited vision. Instead of simply replacing gas cars with electric ones, she advocates for systemic changes like robust mass transit, which could reduce mineral demand.</p>

          <p>An immigration judge has denied a request to reopen the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was erroneously deported earlier this year despite having legal protection against removal. Abrego Garcia was later returned to the U.S. to face federal human smuggling charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers had sought to reopen his immigration proceedings to allow him to apply for asylum, but the judge's denial leaves his future in the U.S. uncertain. Abrego Garcia can still appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals while he remains in immigration custody.</p>

          <p>In a significant escalation of its anti-drug trafficking efforts, the Trump administration has declared drug cartels operating in the Caribbean to be "unlawful combatants." According to a White House memo, this designation frames the U.S. as being in a "non-international armed conflict" with these groups. The move follows recent U.S. military strikes on three boats in the Caribbean that killed 17 people, which the administration claims were carrying members of a Venezuelan drug gang. This new classification could provide a broader legal justification for military action against cartels, which the administration has increasingly linked to state actors.</p>

          <p>With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates falling to 6.34% from nearly 7% at the start of the year, the cost of borrowing has decreased for homebuyers. For a $700,000 mortgage, this rate drop translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351, which is about $273 less per month than it would have been in January. Over the full 30-year term, this difference could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest.

The flotilla organizers described the action as illegal and an "act of desperation." The incident has drawn international criticism, with Colombia expelling Israeli diplomats in protest, and the UN calling for Israel to lift its blockade on Gaza to allow for the entry of life-saving materials.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac (FICO), the company behind the widely used credit scoring system, has announced a major change to its business model, causing its stock to rally over 20%. The new plan will allow mortgage lenders to license FICO scores directly from the company, bypassing the three major credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—which traditionally acted as intermediaries. This move is intended to eliminate markups and give lenders more choice. Consequently, shares for the credit bureaus fell, as investors speculated the change could diminish their role in the mortgage lending process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has demonstrated that artificial intelligence can be used to create DNA sequences for toxic proteins that are capable of bypassing existing biosecurity measures. Researchers used an AI tool to generate thousands of variants of hazardous proteins, finding that the screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies failed to consistently flag them as dangerous. While a fix was quickly developed for the screening software, it is not yet perfect. The findings highlight growing concerns about the potential misuse of powerful AI and biological tools and have led the researchers to restrict access to their full data.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in the journal *Science* reveals that the economic damage from wildfires has accelerated dramatically, particularly in the last decade, with rising global temperatures being a key driver.

Many of these catastrophic events occurred during periods of extreme heat and drought. The study highlights that the human and financial impacts of wildfires are growing disproportionately, putting increasing strain on economies, insurance systems, and communities.</p>
