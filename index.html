            <p>An Israeli military investigation into the deaths of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month found 'professional failures' leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation determined that soldiers mistakenly identified ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants due to poor visibility, despite the ambulances displaying visible lights and logos. The incident involved troops bulldozing over the bodies and vehicles, burying them in a mass grave, though the investigation denied claims of executions. While the military regrets the harm to civilians, the findings have been turned over to the Military Advocate General to decide whether to file charges.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to investigate the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident deported despite a court order, emphasizing the importance of due process. Van Hollen criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case, alleging Abrego Garcia was wrongfully detained and deported, and accused the El Salvador government of complicity. He met with Abrego Garcia, who described the trauma of his abduction and detention, and stressed the need to uphold constitutional rights.

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in Alaska LNG, a massive natural gas project, to navigate trade tensions with the Trump administration and avoid tariffs. The project, long delayed, is gaining momentum with Trump's support and could help reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Taiwan's CPC Corp. has already signed a letter of intent to purchase gas from the project, and other Asian countries have expressed interest. The project aligns with Trump's goal of U.S. energy dominance and could provide a more efficient route for LNG exports to Asia.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry attributed the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza to an 'operational misunderstanding,' stating troops believed they were facing a threat. The inquiry cited 'poor night visibility' as a factor, preventing the commander from identifying the vehicles as ambulances. The IDF claimed six of the casualties were Hamas members but provided no evidence. The deputy commander involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report. The report acknowledged that the initial claim that the convoy approached suspiciously was mistaken after video evidence surfaced showing the vehicles with lights on.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, a marketplace for used tech devices, reports a tripling of sales following President Trump's tariff announcements. The tariffs, potentially raising prices on new electronics, are incentivizing Americans to consider used or refurbished options. Analysts predict a short-term surge in sales of used devices, particularly smartphones, if tariffs are implemented. While most Americans currently prefer new devices, the CEO believes tariffs could shift consumer behavior towards more cost-effective alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The article questions the reliability of commonly cited economic indicators, such as consumer sentiment and unemployment, in predicting recessions. The author argues that many metrics lack empirical evidence and are difficult to accurately measure. Instead, the author suggests focusing on data from companies driving key economic components: retailers, banks, and payroll companies. By analyzing actual data from these sources, such as earnings reports and employment figures, one can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's health than relying on surveys or government data.</p>

            <p>Justice Samuel Alito dissented from the Supreme Court's temporary block on the Trump administration's deportation of Venezuelans, arguing the court acted 'literally in the middle of the night' without sufficient explanation. Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, cited 'dubious factual support' for the ACLU's emergency appeal and questioned the court's jurisdiction. He argued the court intervened prematurely, without hearing from the government or allowing lower courts to rule. The majority's order directed the administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>But investors can prepare for volatility, said certified financial planner Lee Baker, owner of Apex Financial Services in Atlanta. "Turmoil has happened before, and it will happen again," said Baker, who is a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. Whether you're facing tariff-induced selloffs or another drawdown, there are some key strategies to weigh before retirement.

'Protect your nest egg'

After several years of stock market growth, it's important to "protect your nest egg" by rebalancing based on your risk tolerance and timeline, said CFP Jon Ulin, managing principal of Ulin & Co. Wealth Management in Boca Raton, Florida. If you're in your early 60s, you may shift assets closer to a 60/40 investment portfolio, which typically has 60% stocks and 40% bonds, he said. However, that could include additional diversification, depending on your risk appetite and goals, experts say. Alternatively, if you're struggling with the latest market drawdowns, you may prefer a more conservative allocation, Baker said. "This is a good time for a temperature check" to make sure your portfolio still matches your risk tolerance, he added.</p>

            <p>In 1994, I went on a date. I had just arrived in a new country and I liked the guy: he seemed funny and confident. He took me to a hardware store (weird, but not a dealbreaker) and then for a Tex-Mex meal during which, at some point, I told him I drove a Land Rover.

It was a truly weird, dumb, lie – I knew nothing about cars and cared even less. Maybe I thought it made me sound grown up, tougher and more capable than I was, or maybe the margaritas went to my head? I’m sure I told him other lies (I remember giving the impression that I enjoyed clubbing), but that one was memorably stupid.</p>

Discussion of security issues in tariff talks not appropriate: Japan PM

TOKYO - Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Sunday that his government will not include discussions on security in its trade talks with the United States, while President Donald Trump has called for reducing the U.S. burden in defending Japan.

"I don't think it is appropriate to discuss security and trade together. We should address security issues without linking them to tariffs," Ishiba said on a TV program, days after his close aide met with Trump and senior U.S. officials on the recently increased levies.</p>

            <p>Google is back in court on Monday for the final phase of a landmark antitrust case that may result in its breakup, a decision that would send shockwaves through the tech world and shake up internet search.

In 2020, the Justice Department, joined by a group of states, accused Google of illegally stifling competition by paying the makers of web browsers and phones to set Google as their default search engine. Last summer, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta agreed, ruling after a 10-week trial that "Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly."
