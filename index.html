          <p>HSBC announced a significant 29% drop in its second-quarter profit before tax, which fell to $6.3 billion, well below the consensus estimate of nearly $7 billion. The European banking giant attributed the disappointing results primarily to impairment charges. This financial performance comes amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly concerning protectionist trade policies, which the bank had previously warned were negatively affecting business and consumer sentiment. As part of a broader restructuring, HSBC is also planning to reduce its investment banking operations outside of Asia and the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves and prompting emergency alerts across the Pacific. Tsunami warnings were issued for Hawaii and parts of Alaska, with advisories for the entire U.S. West Coast, as waves of up to 10 feet were considered possible in some areas. The first waves, measuring about one foot, have already reached Japan's coast, and residents in affected Russian and Hawaiian coastal areas were evacuated to higher ground. The event is one of the strongest earthquakes recorded globally in recent years, causing significant concern for coastal communities.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a three-day hearing to investigate the January midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which resulted in 67 fatalities. The investigation aims to uncover facts about the crash, which is the deadliest U.S. aviation accident since 2001, and has renewed concerns over the congested airspace around Reagan National Airport (DCA). Key areas of focus include potentially malfunctioning helicopter altimeters and missed radio communications. The NTSB's goal is fact-finding to issue safety recommendations, not to assign blame for the incident.</p>

This move exempts these designated zones from Senate Bill 9, a 2021 state law designed to increase housing density by allowing up to four units on single-family lots. The decision follows pressure from Los Angeles officials who raised concerns that a surge in population density in fire-prone areas could severely complicate future emergency evacuations.

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has announced a significant shift in its Middle East policy, stating it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire and a long-term peace plan. Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the goal is to 'affect the situation on the ground' and alleviate suffering by creating a pathway to a two-state solution. The move has drawn criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism, while also receiving mixed reactions from UK opposition parties.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to revoke its 2009 'endangerment finding,' the scientific foundation that classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat and mandates their regulation under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save billions by repealing emissions standards for vehicles and other sources. This decision directly challenges the basis for years of climate regulations, including vehicle fuel efficiency standards that the EPA itself previously estimated would provide trillions in net benefits. Environmental groups have condemned the proposal as a denial of established science and have vowed to challenge it in court.</p>

While the RBA has already cut rates twice this year, it held them steady at its last meeting, preferring to wait for more data.

This has contributed to a significant drop in the yak population, which is crucial for the herders' livelihood, providing everything from milk and wool to fuel.
