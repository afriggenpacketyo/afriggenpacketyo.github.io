        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are causing widespread anxiety among recipients. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office suggests these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans claim the cuts aim to eliminate fraud without affecting coverage, many Medicaid recipients fear losing access to essential healthcare services like nursing home care and medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. The potential work requirements for Medicaid recipients also raise concerns about hindering recovery efforts and access to care for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary on June 14, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday, is projected to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade will feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring coordination with the FAA. Abrams tanks will also be included, with metal plates laid on the streets to prevent damage. While the White House claims the cost will be shared, some Democrats criticize the event as a wasteful display of ego, reminiscent of a previously canceled Veterans Day parade due to high costs.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has cleared Syria’s $15.5 million debt following payments from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, enabling the country to receive grants for reconstruction and economic recovery. This move follows President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria and his meeting with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, signaling a shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. Despite ongoing challenges including infrastructure damage and sectarian violence, there is growing confidence among international investors, highlighted by an $800-million deal with DP World to develop the port of Tartus. The World Bank's initial efforts will focus on expanding access to electricity to spur economic activity.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East was characterized by a focus on securing financial agreements with countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, encompassing investments, arms deals, and Boeing plane purchases. However, the trip was overshadowed by Qatar's gift to Trump of a 747 aircraft to replace Air Force One, a gesture that has drawn criticism from various political factions. The acceptance of the plane raises concerns about violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution and the potential costs of refurbishment and security upgrades. Despite the controversy, Trump's visit avoided public conversations about democracy or human rights, prioritizing transactions over principles.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on whether the Trump administration would consistently adhere to federal court precedent during oral arguments regarding birthright citizenship. Barrett pressed Sauer on the administration's willingness to disregard rulings from lower courts, specifically citing the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' decision on Trump's birthright citizenship order. The exchange sparked debate, with some viewing Barrett's skepticism as a check on executive power, while others criticized her perceived lack of loyalty to the president who appointed her. The court's decision could hinge on the votes of Barrett and Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p>

          <h2>Trump Accuses Comey of Seeking Assassination with Instagram Post</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through an Instagram post featuring the numbers "86 47". Comey had posted a picture of some shells he’d spotted on the beach arranged to spell out “86 47.” The number “86” is a slang term used mostly in bars and restaurants — and also the military — to indicate that something is no longer available or that someone should be removed from the premises, but according to Cassell's Dictionary of Slang, "to 86" can also mean "to kill, to murder; to execute judicially." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed on X that Comey “just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump,” adding that both her department and the Secret Service would now be “investigating this threat” and “respond[ing] appropriately.”</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri led Lando Norris in both Friday practice sessions at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, while Lewis Hamilton faced brake issues after making small changes to his Ferrari. Pirelli's decision to bring the softest three tire compounds to this race could influence strategy due to high tire degradation. The session was interrupted when Isack Hadjar crashed, but he escaped largely undamaged. Lance Stroll, testing Aston Martin's upgrades, felt no significant difference in the car's performance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's foreign policy is not amoral but favors historically anomalous or bad values, aiming to create an immoral world order. While Trump condemns lecturing other countries on democracy, his administration criticizes their internal conduct, as seen in Vice President Vance's remarks on Europe's migration policies. Trump's approach to international dealings is influenced by corruption, as exemplified by Qatar's gift of a Boeing plane, signaling Qatar is one of the good guys, because it does business the Trump way, not the international-liberal-order way. Trump's method is still to sit in judgment over foreign leaders. He simply prefers the bad ones.</p>

Officials for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case. The move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge that is due to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement in which Boeing had agreed to plead guilty.

At a House budget committee hearing today intended to advance the measure one step closer to a floor vote, four Republican members of the far-right Freedom Caucus joined with the Democratic minority to block it from proceeding, arguing the legislation does not make deep enough cuts to federal spending and to programs they dislike. The setback raises the stakes for the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who had set a goal of Memorial Day to get the legislation passed through the House and on to the Senate.</p>

The image shared by Comey — a longtime Trump foe — showed seashells in sand arranged to form the numbers "86 47". He did not make his meaning clear, but administration officials and some of his supporters interpreted the numbers as referring to Mr. Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term "eighty-six," which has often been used to mean "eject" or "remove." He later deleted the image and said he had not meant for the message to be violent.</p>
