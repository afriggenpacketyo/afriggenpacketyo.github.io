          <p>India announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and what it refers to as Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting terrorist infrastructure. The Indian Ministry of Defence stated the actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted, following a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed 26 people last month. Pakistan's Information Minister responded by accusing India of violating Pakistan's territorial sovereignty and attacking its civilian population, leading to heightened tensions and airspace diversions. The United States is monitoring the situation closely, urging both sides toward a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>Morocco is emerging as a crucial hub for Chinese companies seeking to bypass tariffs on exports to Europe, thanks to its free-trade agreement with the European Union. Chinese investment in Morocco's energy and electric vehicle sectors has surged, positioning the country as a key node in the evolving global trading system. However, this has created a delicate balancing act for Morocco, as it must navigate growing tensions between China and the United States to protect its economic and geopolitical interests.

          <p>Poland, once a staunchly pro-American nation, is experiencing renewed anxieties about its security due to President Trump's threats to abandon European security commitments and Russia's aggression. In response, Poland is increasing its military spending, taking a leadership role in the European Union, and organizing civil defense training for its citizens. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has even suggested the possibility of a European nuclear arsenal, signaling a potential shift away from reliance on American protection.

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce that the U.S. will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia. This decision, favored by Arab nations, contrasts with Iran's historical ties to the Persian Gulf. While Trump can change the name for official U.S. purposes, the International Hydrographic Organization aims to ensure uniform naming conventions. This move comes as Trump seeks closer ties with Gulf countries for financial investment and support in regional conflicts.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers suffered a 5-4 extra-innings loss to the Miami Marlins, highlighting concerns about their overworked bullpen. With key relievers having already pitched multiple times on the road trip, manager Dave Roberts was forced to rely on less experienced arms. This decision ultimately led to a walk-off single by JesÃºs Sanchez in the bottom of the 10th inning. The article emphasizes the need for the Dodgers to address their bullpen depth to avoid similar situations in the future.</p>

The State Department advises against travel to Libya due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict. This decision is part of the administration's broader effort to deter illegal immigration and send a message to those in the country illegally.</p>

The meeting, while seemingly friendly, was laden with underlying tensions and awkwardness stemming from Trump's previous remarks and actions. Trump, while attempting to downplay the situation, covered a wide range of unrelated topics, seemingly avoiding the complications his previous statements had created.</p>

The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This could significantly reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia. IB2, a green tech company, signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement the technology.</p>
