          <p>The Syrian government announced the postponement of parliamentary elections in Sweida, Hasaka, and Raqqa provinces, citing the need for a "safe environment." Sweida faces ongoing tensions between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin tribes, while Hasaka and parts of Raqqa are under the control of Kurdish-led forces, who are in a standoff with the central government. This delay comes as the new Islamist government, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, prepares for its first parliamentary vote since toppling Bashar Assad. Critics warn that Sharaa's interim constitution grants him excessive power and fails to represent the country's diverse ethnic and religious groups.</p>

          <p>Anti-corruption protests in Serbia have escalated with increasing reports of police violence and arrests, stemming from a tragic railway station canopy collapse in November 2024 that claimed 16 lives. As a candidate for European Union membership since 2012, Serbia's actions put Brussels under pressure to respond. Critics argue the EU's current appeasement strategy has faltered, influenced by strategic interests such as Serbia's lithium reserves and its friendly relations with Russia. While the EU calls for de-escalation and respect for assembly rights, some observers advocate for economic measures, like conditional funding, to encourage the necessary reforms rather than solely relying on political pressure. The ongoing situation underscores the complex interplay of human rights, economic ties, and geopolitical considerations in the Western Balkans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties across the U.S., including Los Angeles and Chicago. The ruling expands an earlier decision that deemed President Trump's attempt to freeze funds unconstitutional for local governments limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Cities argue these policies are an "abuse of power" and violate the Tenth Amendment, asserting their right to choose not to assist federal immigration enforcement. The administration maintains that sanctuary policies interfere with federal law enforcement and compromise public safety, vowing to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>FBI agents reportedly raided the Bethesda, Maryland, home and Washington D.C. office of former national security adviser John Bolton, allegedly in connection with a probe into classified documents. The New York Post cited a Trump administration official claiming the raid was ordered by FBI Director Kash Patel, linking it to allegations that Bolton sent classified materials to his family via a private email server. President Trump, who revoked Bolton's security clearance in January 2025, expressed disdain for his former adviser, calling him a "lowlife." The incident reignites the feud between Trump and Bolton, who had previously criticized Trump's handling of classified information.</p>

Ash's methods are tested when he assists biotech scientist Sarah, played by Lily James, who is on the run with incriminating documents. The narrative provides a dizzyingly enjoyable cat-and-mouse chase, while also delving into Ash's vulnerabilities as a former failed whistleblower himself.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is at the forefront of global efforts to prevent species extinction, housing over 20 threatened species on its 32,000-acre Northern Virginia campus. Scientists at SCBI study reproduction, ecology, and genetics to breed and reintroduce animals like the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret back into their natural habitats. Despite the critical work, conservation biologists express concern over species vanishing at alarming rates, with 28% of assessed species currently at risk. The institute's success with the black-footed ferret demonstrates the cascading positive effects of saving individual species on entire ecosystems, offering hope for biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Thomas Frank, Tottenham's new manager, has made an impressive start to his Premier League tenure, securing consecutive wins and clean sheets, leading to a mutual "falling in love" with supporters. Appointed after Ange Postecoglou's departure, Frank's impact is particularly noteworthy given widespread discontent over the club's summer transfer dealings and chairman Daniel Levy. Despite limited new signings and key player departures or injuries, Frank's tactical approach has brought defensive solidity while maintaining attacking freedom. His early success, including a standout performance from new loan signing Joao Palhinha against Manchester City, suggests that his appointment might be the club's most significant acquisition this summer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has declared that it will not defend a long-standing federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), asserting that the funding is unconstitutional.

This decision, citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, challenges a program that provides about $350 million annually to over 500 colleges.

          <p>A central Berlin street, formerly known by a name with racist connotations, has been officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse, honoring the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate in 1734. The decision, first announced in 2020, faced legal challenges from residents but was upheld by the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg. The renaming, which coincides with International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, aims to decolonize public spaces and acknowledge Black history. Anton Wilhelm Amo, enslaved as a boy and gifted to a German duke, became a philosopher and legal scholar whose work has largely been erased from European intellectual history.</p>

          <p>Former NBA star Shawn Kemp has been sentenced to 30 days of electronic home monitoring, one year of state supervision, and 240 hours of community service for shooting at two men in a Washington state mall parking lot. Kemp, who pleaded guilty to an assault charge, claimed self-defense, alleging the men provoked the incident by stealing his truck, phone, and memorabilia. The judge agreed with the defense, allowing Kemp to avoid incarceration despite prosecutors recommending a nine-month jail sentence. Kemp expressed his intent to become an advocate against gun violence, particularly among youth, reflecting on the "tough" past three years.</p>

          <p>A colossal landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a powerful tsunami, sending water 1,400 feet up an opposite fjord wall and a 100-foot wave down the inlet, yet miraculously caused no reported casualties. Scientists estimate up to 100 million cubic meters of rock fell, making it one of the largest recorded waves. The incident occurred just hours before tour boats were scheduled to visit the popular tourist destination. Geologists are concerned about increasing landslide risks near retreating glaciers due to climate change, which may "de-buttress" mountainsides and thaw permafrost, highlighting a growing threat of such events in Alaska.</p>

          <p>Experts are cautioning that the surge in retail investor activity within risky exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be a warning sign of an overheating market. Billions of dollars are pouring into niche strategies like single-stock, leveraged, or inverse ETFs, primarily driven by retail investors, with institutional participation largely absent. ETF Action's Mike Akins notes that this product proliferation and flow into volatile, retail-dominated strategies mirror trends seen at previous market tops in 2020-2021. He specifically highlights the risk of yield-focused products, such as covered call ETFs, if underlying stocks falter, suggesting historical parallels indicate a contrarian signal for the broader market.

          <p>An individual planning to retire at 66 after a year's notice is now being asked by their employer to stay on for two months as a part-time consultant to train a replacement. This scenario raises important considerations regarding retirement benefits, particularly Social Security. Collecting benefits while working past full retirement age could temporarily reduce payments if income exceeds a certain cap, though payments are recalculated later. Delaying Social Security claims, even for a few months, can increase future monthly benefits and allow for continued investment of retirement savings. The article advises careful consideration of these financial impacts before accepting such a post-retirement work offer.</p>

          <p>At least 17 major US hospital systems, including Kaiser Permanente and Children's National Hospital, are ending some or all pediatric gender-affirming care services for minors, citing "escalating legal and regulatory risks." This widespread retrenchment follows President Trump's January executive order prohibiting federal funding or support for gender transition for those under 19. While medical organizations support gender-affirming care as beneficial for mental health, some experts question the evidence base and long-term outcomes for minors. Critics argue the administration's actions constitute government overreach, interfering with patient-doctor decisions and creating significant psychosocial setbacks for vulnerable youth.</p>

This decision reverses a previous stance that troops would not carry weapons during their deployment, which now numbers approximately 2,000. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force earlier in August, praised the mission for bringing "total safety" to D.C. However, Washington Mayor Brandon Johnson expressed "grave concerns" about the "unlawful deployment" and its potential to inflame tensions, while polls show the federal intervention is deeply unpopular among city residents.</p>

This frequent activity, characteristic of one of the world's most active volcanoes, is driven by magma flowing into lower and upper chambers before being expelled.
