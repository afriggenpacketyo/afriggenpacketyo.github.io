          <h2>Shenzhen's Export Levels Lag Behind National Growth Amid US Tariff Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 04:59:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen, China's leading exporter, experienced a 2.9% year-on-year drop in exports in April, contrasting with the nation's 8.1% growth. This suggests ongoing vulnerability to trade tensions with the US, according to municipal customs data. Peng Peng, head of the Guangdong Society of Reform, noted Shenzhen's export performance was volatile in the first four months of the year. Shenzhen's economy, heavily reliant on foreign trade, faces unpredictability and limited policy options amidst global trade turbulence. The decline was primarily driven by an 8.3% decrease in general trade, impacting the city's role as China's Silicon Valley, home to tech giants like Huawei and BYD.</p>

          <p>Users of Keir Allan's meet-and-greet parking service at Stansted Airport have reported damage to their vehicles, unexpected mileage, and questionable practices. One customer discovered £6,500 worth of damage to her car after it was involved in a hit-and-run accident 21 miles away, while others reported vandalism and hundreds of extra miles on their odometers. Dashcam footage showed one car parked at a Burger King for over an hour. Essex Trading Standards has received a surge of complaints about airport parking services this year, raising concerns about the industry's regulation and trustworthiness. The British Parking Association advises customers to avoid the cheapest options and calls for government intervention.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is considering renewing an arms embargo on South Sudan, where a flare-up in conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and widespread displacement. Amnesty International warns that lifting the embargo could worsen the human rights situation, citing reports of armed Ugandan soldiers and military equipment deployed in South Sudan. While the embargo has faced enforcement challenges due to porous borders, it has reportedly hindered the deployment of heavy weapons. The UN Security Council recently extended the mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan, expressing deep concern over the deteriorating situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law through its handling of anti-Israel protests since October 2023. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights alleges that Columbia showed "deliberate indifference" toward harassment of Jewish students, violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. HHS claims Columbia failed to protect Jewish students and did not properly address complaints of antisemitism or student misconduct. Columbia is already facing a $400 million cut in federal funding due to allegations of mishandling antisemitism on campus. The university plans to work with the Trump administration to combat antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Sable shearwaters on Lord Howe Island, a remote Australian island, are experiencing unprecedented levels of plastic contamination, with one chick found to have ingested 778 pieces. Scientists from Adrift Lab have been monitoring the birds for nearly two decades, finding increasing amounts of plastic each year. The plastic accumulates in the birds' bodies, causing physical damage and potential dementia-like brain damage. The scientists believe parents are accidentally feeding the plastic to their chicks, mistaking it for food. This alarming trend highlights the growing crisis of plastic pollution in the oceans and its devastating impact on marine life.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa was derailed by Trump's focus on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. Instead of discussing serious issues like tariffs and aid cuts, Trump presented misleading information about land seizures and violence against white farmers. The author argues that Trump was not interested in a productive discussion but rather in scoring points with his base. The incident underscores Trump's tendency to prioritize divisive rhetoric over meaningful diplomacy, potentially damaging international relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump’s moves against higher education, specifically blocking Harvard from enrolling international students, are being viewed in China as a blow to one of the last admirable American institutions. If successful, the hardest-hit group would be students from China, who make up the school’s biggest share of current students from overseas. The move could reshape the broader relationship between the two countries by cutting off one of the few remaining reasons that people in China still admire the United States, with social media reflecting mixed reactions ranging from concern to grim acceptance or even glee.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is preparing to halt the production of pennies following a directive from President Donald Trump, who deemed the coin "so wasteful." The decision is expected to save the US Treasury $56 million annually in material costs. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny has been a staple since 1792, with around 114 billion currently in circulation. Advocates for eliminating the penny cite its high production cost and limited utility, while others argue for its usefulness in charity drives. Congress must legislate that prices be rounded up in order to eliminate demand for the coin.</p>
