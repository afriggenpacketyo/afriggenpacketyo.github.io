            <p>Ukraine has sanctioned three Chinese companies accused of involvement in producing advanced Iskander missiles for Russia, a move that follows President Zelensky's claims of Chinese weapon supplies to Russia, which China denies. The sanctioned entities, registered in China, are Beijing Aviation And Aerospace Xianghui Technology, Rui Jin Machinery, and Zhongfu Shenying Carbon Fiber Xining. Zelensky stated these companies contributed to the production of Iskander missiles, which Russia has been using to strike Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv. The sanctions include barring the companies from doing business with Ukraine and freezing any assets within the country, escalating tensions between Kyiv and Beijing.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to fire approximately 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), ordering a halt to the Reduction In Force (RIF) after concerns arose about potential violations of a previous court order. Judge Amy Berman Jackson expressed "deep concern" over the rushed implementation of the RIF, questioning whether the Trump administration deliberately violated the injunction. She has ordered a hearing and requested communications between key officials to determine if the terminations were carried out after "particularized assessments" of individual employee performance, as the injunction required.</p>

            <p>The United States is experiencing a significant surge in measles cases, reaching levels not seen since 2019, with a majority of infections stemming from an outbreak in West Texas that has resulted in two fatalities. Nationwide, the number of cases has climbed to 800, affecting at least 24 states. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to declining vaccination rates, with the percentage of kindergarteners vaccinated against measles falling below the critical threshold needed for community immunity. Despite concerns, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has voiced support for the measles vaccine, urging people to get vaccinated while opposing government mandates.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced new fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, following an investigation that found China's shipbuilding practices to be unreasonable and restrictive to U.S. commerce. The fees, which will be charged per voyage, aim to address China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry. The policy allows for remission of fees if ship owners provide proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order. China's commerce ministry has criticized the U.S. action, and the World Shipping Council has expressed concerns over the potential harm to U.S. consumers and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status, prompting debate over the use of the IRS's authority. The rationale stems from a 1983 Supreme Court decision, Bob Jones University v. United States, which allows the IRS to deny tax exemptions to organizations whose activities are contrary to settled public policy. Conservatives should be wary of expanding this authority, as it could lead to potential reprisals and conflicts with principles of free association and religious liberty. Furthermore, textualists argue that aligning the tax code with national policy goals is Congress's job, not the executive branch's.</p>

The closure reflects a broader trend of rising rents forcing out unique, local businesses and replacing them with chain stores, threatening the character of neighborhoods like Silver Lake. The loss of such businesses raises questions about why people would choose to live in these neighborhoods if they lose their unique appeal.</p>

            <p>A 3-year-old girl in Mexico has died after contracting the H5N1 bird flu virus, according to the World Health Organization.

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly planning to end most of its routine food safety inspections and outsource the oversight to state and local authorities. The plans are not finalized and may require congressional action for funding. Some FDA employees have been working on this shift for years, as it could free up resources for higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with states.</p>

The sanctions target an aeronautics firm and two industrial component companies, restricting their business activities in Ukraine and freezing any assets within the country. Tensions between Kyiv and Beijing have been escalating, with Zelensky previously accusing China of hindering participation in a peace conference in Switzerland.
