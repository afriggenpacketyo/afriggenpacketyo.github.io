          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to cut $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding for USAID and the State Department, using a controversial process known as a "pocket rescission." This move has drawn bipartisan criticism from Congress, with lawmakers arguing it illegally sidesteps their authority over federal spending. The article also touches on other administration news, including French President Macron's comments regarding a potential meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. Additionally, it notes a meeting between President Trump and the Smithsonian Secretary amid White House pressure on the museum's content.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing intense criticism and calls for his resignation following a week of turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kennedy made several controversial statements, including suggesting a link between psychiatric drugs and school shootings and claiming he could identify children with "mitochondrial challenges" by sight. These remarks come as the CDC experiences a leadership crisis, with top officials resigning in protest of the administration's actions. A former CDC director also revealed that Kennedy has not been briefed by the agency's experts on key public health issues.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been eliminated from the US Open after a decisive 6-1, 6-2 loss to ninth seed Elena Rybakina. Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, dominated the match with powerful serves and returns, breaking Raducanu's serve four times. Despite entering the tournament with renewed optimism and strong early-round performances, Raducanu was unable to counter her opponent's aggressive play. The defeat highlights Raducanu's ongoing challenge against top-10 players and ends her run at the tournament where she famously won the title in 2021.</p>

          <p>Tesla is appealing a $242.5 million verdict related to a 2019 fatal crash in Florida involving its Enhanced Autopilot system. The company's lawyers have filed a motion asking for the verdict to be dismissed or for a new trial, arguing that the driver was entirely at fault and that the vehicle had no design defects. The crash occurred when the driver, distracted while trying to retrieve his phone, accelerated through an intersection, killing one person and severely injuring another. Plaintiffs' counsel maintains that the jury correctly found shared responsibility due to Tesla's misrepresentations of its Autopilot capabilities.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders commented on a surprising and consistent aspect of home games at Folsom Field: the distinct smell of marijuana. In an interview, Sanders noted that the scent becomes particularly noticeable during a TV timeout in the second quarter of every game. He humorously referred to it as the "light-up" quarter. Sanders, who is entering his third season as coach, stated that he has never been high and finds the recurring phenomenon new to him. The Buffaloes are set to open their season at home against Georgia Tech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge heard arguments regarding President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her post over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook's lawyers are seeking a temporary restraining order, arguing the firing is an unlawful attack on the central bank's independence and violates the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" removal standard. Justice Department attorneys defended the president's authority, stating that courts cannot second-guess his judgment on what constitutes cause for removing a senior financial regulator. The judge did not issue an immediate ruling, noting the case raises important questions about presidential power and the Fed's autonomy.</p>

          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, high-value ranches are being listed for sale as heirs find it difficult to manage the properties or prefer to cash out their inheritance. Brokers report a surge in inventory of these legacy properties, driven by family disagreements and a lack of interest from younger generations in ranching. Demand remains strong from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, who seek privacy and a rural lifestyle. While selling provides a financial windfall, it also marks the end of a family's long-held connection to the land and a unique way of life.</p>

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority in ending the protections. The court noted that Congress designed the TPS system to be dependable and insulated from political shifts.

          <p>The era of inexpensive international online shopping for Americans is changing as the Trump administration ends the "de minimis" exemption for all countries. This loophole allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties, a key factor in the business models of e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. The policy change means many imported goods will become more expensive due to new taxes, potentially take longer to arrive because of customs backlogs, or become unavailable to U.S. buyers. While this may curb mindless consumerism, it will also impact the accessibility of unique and affordable goods from global sellers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines the Trump administration's use of the phrase "No one is above the law" when launching investigations into political opponents. The author argues this is a disingenuous retort to the investigations Trump himself faced, and contrasts the Biden administration's appointment of a special counsel with Trump's installation of loyalists at the Justice Department. The piece contends that the idea of using the law against political rivals was introduced by Trump in 2016, not by Democrats. It concludes that Trump's extensive history of legal issues is the primary reason he became the first ex-president to face criminal investigation.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details recent breakthroughs in understanding and treating chronic pain. The book highlights a shift in research toward a "bedside-to-bench" approach, where scientists study patients' real-world experiences to identify objective biomarkers for pain in the brain. This has led to groundbreaking trials using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to predict and intercept pain signals before they are felt. While not yet widely available, this research demonstrates that the brain's pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering hope for new, non-surgical therapies.</p>

          <h2>UK Bank Stocks Fall Amid Calls for New Windfall Tax on Profits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Share prices for major UK banks like NatWest and Lloyds dropped significantly following a proposal for a new windfall tax on the sector's profits. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank suggested the tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to offset taxpayer losses from the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The IPPR argues that the program's design has resulted in a multi-billion-pound subsidy to commercial banks. Financial industry groups oppose the idea, warning that another tax would harm the UK's international competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Detainees at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration facility in Florida have alleged that guards used tear gas and batons to suppress a recent uprising. In phone calls to a news outlet, several men claimed they were indiscriminately beaten after a group began chanting for freedom. The Florida Division of Emergency Management, which operates the jail, has denied the reports, calling them "manufactured." The allegations come as the remote tent camp faces a court order to close within 60 days due to environmental law breaches, and authorities are working to transfer the individuals held there.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with President Trump was marked by apparent personal chemistry, easing fears of a contentious meeting. Lee's preparations, which included studying Trump's book "The Art of the Deal," seemed to pay off as key proposals, like a plan to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding, were received favorably. However, analysts caution that it is too early to declare the summit a definitive success. Several major issues, including trade details, defense cost-sharing, and the potential relocation of U.S. troops, remain unresolved and will be subject to further negotiations.</p>

          <p>This editorial uses President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook as a lens to examine the concept of central bank independence. The author argues that defending the Fed's independence should not be confused with defending democracy itself, as the institution is not free from political influence, particularly from business elites. The piece suggests that the neoliberal era's emphasis on independence primarily served financial interests rather than ensuring technocratic efficiency. It concludes that while Trump's actions must be condemned, the situation should prompt a deeper conversation about what a more genuinely democratic and accountable central bank would look like.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the United States is steadily moving toward authoritarianism under President Trump's leadership. The author points to the deployment of the National Guard in cities, raids on political opponents' homes, and the use of federal agencies to investigate critics as clear evidence. The piece contends that Trump's actions, including his attempt to remove a Federal Reserve governor and push for partisan redistricting, are aimed at consolidating power and neutralizing any institution that could act as a check on his authority. The author warns that these moves are often too blatant to be taken seriously, but represent a genuine danger to American democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are seeking debt relief. This article outlines the qualification requirements for several common options. Traditional debt consolidation loans typically require a credit score above 650 and a manageable debt-to-income ratio. Debt forgiveness programs are for those facing severe financial hardship with significant unsecured debt, while debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies require enough income to meet a structured repayment schedule. Other options include internal hardship programs from credit card issuers and, in extreme cases, bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, its highest level since February. This increase suggests that President Trump's tariffs are contributing to higher prices within the U.S. economy. Despite inflation remaining well above the Fed's 2% target, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting, with officials focused on signs of a weakening labor market. The report also showed that consumer spending and personal income both increased, indicating underlying economic strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen infrastructure projects designed to support the offshore wind industry. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the funds were for "wasteful" projects and would be redirected to other maritime industry needs. The largest affected project is the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind marine terminal in California, which lost about $427 million in support. This move is the latest in the Trump administration's escalating campaign against renewable energy development, following a recent order to halt work on a nearly completed wind project off the New England coast.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential returns for savers considering a $30,000 certificate of deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment. Based on today's rates, such a deposit could earn anywhere from over $300 on a 3-month term to more than $6,700 on a 5-year term. The primary benefit of a CD is its fixed interest rate, which protects savings from future rate cuts and provides predictable growth. However, this comes with a trade-off, as funds are locked in for the duration of the term, unlike more flexible options like high-yield savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

The redistricting, which was pushed by former President Trump, has drawn sharp condemnation from Democrats and civil rights groups who argue it is a gerrymander designed to disenfranchise voters of color. The new map redraws districts in major Democratic-leaning urban areas like Houston, Austin, and Dallas.
