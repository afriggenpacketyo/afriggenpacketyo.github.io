NASA and his family honored his legacy, highlighting his critical role in safely returning the Apollo 13 crew to Earth after an in-flight explosion. Lovell was a four-time spaceflight veteran, also serving on the Apollo 8 mission, which was the first to orbit the Moon.

          <p>Fast-food chain Wendy's has reduced its annual sales forecast, citing a challenging economic climate and increased competition that are impacting consumer spending. Executives noted that lower-income customers are particularly pulling back, with breakfast sales showing a significant decline as people choose to eat at home more often. The company is struggling to attract these price-conscious consumers, unlike competitors such as McDonald's, which have successfully used value-menu promotions to boost sales. Wendy's is now considering new data analytics to re-evaluate its pricing strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The suspect accused of killing four people in a shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been captured following a weeklong manhunt. Authorities identified the suspect as Michael Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran who lived next door to the bar and reportedly struggled with mental health issues. The attack was described by the state's attorney general as a cold-blooded act with no apparent reason. The capture brings a resolution to the search, though the community continues to mourn the loss of the four victims, who were remembered as great people.</p>

          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, mistakenly identified a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as potential illegal migrants, prompting an alert to authorities. He posted on social media demanding mass deportations before it was revealed the boat contained a crew raising money for motor neurone disease research. The rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident hilarious. After learning of his error, the MP, who has been a vocal critic of illegal immigration, pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has voided a lower court's criminal contempt order against Trump administration officials regarding the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case originated when a district judge found officials had willfully disregarded his order to halt the removal of migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, ruled in favor of the administration, noting the planes were already outside U.S. airspace when the order was issued. This decision marks a significant legal victory for the administration in its ongoing clashes with the judiciary over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed all federal agencies to delete records of employee COVID-19 vaccination status, noncompliance with past mandates, and exemption requests. Issued by the Office of Personnel Management, the guidance is framed as a reversal of 'harmful pandemic-era policies' from the previous administration. Agencies are now prohibited from using an individual's vaccination history in any employment decisions and must remove the data from personnel files unless an employee opts out. This move follows the 2023 repeal of the federal employee vaccine mandate, which had faced numerous legal challenges.</p>

This stance is maintained despite the Trump administration's increasing pressure on Mexico to curb fentanyl trafficking, including the imposition of tariffs.</p>

In response, authorities are deploying extensive measures reminiscent of COVID-19 tactics, including fogging streets with insecticide and isolating those who test positive. Because the Chinese population has little to no immunity to the virus, which is typically found in other parts of the world, these aggressive measures are being taken to prevent its further spread.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ad-tech company The Trade Desk saw its stock plummet by 39% for its worst day on record. The sharp decline was triggered by the unexpected announcement of its CFO's departure and growing investor concerns about increased competition from Amazon's expanding advertising business. While the company's quarterly earnings and revenue beat expectations, analysts expressed unease about the leadership change and the potential for Amazon's demand-side platform to erode The Trade Desk's market position. The company's forecast also noted potential headwinds from tariffs, further unsettling investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old Florida woman has been arrested for allegedly posing as a licensed nurse and providing medical care to thousands of patients.

          <p>Legal professionals are expressing growing alarm over the tactic of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) making arrests at criminal courthouses. Lawyers and prosecutors report that this practice is creating a 'chilling effect,' deterring not only undocumented defendants but also victims and witnesses from appearing in court for fear of deportation. This fear can undermine the judicial process by pressuring defendants into plea deals and preventing victims from testifying or seeking protective orders. The article suggests this trend obstructs justice and erodes the immigrant community's trust in the legal system.</p>

          <p>An ethics watchdog group has requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747 jet from the Qatari royal family on behalf of President Trump. The group, Democracy Defenders Fund, alleges that the Department of Defense may have broken laws and improperly used its authority to accept the gift. The memo raises concerns that critical defense funds are being diverted to retrofit the plane, which the group argues is a redundant and unnecessary expense. This move questions the legality and ethics of a foreign government providing such a high-value gift to a sitting president.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered that Blake Lively's deposition in her sexual harassment lawsuit against director Justin Baldoni be removed from the public court record. The judge sharply criticized Baldoni's legal team for attaching the entire 300-page transcript to a filing when they only cited two pages, calling it an attempt to 'invite public speculation and scandal.' This ruling is a procedural victory for Lively, whose lawyers had accused the opposing counsel of using the deposition for their own public relations purposes. The judge has not yet ruled on a separate request for sanctions against Baldoni's lawyer.</p>

          <p>Shares of salad chain Sweetgreen dropped 23% after the company cut its 2025 financial outlook for the second time in two quarters. The company cited a combination of factors for the downgrade, including challenges with its new loyalty program, weaker consumer sentiment, and the impact of tariffs. Sweetgreen now anticipates negative same-store sales for the full year and a lower profit margin. The CEO described the recent quarter as 'really, really rough,' acknowledging both external headwinds and internal operational issues that the company is now focused on improving.

Drawing on insights from bestselling author Kelly Corrigan, it suggests that short breaks for walking, dancing, or just moving around can effectively reset mood and focus. Rather than forcing productivity during low-energy periods, the piece advocates for working with the body's natural rhythms. These small actions, from a three-minute dance break to tidying a workspace, are presented as integral parts of the creative process, not distractions from it.</p>

          <p>Israel is facing widespread international criticism after its security cabinet approved a plan to expand its war in Gaza by taking full control of Gaza City. World leaders from the UN, UK, France, and Canada have condemned the move, warning it will lead to more bloodshed and a worsening humanitarian catastrophe, with Germany halting military exports in response. Despite the backlash, Israeli officials remain defiant, stating that international pressure will not weaken their resolve.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some economists are warning that President Trump's new, sweeping tariffs on trade partners could push the U.S. economy toward stagflation, a difficult combination of high inflation and low economic growth. The concern is that businesses will pass the costs of the import duties on to consumers, fueling inflation, while also potentially scaling back hiring and investment, which would slow growth. While the White House has dismissed these fears, recent economic data shows inflation inching up and the job market showing signs of weakness, creating a challenging scenario for policymakers at the Federal Reserve.

He required 20 stitches for a leg wound and also sustained bites to his head and neck. The incident was partially captured on video by another parent at the game. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is investigating the attack, noting that while coyotes typically avoid humans, they can become conditioned to human presence.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary 'Chimp Crazy,' has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison. Her conviction stems from lying to a court that a chimpanzee named Tonka, who she was accused of mistreating, had died. In reality, she was hiding the primate in her basement to prevent his transfer to a sanctuary, an act she later admitted to in the documentary. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice, with prosecutors noting her lack of remorse and continued defiance of court orders.</p>
