          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings dropped significantly after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard retracted its $47 billion acquisition offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i, which had previously rejected the bid as undervaluing the company. Analysts suggest that Japanese protectionism and the classification of Seven & i as a nationally important company made the deal highly unlikely from the start. (not investment advice)</p>

He met with children being educated on mine avoidance and highlighted the ongoing danger that remnants of war pose to civilians. The visit underscored the progress made since his mother's advocacy, as a former minefield she walked through is now a thriving community with a school.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year, contrary to economists' expectations of a rise. The decline is driven by reduced shipments to major partners like China and the U.S., with auto exports to the U.S. falling sharply under a new 25% tariff. Analysts warn that these ongoing trade disputes and tariffs could push Japan's export-reliant economy into a technical recession, as carmakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs.

          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes, addressing a gap left by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The legislation will allow veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move those missed payments to the end of their loan term, a common option unavailable to them after a previous VA program was abruptly ended. This long-awaited fix provides a crucial safety net and has been praised by mortgage industry and veterans' advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son who were lost in a remote California forest were successfully located by rescuers who followed a trail of notes she left behind. The pair became stranded after their car's GPS led them onto remote roads where they lost signal. The notes, along with the son's use of a whistle to signal for help, guided the search team to their location. Authorities praised the mother for her resourcefulness and for notifying someone of their travel plans beforehand.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for terminating a major FEMA program that funds pre-disaster mitigation projects. The lawsuit argues that the executive branch acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision that rests with Congress. The states claim the cuts jeopardize critical infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters and will cause irreversible harm if already-approved funds are reallocated.</p>

Experts warn that losing these services could increase health risks like dementia and heart disease, which are linked to loneliness, and potentially overwhelm institutional care facilities if these community-based support systems are dismantled.</p>

Former and current officials, including the fired USAID inspector general, state that the administration has provided little to no proof for these claims. Critics allege the cuts were politically motivated, targeting programs related to gender, climate, and family planning, rather than being based on a thorough review of program effectiveness or actual fraudulent activity.</p>

The unraveling of this industry, which produces clothing for major U.S. brands, has led to factory closures and the loss of thousands of jobs, devastating the small country's workforce.</p>
