          <p>Donald Trump is pushing for American commercial and military vessels to traverse the Panama and Suez Canals without charge, directing his secretary of state to prioritize this initiative. He claims the canals owe their existence to the U.S. The Panamanian president countered that canal fees are managed by an autonomous body. Egypt reported a 60% revenue drop in 2024 due to Houthi attacks disrupting Suez Canal traffic, while the U.S. military continues strikes on Houthi positions to ensure maritime safety.
