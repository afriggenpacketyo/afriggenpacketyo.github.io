          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 3.5%. This growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the strong performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintained a cautious outlook, citing significant global economic uncertainty and potential impacts from U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to downside risks, but this robust GDP data may influence its upcoming decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 37 people have been killed and approximately 50 wounded in southern Syria following violent clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and the local Druze community. The conflict, which erupted in the city of Sweida, reportedly began after a series of kidnappings. This event marks the deadliest sectarian violence in the region since the new government took power, highlighting the ongoing struggle to maintain security and protect minority groups in the deeply divided country. Authorities have deployed security forces and closed a major highway in response.</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by strengthening its defense and maritime cooperation with the Philippines while managing its crucial trade relationship with China. As part of a broader civil maritime program, Australia recently donated patrol boats to the Philippine Coast Guard and plans to double its investment in related initiatives to A$11.5 million. This strategic partnership enhancement comes as both nations prepare to celebrate 80 years of diplomatic relations, reflecting a shared motivation to bolster regional security amidst rising tensions.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing technology and engineering-related majors over previously popular subjects like international trade. This trend is heavily influenced by China's state-driven focus on achieving technological self-sufficiency amid intensified competition with the United States. Fields such as information and communications technology and vehicle engineering are now top choices, as they are seen as crucial for the nation's future industrial development. This reflects a strategic funneling of talent into areas deemed vital for national progress.</p>

          <p>Drake's headline performance on the final night of London's Wireless Festival ended abruptly after just 40 minutes, leaving many fans feeling disappointed. The rapper appeared on stage early and referenced the venue's strict curfew, promising to play until his microphone was cut off. The shortened set, which featured fewer special guests than previous nights, concluded with Drake waving to the crowd from a crane. Attendees expressed frustration, with some noting they spent more time queuing to enter the festival than they did watching the headline act perform.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner, 23, has won the Wimbledon men's singles championship, becoming the first Italian player to ever secure a singles title at the prestigious tournament. The world's top-ranked player defeated two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a hard-fought final, coming back to win after losing the first set. This victory was a form of redemption for Sinner, who had lost a grueling five-set match to Alcaraz at the French Open just over a month ago.

          <p>A Senate committee report has concluded that the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump was preceded by a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service. The investigation found that a lack of structured communication was the greatest contributor, as critical information about the shooter was not disseminated effectively to the security detail. The report also identified organizational mistakes, such as a countersniper team having an obstructed view, and accused the former Secret Service director of falsely testifying to Congress about resource allocation for the rally.</p>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer made the case for divorcing personal political feelings about President Trump from investment decisions. He argued that despite widespread institutional selling and personal dislike for the president's demeanor, the market has been resilient, driven by individual investors. Cramer posited that a combination of a pro-capitalist agency environment, deregulation, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence is creating a positive backdrop for stocks, regardless of the president's controversial tariff policies or behavior.
