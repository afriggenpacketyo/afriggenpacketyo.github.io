            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed concerns regarding his use of Signal to discuss military actions, specifically an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, in a chat that included his wife and brother. Hegseth downplayed the reports as "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees, emphasizing his continued alignment with President Trump. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Hegseth, asserting the president's strong support and highlighting Hegseth's efforts to address leaks within the Pentagon.

Cardinal Vincent Nichols and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell also paid tribute, highlighting the Pope's advocacy for human dignity and his efforts to combat climate change. Pope Francis was known for his progressive stances, including allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, while also maintaining traditional views on issues like abortion.</p>

            <p>A survey by Renmin University's International Monetary Institute indicates that enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, reflecting concerns about the safety and credibility of US assets. Economists suggest that the weakening dominance of the US dollar, exacerbated by policies from the Trump administration, is creating opportunities for the yuan's internationalization. The survey reveals a growing percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements, with a significant portion using the currency for cross-border trade and foreign exchange trading. Recent volatility in the US Treasury market has further fueled this trend, with global capital not flowing to the US as it has in the past.</p>

            <p>The death of Pope Francis initiates a series of traditional rituals and processes, including a conclave to elect his successor. The Cardinal Camerlengo formally pronounces the Pope's death, breaks the Fisherman's ring, and seals the papal apartment. A nine-day mourning period, called Novemdiales, follows, with Vatican flags flown at half-staff and the Pope's funeral taking place within four to six days. Cardinals from around the world gather in Rome to discuss the future direction of the Church before the conclave begins, where Cardinal Electors will cast ballots until a new pope is chosen.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point, driven by widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. The survey indicates a decline in economic optimism since Trump's election, with more Americans now anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents express significant disapproval of his economic policies. Tariffs are a major source of public discontent, with a majority believing they negatively impact American workers, inflation, and the overall economy.</p>
