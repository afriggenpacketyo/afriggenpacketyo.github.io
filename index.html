          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist and conservationist, has passed away at the age of 91, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy that profoundly impacted our understanding of the natural world. Her pioneering research in Tanzania, which began in 1960, revolutionized scientific understanding of chimpanzees, demonstrating their tool-use and complex social behaviors previously thought unique to humans. Beyond her groundbreaking scientific contributions, Goodall became a tireless global advocate for animal welfare and environmental protection, inspiring countless individuals and organizations to join the fight against habitat devastation and climate change. Her work significantly shaped evolutionary science and ignited a global movement to safeguard the natural world, with her Jane Goodall Institute continuing to champion these critical causes for future generations.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle collided with a disabled semi-truck obstructing the track near Lompoc, California, resulting in four injuries and a significant environmental hazard. The incident, which occurred with 218 passengers and crew on board, led to the truck driver sustaining major injuries, while three train passengers suffered minor injuries. Critically, the impact caused the semi-truck to spill approximately 3,600 gallons of diesel fuel, necessitating the closure of Highway 1 between Main Street and Brown Road. Amtrak police are now cooperating with local law enforcement to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of this serious transportation accident and address the ongoing environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are adapting to unprecedented surges in gold prices, particularly affecting demand for traditional wedding jewellery. Global gold prices have soared by over 48% this year, hitting a record high of US$3,883 per ounce, building on a substantial 26% gain from the previous year. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook observe that despite these dramatic increases, consumers have gradually adjusted to the elevated costs, prioritizing cultural traditions such as buying gold dragon and phoenix bracelets for weddings. This article highlights how market dynamics and deeply ingrained cultural practices interact, influencing consumer spending in a high-value sector.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in 'Breaking Bad,' will not face criminal charges following a parking dispute last month, according to the Los Angeles city attorney’s office. Cruz had been held in police custody for five hours after three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water while he was washing his car. His agent maintained that Cruz had merely asked the women to move their vehicle to prevent them from getting wet and that any water splash was unintentional, occurring as they began to record him. The decision by prosecutors marks the resolution of this minor but publicly reported incident involving the actor.</p>

Israel's Foreign Ministry stated the vessels were "safely stopped" for approaching an "active combat zone," while the GSF condemned the interception as "illegal" and a "brazen act of desperation" to maintain Gaza's isolation. Colombia responded by expelling Israeli diplomats and terminating a free trade agreement, highlighting international condemnation and concerns over the legality of the naval blockade and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The incident intensifies global scrutiny on aid access to the war-torn Palestinian territory.</p>

          <p>Portland police are seeking public assistance to locate a woman accused of assault near the city's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building, after a "dialogue liaison officer" (DLO) lost track of her. The DLO, a sworn officer assigned to "hold a safe space" for protesters, attempted to detain the suspect, who allegedly refused the lawful police order and fled the scene. This incident underscores the complexities and limitations of Portland's DLO program, which was implemented after the 2020 protests to foster relationships with demonstrators while restricting officers from direct enforcement actions. The case has now been transferred to a detective in the Major Crimes Unit for further investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has entered a shutdown after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on extending government funding, stemming from weeks of entrenched partisan disagreements. This article provides essential context by explaining the constitutional process for government funding and how legislative stalemates often arise when the minority party leverages its position for concessions. The current impasse is primarily driven by Democrats' insistence on including negotiations over expiring healthcare tax credits in a funding measure, which Republicans have resisted. The shutdown has resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal workers being furloughed without pay, underscoring the significant economic and political costs of legislative gridlock and deep political divisions.</p>

          <p>Huntington Beach, California, has declared itself a "non-sanctuary" city, actively challenging California's statewide "sanctuary" policies that restrict local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Mayor Pat Burns, a staunch supporter of President Trump, championed the unanimous council initiative, asserting that the city's residents are negatively impacted by illegal immigration and that law enforcement should be allowed to fully collaborate. While California's sanctuary status generally limits local police assistance to ICE, Huntington Beach's action serves as a significant symbolic statement and an encouragement for other cities to adopt similar non-sanctuary approaches. This article highlights the persistent tension and ideological divide between state and local governments regarding immigration policy and enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>An attorney alleges that the U.S. government unlawfully deported two of his clients, who were asylum seekers, to Iran without due process, thereby placing them at severe risk of persecution in their home country. Ali Herischi stated that his clients, one of whom is a Christian convert, "disappeared" from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainee locator system before being deported without prior notice. One client's wife, who recently gave birth, remains in the U.S., while her husband was reportedly "shackled and handcuffed all the way to Iran."

          <p>Five years after its robotaxi debut on U.S. streets, Waymo, Google's autonomous vehicle company, is still working through operational issues with its driverless cars. A recent incident captured on video showed a Waymo vehicle in Atlanta blowing past a stopped school bus with its red lights flashing, an action that would result in a significant fine for a human driver. While Waymo is investigating the incident and claims its own safety data indicates fewer serious injury crashes compared to human drivers, transportation safety experts emphasize that self-driving vehicles must be held to an even higher standard. This article highlights the ongoing challenges, learning curve, and public scrutiny faced by autonomous technology as it expands into more urban areas.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted an inventive, silent protest during a press conference after fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the team's starting position. Sanders, a former college star playing for his father Deion Sanders, responded to reporters' questions by moving his mouth and gesturing but emitting no actual words, effectively "muting" himself. This unusual and brilliant response is believed to be a reaction to critical remarks made by former NFL coach and current analyst Rex Ryan, who had taken issue with Sanders' previous comments about his capabilities as a backup quarterback.

Pike, now 49, was just 18 when she brutally murdered 19-year-old Colleen Slemmer in 1995, an act for which she later bragged and showed off a piece of the victim's skull. Her attorneys argue that her young age and previously undiagnosed mental health struggles at the time should preclude the death penalty, advocating for life in prison without the possibility of parole.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to closely examine the market's third-quarter winners, suggesting that while many of these top performers could continue to rally through the end of the year, the "biggest gains may, indeed, have already been made." He explained that fund managers often acquire these successful stocks in the fourth quarter to demonstrate strong portfolio performance to clients. Cramer highlighted several key Q3 successes, including AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, Warner Bros. Discovery, Teradyne, Intel, and Invesco, attributing their substantial gains to factors such as surging AI demand, significant balance sheet improvements, and strategic corporate partnerships.

          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils, offering guidance on healthier choices for frying and general use. Professor Nita Forouhi of Cambridge University clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils, despite bad press, are beneficial due to low saturated fats and high mono/polyunsaturated fats, making them "absolutely good for us." She also notes that modern margarines are healthy, containing near-zero trans fats. Forouhi advises that while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil or vegetable/sunflower oil is suitable for shallow or deep frying, respectively. The article provides practical, evidence-based advice for consumers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has dramatically increased its drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in recent months, leading to significant fuel shortages and price hikes across various parts of Russia. An analysis by BBC Verify and BBC Russian reveals that 21 of Russia's 38 large refineries have been targeted since January, with strikes reaching record levels in August and remaining high in September. These attacks, some occurring deep within Russian territory, are a deliberate strategy by Ukraine to damage Russia's oil industry and exert pressure for negotiations, as stated by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The impact is visibly manifested in long queues at petrol stations and rationing in occupied Crimea, indicating a tangible effect on both civilian life and Russia's war economy.</p>

However, widespread public revulsion at their actions appears to have prompted a rare backtrack, with the hackers stating, "We are sorry for hurting kids."
