          <p>An analysis examines President Trump's new Religious Liberty Commission and its departure from traditional religious right agendas. The commission, dominated by evangelicals and conservative members of other faiths, prioritizes American nationalism over traditional religious values. This shift mirrors Soviet Russia's model, where the church serves the state's interests rather than the other way around. The article suggests that this new movement seeks to reshape America in unprecedented ways, and combating it requires understanding its unique ideological and practical aims.</p>

The changes aim to soften the impact of the cuts, which include making it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). Protections include a 13-week transitional Pip payment, continued carer's allowance, and extra income support for those with severe health conditions.
