          <p>A powerful explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems facility in Tennessee has resulted in multiple fatalities, with several people remaining unaccounted for. The blast, which was felt miles away, has prompted a major response from emergency services, though continuing small detonations have hampered access to the site. The cause of the "devastating" explosion is currently unknown and under investigation, and the company, which produces explosives for military and commercial use, is cooperating with authorities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun the process of laying off federal workers, referred to as "Reductions in Force" (RIFs), as the government shutdown continues into its tenth day. The Office of Management and Budget confirmed the layoffs are "substantial," with the Department of Health and Human Services being one of the first affected agencies. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who accuse the administration of creating deliberate chaos, while unions have filed lawsuits in response.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to withdraw from a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and impose a "massive" increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. The threat comes in response to Beijing's new export controls on rare earth minerals, which are critical for manufacturing high-tech products like semiconductors and defense weapons. This escalation has renewed fears of a trade war between the two economic giants, causing financial markets to drop significantly amid the uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A new peace deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the U.S., has highlighted Turkey's significant diplomatic role in the negotiations. Turkish President Erdoğan, at President Trump's request, reportedly used his country's close relationship with Hamas to help persuade the group to agree to the terms. As part of the implementation, Turkey may contribute to a multinational task force in Gaza, potentially assisting in locating the remains of Israeli hostages, though the deployment of Turkish troops would require parliamentary approval.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has secured an agreement with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to lower drug prices for U.S. consumers, following a similar deal made with Pfizer. The arrangement will involve AstraZeneca selling drugs directly to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations through a new government website. This initiative is part of President Trump's broader effort to pressure drugmakers to reduce costs and increase manufacturing within the United States, using the threat of tariffs as leverage.</p>

However, other important data releases, such as the nonfarm payroll report, remain postponed due to the lapse in government funding.</p>

While Ingrassia's lawyer denies the claims and an internal investigation reportedly cleared him, the accusation has surfaced amid scrutiny of his controversial nomination to the independent federal watchdog agency.</p>

Its record-breaking success is attributed to a massive built-in audience from the fan fiction community and the growing popularity of the "romantasy" and "dark romance" genres, which have dominated publishing recently.</p>
