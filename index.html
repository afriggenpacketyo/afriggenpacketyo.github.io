          <p>A 42-year-old man is facing potential terrorism charges after allegedly stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The suspect, identified as Bradford James Gille, was apprehended by a deputy with the help of armed citizens who confronted him in the parking lot. The victims, ranging in age from 21 to 84, were taken to a local hospital, with their conditions reportedly improving since the attack. The FBI is assisting local law enforcement in the investigation to determine a motive for what appears to be a random act of violence.</p>

          <p>Despite significant media attention and criticism from some conservative figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters in middle America appear unfazed by the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews conducted in states like Pennsylvania and Tennessee reveal a strong sense of loyalty, with many voters dismissing the issue as a politically motivated distraction by Democrats. These supporters prioritize what they see as Trump's policy achievements, such as a strong economy and border security. This sentiment highlights a complex and divided reaction within the Republican base regarding the ongoing scandal.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, averting a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than previously threatened but higher than the EU had hoped for. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making an additional $600 billion in investments. While some products like pharmaceuticals are exempt, the deal aims to rebalance the trade relationship and bring stability.</p>

          <p>UBTech has unveiled a new humanoid robot, the Walker S2, with the ability to autonomously swap its own battery, enabling it to work nearly 24/7 without human intervention. When its power is low, the robot proceeds to a charging station, removes the depleted battery, and inserts a fresh one in a process that takes about three minutes. Designed for factory automation, the 5-foot-3-inch robot has been tested in Chinese car factories. This development represents a significant step forward in robotics, aiming to enhance productivity by allowing machines to operate continuously.</p>

          <p>According to an opinion article, Donald Trump faces a significant political challenge with the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, as his attempts to deflect and distract only fuel deeper suspicion. Having built his political brand on promoting conspiracy theories about a secretive "deep state," he now presides over that same state and is being pressured to release information he claims is being hidden. This puts him in a difficult position with his base, which expects transparency on this issue. The author suggests that Trump's relationship with Epstein complicates his ability to navigate the situation, forcing him to play with political fires that could burn him.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is facing backlash after signing a law that weakens the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies. The move came as these agencies were reportedly investigating some of his close allies, and Zelensky justified it by suggesting the presence of Russian moles within the justice system. The decision sparked street protests in Kyiv, compelling the president to introduce new legislation to reverse the changes. This event is seen by some analysts as a betrayal of democratic principles and a sign that the global pressure for good governance has waned.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Senators Urge Halt to US Funding for Gaza Aid Group</h2>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to stop funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed grave concerns about the Israeli-backed private organization, which has been criticized for its aid distribution methods and the high number of civilian deaths near its sites. They are urging the U.S. to cease its $30 million pledge to GHF and instead resume support for established UN-led aid mechanisms. This comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis and reports of mass starvation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Megan Horneman, CIO of Verdence Capital Advisors, has expressed concern that the stock market is "pricing in perfection" and is overly complacent about several looming risks. She highlights the uncertainty surrounding the August 1 U.S. trade tariff deadline, potential shifts in Federal Reserve policy, and technically overbought conditions, particularly in growth and tech stocks. While remaining bullish in the long term, Horneman suggests a short-term valuation correction is possible and advises investors to ensure their portfolios are appropriately allocated to navigate potential volatility.

          <p>Israel has initiated a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow for the establishment of secure aid corridors, amid mounting international pressure over a severe hunger crisis. Following the announcement, aid convoys from Jordan and the UAE began delivering supplies. However, the situation remains volatile, with medics reporting that Israeli fire killed nine people near an aid route shortly after the pause began. While the UN and world leaders have welcomed the move, they stress that a full ceasefire is the only sustainable solution to the humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team staged a remarkable comeback to secure a draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, keeping the series alive. After being put under immense pressure, India batted for over five sessions in their second innings, with Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar both scoring centuries in an unbroken 203-run partnership. England's bowlers toiled on a placid pitch but were unable to break the determined Indian resistance. England still leads the five-match series 2-1 heading into the final Test at The Oval.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for talks aimed at ending a deadly border dispute that has killed at least 34 people and displaced over 168,000. The meeting follows diplomatic pressure from the U.S. to de-escalate the conflict, which flared up after a land mine explosion injured Thai soldiers. Despite the planned talks, fighting continued over the weekend, with both nations trading blame for renewed shelling. The 500-mile border has been a point of contention for decades, but the recent clashes represent a significant escalation.</p>

The ADF, which originated in Uganda but is now based in DR Congo, frequently carries out attacks on civilians. This incident highlights the ongoing violence in the mineral-rich region despite the presence of both Congolese and Ugandan troops.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed to a deal to transfer Colombian forward Luis Diaz to German champions Bayern Munich for a fee of €75 million (£65.5 million), including add-ons.

Diaz joined Liverpool from Porto in 2022 and had a prolific 2024-25 season, scoring 17 goals. His departure comes as Liverpool has been actively signing new forwards to refresh its attacking lineup.</p>

This strong performance is seen as a positive sign for Marvel Studios, which has experienced fluctuating box office results since "Avengers: Endgame." The success suggests that a focus on quality over quantity for well-known characters can still draw large audiences to theaters.</p>

Thomas Massie, have suggested a pardon could be considered if it compelled her to provide more information about Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. The discussion follows a meeting between Maxwell and the deputy attorney general, as the Trump administration faces ongoing pressure to disclose more details related to the Epstein scandal.</p>
