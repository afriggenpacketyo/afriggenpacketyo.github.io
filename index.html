          <p>Vani Hari, known as the 'Food Babe,' defends Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy's efforts to reform American health policy, arguing that the current system has failed to protect public health. She criticizes the booing of Calley Means, an advisor to Secretary Kennedy, at a Politico Health Care Summit for speaking the truth about the failures of the HHS and the FDA. Hari asserts that decades of ineffective regulations have allowed harmful chemicals and poor nutritional standards to permeate the American food system, leading to alarming rates of chronic diseases. She supports the removal of entrenched bureaucrats and calls for a total overhaul of regulatory bodies to prioritize prevention over pharmaceutical profits.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's across-the-board 10% tariffs on nearly all imports have taken effect, marking the initial phase of his 'Liberation Day' trade policy. The tariffs are expected to be followed by more severe taxes on imports from specific countries, including China and the European Union, later in the month. This development has triggered significant turmoil in financial markets, with the recent trading session marking the worst day for U.S. stocks since 2020. Trump has dismissed concerns regarding the short-term economic pain anticipated to be borne by American consumers as a consequence of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Senate has adopted a Republican budget resolution following an all-night voting session, bringing Congress closer to enacting President Trump's agenda. The resolution aims to make permanent the tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term, authorize $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts, and raise the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion. Democrats criticized the plan, arguing that Republicans are pretending their trillion-dollar tax cuts are free. The framework now goes to the House for a vote.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's selection of Paula White, a televangelist known for controversial views and financial practices, to head the 'White House faith office' has sparked criticism from some fellow Christians. White's past statements, including calling the Black Lives Matter movement the 'Antichrist' and offering 'resurrection seeds' for sale, have raised concerns about her suitability for the role. Critics question her adherence to biblical convictions and express unease over her financial dealings.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent tariff announcements are being criticized as a reckless act that could severely damage the U.S. and global economies, potentially leading to a recession. Economists warn that the tariffs, which are essentially taxes on imports, will increase costs for American families and destabilize the world's trading system. The article argues that Trump's actions are driven by impulsiveness and ignorance, and that the potential benefits of creating more manufacturing jobs are outweighed by the immense economic risks.</p>

          <p>Following the ousting of former President Bashar Assad, sectarian killings have ravaged Syrian villages, particularly targeting Alawites. The violence has left hundreds dead and fractured the new Syrian government's attempts to legitimize its rule. While the government has formed an investigative committee, the task of assigning blame is complicated by the involvement of various armed factions. The international community has demanded accountability for the violence, but many Alawites remain skeptical that justice will be served.</p>

          <p>TikTok creators in the United States have experienced a range of emotions, from sadness and fear to resignation, over the app's uncertain future due to potential bans and sales. Despite extensions allowing the app to continue operating, the constant uncertainty and potential changes to the platform have led to fatigue and a sense of being used as a 'political football'. Experts suggest that this emotional exhaustion is related to broader issues of stress and lack of control in the current political and media landscape, but offer coping strategies such as finding support groups and focusing on past resilience.</p>
