        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has reportedly made an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to acquire Google's Chrome browser. This bid follows a U.S. Department of Justice proposal that Google divest Chrome as part of an antitrust ruling against the tech giant's search market monopoly. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, recently launched its own browser and has secured investor backing for the ambitious deal. The move represents a significant challenge to Google's control over a key gateway to the internet.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party took power in the UK last summer. The milestone has intensified political debate, with the government vowing to address the issue while opposition parties criticize its handling of illegal immigration. The news coincided with a report of a woman's death while attempting the crossing from France. This figure is notably higher than the number of crossings during the same period a year earlier under the previous government.</p>

          <p>Sports merchandise giant Fanatics is launching a new loyalty program called Fanatics ONE, aiming to create an integrated rewards system across its diverse business lines. The program will allow members to earn points on purchases from merchandise, collectibles, and its sportsbook, which can be redeemed for products, tickets, and exclusive experiences. This initiative seeks to unify the company's expanding platform, which has grown beyond apparel into a multi-billion dollar sports enterprise.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An interview with Israeli pollster Dahlia Scheindlin explores the seemingly contradictory attitudes of the Israeli public regarding the Gaza war. Polling indicates that while a majority of Israelis support a ceasefire, this is driven primarily by concern for hostages and soldiers, not the welfare of Gazan civilians. The article discusses deep-seated dehumanization, denial of the starvation crisis fueled by a belief it is propaganda, and a media environment that rarely covers Palestinian suffering. This public sentiment shapes the political landscape, making a broader peace initiative difficult for leaders to pursue.</p>

The 29-year-old stated that conversations with manager David Moyes were key to his decision to move to the Liverpool-based club. After falling out of favor at Manchester City, the move offers Grealish an opportunity to secure more regular playing time and rejuvenate his career.

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has issued a formal warning about its ability to remain in business over the next year, citing "substantial doubt" due to adverse market conditions. Despite emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, the airline continues to face challenges including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and rising operational costs. The company is exploring cost-cutting measures, including pilot furloughs and potential sales of aircraft and real estate, to secure necessary liquidity. The announcement caused the airline's stock to fall sharply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.7% year-over-year in July, a slightly cooler rate than economists had predicted. On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.2%, aligning with forecasts. The data highlighted ongoing stress from food prices, with grocery costs up 2.2% annually and many Americans citing them as a major source of anxiety. Despite inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts believe the moderate overall reading keeps the possibility of a September interest rate cut on the table.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. inflation remained steady in July, with the consumer price index rising 2.7% annually, as falling gas and grocery prices offset other increases. However, economists point to concerning signs within the data, particularly a rise in "core" inflation to 3.1%, its fastest pace since February. This increase is attributed in part to the effects of administration tariffs on imported goods like apparel and furnishings. Experts suggest these policy-driven price pressures may become more pronounced in the coming months, even as the headline inflation number appears stable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article proposes that instead of chasing management fads, companies should focus on a timeless principle: employee happiness. Citing research from firms like Irrational Capital, it argues that companies scoring high on employee satisfaction metrics consistently outperform their peers in stock performance, more so than those offering high extrinsic rewards like pay. The piece identifies six key drivers of satisfaction, including valuing employee ideas, clear communication, and fostering friendships. It concludes that treating employees as humans rather than machines is the most effective path to both profitability and a better quality of life.</p>

          <p>Glendora Continental, a 45-year-old family-run restaurant and a cornerstone of the local Basque community in Southern California, is being sold. The establishment is one of the last remaining vestiges of the Basque diaspora's cultural presence in the region, which has seen numerous similar restaurants close in the last decade. The article chronicles the immigrant story of its founders and its role as a social hub for generations. The sale reflects a broader trend of second and third-generation immigrant families moving on from the demanding restaurant business.</p>

          <p>This article examines the differences between money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts for savers in the current economic climate. While both offer higher interest rates than standard accounts, money market accounts typically provide check-writing and debit card access, sometimes in exchange for higher minimum balance requirements. Experts suggest high-yield savings accounts are often ideal for building emergency funds, while money market accounts can suit those who need occasional direct payment access from a large cash reserve. With potential Fed rate cuts looming, savers are advised to compare APYs, minimums, and accessibility features for each option. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but don't need the cash, financial experts suggest several strategies. One option is to reinvest the funds in a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like ETFs. Another popular strategy for the charitably inclined is the qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer from an IRA to a nonprofit. For those focused on legacy planning, using the RMD to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members can also be a tax-advantaged move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chad's former prime minister and opposition leader, Succes Masra, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for charges including illegal possession of ammunition and inciting violence. The verdict is widely viewed by critics and human rights groups as a politically motivated move by President Mahamat Idriss Deby to silence a key rival and consolidate power. Masra, who denies the charges, had briefly served in Deby's transitional government before contesting and losing the recent presidential election. The sentence has been called a "chilling message" that undermines hopes for democratic reform in the country.</p>

While initial talks have reportedly occurred, a potential deal may hinge on persuading Guehi that a move to Anfield is right for his career.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that cutting federal support for Medicaid, as proposed in a recent Republican bill, will create significant hidden costs that ripple throughout society. While aimed at reducing the budget deficit, the move could cause millions to lose insurance, shifting the financial burden onto other entities. Federally qualified health centers and nonprofit hospitals, which act as a safety net, would face immense strain from an increase in uncompensated care. Furthermore, individuals would face higher risks of medical debt and bankruptcy, and the broader economy could suffer from a less healthy, less productive workforce.</p>
