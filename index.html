        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, fell sharply after the European Commission announced plans to increase steel tariffs and reduce import quotas. The proposal aims to protect the EU's domestic steel industry but has sparked panic in the automotive sector, which fears higher costs and inflationary pressure. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association argued the measures are excessive and will negatively impact the industry, which sources about 90% of its steel from within the EU. The move compounds existing challenges for automakers, such as slowing growth in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 24 people were killed and 47 injured after Myanmar's military used a motorized paraglider to drop bombs on a crowd protesting the junta. The attack occurred during a national holiday gathering in the Sagaing region, a major battleground in the ongoing civil war. This incident highlights the military's escalating use of unconventional aerial tactics, like paramotors, amid international sanctions that have limited its access to traditional aircraft. Amnesty International has condemned this "disturbing trend" and called for urgent protection for civilians.</p>

Noem met with local law enforcement and warned she might send more federal officers if security measures are not met. Oregon's governor expressed confidence in local law enforcement and reiterated the state's opposition to military policing tactics.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi for their pioneering work on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These are molecular constructions with large internal spaces that can be used for various applications, such as capturing carbon dioxide, storing toxic gases, and harvesting water from desert air. The Nobel Committee highlighted the enormous potential of MOFs for creating custom-made materials with new functions. The laureates' research, which began in 1989, represents a significant advancement in materials science.</p>

          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, has announced plans for a "marathon of reforms" to address a budget deficit exceeding €30 billion. Klingbeil stated that the government cannot close this financial gap without cuts but emphasized that the reforms must be fair to avoid losing public trust. He indicated that his Social Democratic Party would support welfare reforms in conjunction with higher taxes for high earners as part of a package with the ruling conservative bloc.

          <p>Florida Republican Representative Randy Fine directed inflammatory remarks at New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, calling him "little more than a Muslim terrorist." In a post on X, Fine asserted that Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, should have his citizenship revoked and be deported. The comments were in response to Mamdani's statement on the anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, in which he condemned the attack as a war crime but also accused the Israeli government of waging a "genocidal war."</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, have introduced legislation to provide financial relief for federal workers' childcare expenses during the ongoing government shutdown. The Federal Worker Childcare Protection Act of 2025 would allow furloughed or unpaid employees to be reimbursed for childcare fees. The bill aims to support workers who are facing financial strain and are being treated as "expendable" in the political standoff. This proposal is one of several Democratic efforts to mitigate the shutdown's impact on federal employees and contractors, as the White House and Congress remain deadlocked.</p>

Global health experts warn this could have "unimaginable effects," potentially disrupting programs that support women's health, HIV prevention, and vaccination efforts by targeting specific vulnerable groups.

The vending machine-style kiosks, operated by Amazon Pharmacy, aim to remove the barrier of a separate trip to a pharmacy, a reason many prescriptions go unfilled. This move represents another step in Amazon's push into the healthcare industry and poses a new challenge to traditional pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens.

          <p>Patrick Henry's power as an orator was a pivotal force in mobilizing popular support for the American Revolution, despite his secondary status among the Founding Fathers. Rejecting the formal, reason-based rhetoric of the elite, Henry adopted an emotional, evangelical style that appealed directly to the passions of ordinary citizens. His famous "Liberty or Death" speech, delivered to a hesitant Virginia Convention, transformed the debate by framing the conflict as an existential choice between freedom and slavery. This democratic and populist approach was revolutionary in itself, empowering a broader segment of the populace and making the break with Britain feel both necessary and inevitable.</p>

Newly accessible royal papers reveal a more complex figure: a conscientious, pious, and scientifically curious monarch who was deeply engaged in the details of governing. While he was stubborn in his conviction that American independence would unravel the British empire, his actions were rooted in a principled, if flawed, defense of the British constitution. The article also explores his recurring bouts of severe mental illness, now believed to be bipolar disorder, which afflicted him long after the American war was lost.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the unique geology of Concord, Massachusetts, played a crucial role in its dual identity as a cradle of both the American Revolution and the Transcendentalist movement. The region's fertile, marshy lowlands, formed by glacial retreat, made it an ideal location for the first inland English settlement and later a strategic depot for military supplies. This landscape, including Walden Pond, also provided the natural inspiration for writers like Emerson and Thoreau. The article argues that Concord's history is deeply rooted in its physical environment, which shaped its agricultural economy, strategic importance, and the philosophical movements it fostered.</p>

          <p>The American Revolution created a deep and permanent division between Benjamin Franklin and his only son, William Franklin, who was the royal governor of New Jersey. Once inseparable confidants, their political differences became irreconcilable, with William remaining a staunch Loyalist to the Crown. The conflict escalated until William was arrested and imprisoned in 1776, an ordeal during which his father offered no assistance. This article details their painful estrangement, highlighting how natural duties became secondary to political ones, culminating in Benjamin effectively disinheriting William and taking his grandson, Temple, to raise in France, forever severing the paternal bond.</p>

          <p>During the American Revolution, thousands of enslaved people, like Harry Washington from Mount Vernon, escaped to fight for the British in exchange for their freedom. Lord Dunmore's 1775 emancipation proclamation created the first Black regiment in the British empire, whose uniforms bore the motto "Liberty for Slaves." This alliance terrified Patriot slave owners and was a significant factor in pushing Virginia toward independence. After the British defeat, these Black Loyalists faced a new struggle, with many evacuating to places like Nova Scotia and later Sierra Leone, establishing the first free Black communities but facing immense hardship and broken promises.</p>

          <p>A long-standing literary debate centers on Jane Austen's 1814 novel "Mansfield Park" and what it reveals about her and her society's views on slavery. The novel is her only work to directly mention the slave trade, as the wealth of the central family comes from a plantation in Antigua. Critics like Edward Said have argued the novel reflects a tacit acceptance of the imperial, slave-based economy, pointing to a "dead silence" that follows a character's question about the slave trade. Other scholars find coded anti-slavery messages or suggest Austen held a more moderate view of her time: opposing the slave trade but not slavery itself.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, though weakening, continues as a powerful Category 2 storm off the Pacific coast of Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is currently moving parallel to the coast of Baja California Sur, bringing large swells and the risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents. A tropical storm watch is in effect for a portion of the peninsula, from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. With maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, Priscilla is expected to continue losing strength over the next 48 hours as it moves northwest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating James Comey concluded that their central witness, law professor Daniel Richman, would be "problematic" for their case, according to sources familiar with their findings. Richman allegedly told investigators that the former FBI director never authorized him to leak information anonymously and, in fact, told him not to speak to the media on two occasions. This testimony undermines the core charge that Comey lied to Congress about authorizing leaks. Despite career prosecutors recommending against it, a new U.S. attorney, appointed after pressure from Donald Trump, proceeded with the indictment, raising further questions about the case's political motivations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially labeling China a "threat to national security." This designation became a necessary legal threshold following a precedent set in another spy case earlier this year. Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements from the government that met this standard, forcing them to drop the charges. The rare public statement from the DPP highlights a significant clash between the legal system and the government's diplomatic posture toward China.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has accused Russia of waging a "targeted gray zone campaign" against Europe, involving sabotage, cyberattacks, and airspace violations. Speaking to EU lawmakers, she warned that these hybrid attacks will escalate if not met with a firm response. Von der Leyen cited recent incidents of drones overflying military bases in several EU countries and breaches of Estonian airspace. In response, the EU is developing a plan to bolster its defenses by 2030, which includes creating a high-tech "drone wall" for detection and interception.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy has intercepted a nine-vessel flotilla carrying food and medical supplies that was attempting to breach the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. The operation, run by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, was stopped in international waters, with all 150 passengers reported to be safe and awaiting deportation. This event follows a similar interception last week of a larger convoy that included activist Greta Thunberg. Israel maintains the blockade is legal and necessary for security, while organizers and allies like Turkey condemn the action as a violation of international law amid a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high, exceeding $4,000 an ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets due to global economic and political instability. The rally, the largest since the 1970s, is fueled by concerns over US-led trade tariffs and delays in economic data releases caused by the U.S. government shutdown. This trend is also supported by central banks, particularly in China and India, which have been strategically increasing their gold reserves to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. While analysts see potential for a continued upward trend, they also caution that prices could fall if geopolitical tensions ease. (not investment advice)</p>

Established by Alfred Nobel's will, the prize honors individuals or organizations for promoting "fraternity between the nations." The winner is selected by a Norwegian committee from a confidential list of over 300 candidates. The article addresses speculation about Donald Trump receiving the award, noting he has been nominated by foreign leaders for his second-term diplomatic efforts. While four U.S. presidents have won the prize, experts believe the committee is unlikely to select Trump, though Barack Obama's 2009 win shows precedents can be broken.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pumpkin has a complex history, evolving from a vital food source for Indigenous peoples and early European settlers to a modern symbol of autumn and agrarian nostalgia. The word itself traveled from Greek ("pepon") to French ("pompon") before being applied to the American gourd, where it was also quickly adopted as an insult for someone empty-headed. According to historian Cindy Ott, the pumpkin's image was rehabilitated in the 19th century as urbanization grew, becoming a romanticized link to a simpler, farm-based past. Today, this symbolism helps support small family farms that have turned pumpkin patches into popular seasonal attractions.</p>

          <p>A new research paper challenges the long-held belief that Ernest Shackleton's famed Antarctic vessel, the Endurance, was an exceptionally strong ship for its time. Jukka Tuhkuri, a professor of arctic marine technology, argues that the ship had several structural weaknesses that made it unsuitable for the compressive force of pack ice. The paper, based on historical records and technical analysis, suggests Shackleton himself was aware of these deficiencies, having written that the ship was not as strong as his previous vessel, the Nimrod. This research adds a new engineering perspective to the legendary story of the ship's demise.</p>

Sociologists suggest that public discourse can intensify hiring discrimination, and studies confirm that applicants with African-sounding names are less likely to receive callbacks.
