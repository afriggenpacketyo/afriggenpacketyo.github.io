          <p>Intense Israeli bombardment has forced thousands to flee Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood, creating a catastrophic humanitarian situation. The Hamas-run municipality reports at least 40 fatalities from recent attacks, while the UN warns of widespread malnutrition and impending famine as aid access remains severely restricted. Meanwhile, in Israel, a general strike is underway, with protesters and hostage families opposing the government's plan to occupy Gaza City, arguing it endangers the lives of those held captive by Hamas. The conflict, which began after the October 7th attack, has resulted in over 61,000 Palestinian deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British horse racing industry has scheduled an unprecedented one-day strike for September 10th, canceling four race meetings in protest of a proposed government tax increase on betting. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) is campaigning against the Treasury's plan to raise the remote gambling tax, which they argue would be catastrophic for the sport. The BHA's economic analysis predicts the tax hike could lead to a £330 million loss in revenue and jeopardize over 2,700 jobs in its first year alone. This action marks the first time the sport has voluntarily stopped racing in its modern history over a government proposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new judicial interpretation in China strengthening the enforcement of mandatory social insurance contributions is inadvertently boosting the employment of retirees. Companies are increasingly hiring older workers because they are not required to pay these contributions for them, a trend highlighted by recent recruitment notices from McDonald's. This has sparked widespread concern on social media, with many young people fearing that their job opportunities will shrink as a record number of university graduates enter the workforce. The stricter enforcement aims to address China's growing pension crisis by ensuring businesses comply with their obligations.</p>

Cooper cited incidents for which the group claimed responsibility, including one that resulted in three injuries and another causing an estimated £7 million in damages, noting that the Crown Prosecution Service assessed these charges as having a "terrorism connection." Her comments coincide with the Metropolitan Police announcing that an additional 60 people will be prosecuted for supporting the group, bringing the total number of arrests since the ban to over 700.</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel, 76, is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and will auction his personal collection of over 75 bikes. This decision follows his recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder that affects his balance, vision, and hearing. The condition, which is exacerbated by performing, also led Joel to cancel all of his tour dates for 2025 and through mid-2026. The shop, opened in 2010, served as a showcase for his collection and a way to support the local Oyster Bay community.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, secured a 41-24 victory over Argentina in their Rugby Championship opener, allowing them to return to the number one spot in the world rankings for the first time in four years. Despite a second-half comeback attempt by the Pumas, New Zealand sealed the win with late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho. The All Blacks replaced South Africa at the top of the rankings after the latter's loss to Australia. The victory extends Argentina's winless streak against New Zealand on home soil to 15 matches.</p>

          <p>The governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of hundreds of their states' National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. This move is in support of the Trump administration's federal intervention aimed at addressing crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. The deployment significantly escalates the federal presence, which began with an executive order that federalized local police and activated the D.C. National Guard. The action has drawn protests from residents and city officials who argue it is an unnecessary overreach, given that violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>In the 11 days since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" migrant agreement, over 2,500 people have crossed the Channel in small boats. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a strong asylum case, though no returns have yet occurred. This influx continues a trend that has seen over 50,000 crossings since July 2024, putting pressure on the Labour government to deliver on its promise to stop the boats.

          <p>In a personal essay, columnist Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett explores how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a profound connection forged through life experiences. She recounts how trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood allowed her to see the deep emotional complexity in works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Raphael, which she had previously dismissed. Cosslett contrasts her former cynicism with her current ability to be moved by art, linking this emotional openness to a greater capacity for empathy. She suggests that engaging with historical art helps us connect with contemporary human suffering.</p>

The flight attendants' union, CUPE, condemned the move as a violation of their constitutional right to strike and accused the government of rewarding the airline's refusal to negotiate fairly.

In 2015, detective Clark Schwartzkopf met Miller at a Chili's restaurant under the pretense of an interview, with the real goal of obtaining his DNA from a water glass. Although initially skeptical that the mild-mannered Miller could be the killer, the DNA from the glass provided a perfect match to evidence found on victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Miller was subsequently arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death in 2023 for the brutal murders.</p>
