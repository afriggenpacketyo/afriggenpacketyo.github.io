          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call to discuss a potential deal to prevent a U.S. ban on the social media platform TikTok. The conversation follows an agreement on a deal "framework" earlier in the week, as confirmed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This high-level communication is seen as a vital step in stabilizing the tense relationship between the two economic superpowers. The call also helps pave the way for a potential in-person summit between the two leaders at the upcoming APEC conference, which would be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump returned to office.</p>

          <p>A rare 3,000-year-old golden bracelet belonging to King Amenemope has been permanently lost after being stolen from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. A restoration specialist at the museum confessed to stealing the artifact from a lab and selling it for less than $4,000. The bracelet was subsequently passed through several buyers before being melted down by a gold workshop owner, erasing a significant piece of history. Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft, but the irreplaceable cultural artifact is gone forever, sparking public outrage over the loss and the perceived negligence.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron defended his decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, asserting it is a necessary step to combat and isolate Hamas. Responding to criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the plan "reckless," Macron stated that Hamas's objective is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a Palestinian state. He argued that pursuing a peace plan that includes statehood recognition is a precondition for stopping the war and undermining the extremist group's goals. France plans to formalize its decision at the United Nations General Assembly, joining other allies like the U.K. and Canada in this diplomatic shift.</p>

          <p>An opinion article challenges the prevailing narrative of a drastic decline in China's population, suggesting that such gloomy projections should be viewed with skepticism. The author points out the lack of clear justification for forecasts that show China's population plummeting while the U.S. population is expected to grow significantly. In contrast, the article highlights alternative data from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities. Their moderate scenarios project China's population to be around 1.12 billion by the end of the century, a far less dramatic decrease than often reported in Western media.</p>

          <p>As companies like American Express and JPMorgan Chase increase the annual fees on their premium travel credit cards, consumers are prompted to re-evaluate their value. The cards now boast thousands of dollars in annual benefits, primarily through statement credits for specific vendors like Lululemon, Uber, and StubHub. Financial experts advise cardholders to conduct a personal analysis based on their travel patterns, shopping habits, and lifestyle to determine if the high fees are justified.

This move comes despite the military's widespread contamination of drinking water near hundreds of bases and research showing high levels of PFAS in service members' blood.

While the rate cut may offer some relief, its effects on consumer borrowing costs will likely be gradual. Experts suggest that refinancing generally makes sense when there is at least a one-percentage-point difference between a borrower's current rate and a new potential rate. Homeowners who secured mortgages in the last three years at higher rates may see the most immediate benefit, but all borrowers are encouraged to carefully calculate potential savings against closing costs and fees.

          <h2>Xinjiang Official Acknowledges US Sanctions Have Harmed Local Employment</h2>

          <p>In a rare admission, a senior official from China's Xinjiang region has acknowledged that U.S. sanctions have negatively impacted the local economy and job market. Chen Weijun, vice-chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, stated that sanctions have created difficulties for some enterprises in exporting their products, leading to reduced production and fewer job opportunities for workers of all ethnicities, including Uygurs. While expressing confidence in the region's long-term development, this is the first time a local official has publicly confirmed the adverse effects of the sanctions, which were imposed by the U.S. over allegations of human rights abuses.</p>

          <h2>US Law Enforcement Agencies Reportedly Profiled Gang Affiliation Based on Emoji Use</h2>

          <p>Internal documents reveal that U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and NYPD, have claimed that the use of certain emojis could indicate affiliation with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). The reports, disseminated in 2024 and 2025, identified emojis like trains, ninjas, and strawberries as part of the gang's "code language." Gang experts and immigration attorneys have criticized these claims as "ludicrous" and "baseless," raising concerns that such profiling could lead to erroneous labeling and severe consequences like deportation. This practice echoes previous controversies where authorities have cited innocuous tattoos as proof of gang membership.</p>

          <h2>Critique of AI Doomsday Scenarios Finds Flaws in Core Arguments</h2>

          <p>A book review of "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies" critiques the arguments made by AI doomsayers like Eliezer Yudkowsky, describing their case for an AI apocalypse as tendentious and logically flawed. The article argues that the authors fail to provide scientific evidence for their claims, instead relying on shaky analogies and a fundamental misunderstanding of intelligence as a simple, measurable concept. It suggests that the fear of a resource-hungry, exterminating superintelligence is an anthropomorphic projection of no-holds-barred capitalism. Ultimately, the piece concludes that both the doomers and the AI utopians share the same flawed fantasy of an all-powerful technology that will inevitably transform the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of large, predatory dinosaur, Newtonsaurus cambrensis, from a 125-year-old fossil that had been housed at the National Museum of Wales. The fossil, a lower jawbone, was discovered in a Triassic-era fossil bed and had been misclassified for decades. Using modern 3D scanning technology, researchers created a digital reconstruction that revealed it belonged to a previously unknown genus. The discovery is significant because the dinosaur's large size is unprecedented for a theropod from the Triassic period, challenging the consensus that large carnivorous dinosaurs only emerged later in the Jurassic period.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new, 19th package of sanctions against Russia in an effort to increase pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. While details are forthcoming, the new measures are expected to target Russia's fossil fuel imports, banks, and cryptocurrency sector. The proposal comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls for more "decisive action" from allies following another large-scale Russian drone attack. EU finance ministers are also discussing the use of profits from frozen Russian assets to provide further financial aid to Kyiv, signaling a continued and coordinated effort to support Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A senior UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a method he has employed at the U.S. southern border. However, UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is the appropriate agency for policing borders and that the military's focus should remain on national defense. He noted that while the navy can be called upon for support, its primary role is not domestic migration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has uncovered significant issues with Walmart's third-party online marketplace, including the sale of counterfeit products and sellers using stolen identities. As Walmart rapidly expanded its digital platform to compete with Amazon, its vetting processes for sellers became more lax, according to former employees. The investigation found numerous instances of fraudulent sellers offering fake health and beauty products, posing potential safety risks to consumers. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly tightened its vetting procedures for some categories, but the report highlights the challenges and risks associated with the rapid growth of online retail marketplaces.</p>

          <p>An opinion article criticizes President Trump's extreme reaction to a court of appeals ruling that found his across-the-board tariffs illegal. Trump claimed the decision would "literally destroy the United States of America," a statement the author dismisses as bonkers and a tactic to intimidate the Supreme Court. The piece argues that blocking the tariffs would actually benefit the U.S. economy by reducing inflation and that Trump's invocation of a national emergency was a pretext for his tariff obsession. The author suggests Trump's hysterical language is aimed at the Supreme Court's conservative justices, hoping to scare them into upholding his expansive use of presidential power.</p>

          <p>Neo-fascist fight clubs, known as "active clubs," are capitalizing on the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk to attract new members. These groups, which are viewed by authorities as a growing domestic terrorism threat, are using Kirk's death as a rallying cry, framing it as evidence of an "anti-White" campaign by the left. Online posts from these clubs urge white men to join their movement for vengeance and camaraderie. Despite ideological differences with Kirk, whom some extremists accused of being an agent for Israel, the groups see his killing as a major inflection point to spread their radical message to a more receptive audience.</p>
