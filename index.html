        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a call between senior officials, the U.S. and China agreed to maintain open communication lines, indicating continued engagement towards a broader trade agreement. The call, between Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, follows high-level talks in Geneva where both sides agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. This call signals a reconnection on the diplomatic level and may pave the way for future talks on curbing fentanyl flows, a key priority for President Trump. The meeting also comes as trade tensions have raised fears of economic decoupling between the world's two largest economies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first price drop in a year. This translates to a Â£129 reduction in the annual bill for a typical household using gas and electricity. While this provides some relief, many people still struggle to afford energy, with customers owing suppliers approximately Â£4 billion. Despite the decrease, prices remain significantly higher than historical levels, and the regulator's price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which operates its own energy market.</p>

          <p>North Korea has initiated an investigation into an accident during the launch of its new naval destroyer, with leader Kim Jong Un calling the incident a "criminal act caused by absolute carelessness". The accident involved damage to the ship's bottom due to a transport cradle detaching early during the launch ceremony at Chongji shipyard. While initial reports described the damage as serious, later assessments indicated it was less severe, with only scratches and minor seawater inflow. South Korea believes the warship is similar to the Choe Hyon, potentially developed with Russian assistance.</p>

Many of Harvard's sports teams rely heavily on international athletes, with some teams having a majority of players from foreign countries. The Department of Homeland Security cited an unsafe campus environment due to antisemitism as the reason for the revocation, potentially forcing thousands of foreign students to transfer or leave the country.

This shift indicates the growing influence of Chinese carmakers in the European EV market, even with tariffs in place.

It argues that this trend fuels a climate of doubt and prejudice, undermining efforts to promote equality and inclusion.

She highlights the complex history of South Africa, where economic inequality persists despite the end of apartheid, and criticizes Trump's misleading portrayal of the situation.

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by revoking its ability to enroll international students, citing an unsafe campus environment due to antisemitism. This action could cost the institution half a billion dollars, impacting its finances and academic diversity. The move follows previous federal funding cuts and accusations of civil rights violations. While Harvard has generally sought to cooperate with the Trump administration's demands, the situation remains contentious, raising concerns about academic freedom and government overreach.</p>

Energy prices rose 9.3 percent, accelerating from a 6.6 percent increase in March, with electricity prices surging 13.5 percent and those for city gas climbing 4.7 percent.

          <p>The United States will impose new sanctions on Sudan after determining that the Sudanese military used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The sanctions will restrict US exports to Sudan and limit financial borrowing from June 6. The state department stated that Sudan used chemical weapons last year, though no detail was provided about which chemical weapons the US said it found. The US calls on the government of Sudan to cease all chemical weapons use and uphold its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>
