        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire is hindering efforts to end the war. This comes as former U.S. President Donald Trump, after a summit with Vladimir Putin, has shifted his stance to advocate for a direct peace agreement, bypassing a ceasefire which he claims often fails. Trump reportedly relayed a Russian peace offer to Zelensky, which would involve Ukraine ceding territory in the Donbas region. European leaders are expressing concern that Trump may pressure Ukraine into accepting unfavorable terms during their upcoming meeting in Washington.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration has brokered a deal allowing tech companies Nvidia and AMD to sell certain artificial intelligence chips to China. The agreement comes with a novel condition: the companies must share 15% of their revenue from these sales with the U.S. government. This "revenue-sharing" model, which critics argue is effectively an export tax, has raised concerns among trade experts about setting a dangerous precedent where national security-based export controls could be perceived as being for sale. The legality of the arrangement is reportedly still under review by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media after a three-week silence following the mixed public reaction to her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle. The campaign, which played on the double meaning of "genes" and "jeans," was criticized by some for having racial undertones, while others defended it against "woke" criticism. Sweeney, who has not publicly commented on the controversy, posted photos from a night out with friends. The article notes that despite the backlash, some PR experts believe the controversy could ultimately boost her career by generating significant publicity.</p>

          <p>An incident involving federal immigration agents in San Bernardino resulted in shots being fired at a vehicle. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers were injured when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and drove at them during a traffic stop, causing an officer to discharge their firearm in self-defense. However, the driver contacted police claiming masked men shot at him, and video from a community group appears to show agents breaking the car's windows before shots are heard. The San Bernardino Police Department responded but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits assisting with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

The cancellation follows former U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of a cumulative 50% tariff rate on Indian exports, one of the highest for any U.S. trading partner, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, especially since other Western nations continue to trade with Russia.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method for making biological tissues, including the brain, transparent, allowing for the clearest view yet of their internal structures. The technique produces highly accurate and vivid 3D images by preserving the integrity of the organ's morphology while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. According to the scientists, the process creates an "ionic glassy tissue" that forms a stable, solid state at low temperatures. This breakthrough could enable more detailed study of complex biological systems and allows for long-term storage of the prepared samples.</p>

A costly dropped fly ball in the second inning allowed two more runs to score, giving the Dodgers an insurmountable early lead.

Following Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, the U.S. has unexpectedly pivoted away from demanding a ceasefire, now pushing for a direct peace deal that may favor Russian terms, including territorial concessions from Ukraine. Zelensky must navigate these talks carefully, appearing willing to negotiate peace while resisting pressure to accept a disadvantageous agreement. The diplomatic landscape has become increasingly challenging for Kyiv, with fears that deals could be made without its full consent.</p>

The case went cold for over two decades until genetic genealogy pointed to Miller as a suspect, leading detectives to obtain his DNA through an undercover sting at a restaurant. The trial revealed Miller's violent past, including a juvenile stabbing and other allegations, while his defense argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to childhood abuse.

          <p>Chinese scientists have proposed a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that revives NASA's "scissor wing" concept from the 1970s. The design features a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into a "waverider" for high efficiency. This innovative approach aims to solve the long-standing aerodynamic challenge of creating an aircraft that performs well at both subsonic and hypersonic speeds.</p>

          <p>This article, written by a couples' therapist, explores the complex psychological motivations that can lead individuals in committed relationships to have an affair. The author identifies five common triggers, including the pressure of always being "good" and following societal expectations, the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor personal boundaries often developed in childhood. Other significant catalysts include being in an abusive or emotionally neglectful marriage, or experiencing a recent major loss, such as the death of a parent. The piece suggests these factors can create an emotional void or breaking point, making an affair seem like a form of release or self-discovery.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade dispute, Chinese merchants selling on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain worried about the potential for future tariffs. At a recent trade fair, sellers indicated that policy uncertainty is a major concern, with some having previously been forced to suspend their U.S. operations during periods of heightened tensions. While the large U.S. market remains attractive due to its high volume of consumers, the unpredictable nature of trade relations poses a significant risk to their businesses. This highlights the direct impact of geopolitical friction on individual entrepreneurs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., as part of a federal public safety operation "may be armed." This statement represents a shift from earlier guidance, which indicated that weapons would be available but kept in an armory. While the troops are not currently making arrests, their mission is to protect federal property and provide a visible presence to deter crime. The potential for armed soldiers on the streets of the nation's capital has heightened concerns among residents and officials about the escalating nature of the federal intervention.</p>
