          <p>Twenty individuals, including eight adults and twelve juveniles, sustained injuries from a lightning strike while swimming at Dominion Beach Park near Lake Murray Dam in Lexington County, South Carolina. The incident occurred on a bright and sunny Tuesday afternoon when lightning struck a metal cable with buoys surrounding the swimming area. Eighteen people were treated on the scene, and twelve were transported to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, and officials expect all patients to recover. This event occurred during Lightning Safety Awareness Week, highlighting the dangers of lightning strikes, which have caused four reported deaths in the U.S. this year. The fire district noted that lightning can strike far from a cloud, and those present were fortunate the injuries were not worse. Dominion Beach Park is expected to reopen after safety assessments are completed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pushing back against an early Pentagon intelligence report suggesting limited damage to Iran's nuclear program following recent U.S.-Israeli strikes. Trump claims "total obliteration" of the nuclear program, citing additional intelligence and reports from those who have seen the site. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei stated that the country's nuclear facilities had been "badly damaged." Trump stated he is not interested in restarting negotiations with Iran, but suggested talks would occur soon, and the U.S. might sign an agreement. The Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported the President's position, rejecting the early Pentagon analysis and suggesting the leak had political motives.</p>

          <p>Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte was visibly emotional during a game against the Chicago White Sox after a fan made a derogatory comment about his late mother.

Lovullo expressed his support for Marte, emphasizing that he is not alone and that the heckler was "an idiot." Shortstop Geraldo Perdomo condemned the fan's behavior and called for Major League Baseball to take action. Despite the incident, Marte had a strong performance in the game, hitting a home run and going 2-4 in the Diamondbacks' 4-1 victory.</p>

He also mentioned progress on the Israel-Hamas conflict and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss achieving a ceasefire and peace deal.

          <p>Emil Bove, former defense attorney for President Trump and current DOJ official, faced a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for a federal judgeship. Bove disputed allegations of being a "henchman" for Trump, asserting his independence and integrity.

Bove denied the allegations, suggesting the complaint was an attempt by the "unelected bureaucracy" to thwart the president's agenda.

          <p>The United States, after decades of mass incarceration, is seeing a significant decline in its prison population, potentially dropping by roughly 60 percent from its 2009 peak. This shift is attributed to the decline in crime rates since the 1990s, particularly among younger generations, leading to fewer young offenders entering the prison system. While COVID-19 initially accelerated decarceration, a subsequent crime spike threatened to reverse this trend, but crime has since fallen again. Policy recommendations include halting prison construction, supporting prison-closing commissions, and prioritizing compassionate release for elderly and sick inmates.</p>

This downward trend is attributed to rising competition from traditional automakers and Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, such as BYD.

          <p>The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, the world's largest wildlife crossing over the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, is entering its second and final phase. This phase involves installing connectors to link the structure with the Santa Susana Mountains to the north and the Santa Monica Mountains to the south. The work will require burying overhead wires, moving water lines, stabilizing an underground creek, and constructing a tunnel over Agoura Road, while also preserving a grove of native oak trees. Partial closures of Agoura Road are expected to begin in early August and last for several months, with the project's completion date pushed to the end of 2026 due to weather delays.</p>

          <p>The Club World Cup in the USA is facing criticism due to extreme heat conditions, with slow-paced matches and sweltering players becoming common themes. Environmental advocacy groups argue that FIFA is not adequately addressing the dangers of extreme heat, potentially leading to unsafe conditions at future major events like the 2026 World Cup. While FIFA states it prioritizes health and implements cooling breaks, concerns remain about the scheduling of games during the hottest parts of the day and the impact on player welfare. FIFPRO has initiated legal proceedings against FIFA, citing the oversaturated international football calendar as a risk to player safety and wellbeing.</p>

          <p>Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, was executed in Florida for the 1994 sexual assault and murder of Michelle McGrath near an Orlando bar. Gudinas received a lethal injection at Florida State Prison, following decades on death row, after last-day appeals were denied. His lawyers argued that he should be spared due to lifelong mental illness, but the Florida Supreme Court rejected that claim. Gudinas became the seventh person executed in Florida this year, making it the state with the most executions in 2025, and his execution is part of a trend toward a busier year for capital punishment in the U.S.</p>

Over 120 Labour backbenchers have signed an amendment to scrap the proposals, raising the possibility of an embarrassing defeat for the government. Starmer insisted the Labour party was "pretty united" on the principle of reforming the welfare system and dismissed criticism as "noises off". The government's Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill aims to change eligibility for disability and sickness benefits, but critics argue that it will push large numbers into poverty.</p>

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 13.7% in May compared to April, falling to 623,000 units on a seasonally-adjusted annualized basis, according to the U.S. Census. This sales total was also 6.3% lower than May 2024 and below both the 6-month and one-year averages, with analysts anticipating higher sales. The decline is attributed to stubbornly high mortgage rates, which remained around 7% throughout May, impacting affordability for potential buyers. As a result of slower sales, the supply of new homes for sale increased to 507,000 at the end of May, representing a 9.8-month supply, the highest level since the summer of 2022.</p>

Despite being situated on German-owned property, the building is operated by the Russian federal agency "Rossotrudnichestvo," which is on the EU sanctions list since 2022. The German government pays â‚¬70,000 annually in property taxes for the building due to a long-standing agreement with Russia, causing controversy. A Green Party lawmaker is campaigning for the closure of the Russian House, arguing that it has deviated from its original purpose of promoting mutual cultural exchange, but the German government fears potential retaliation by Russia, such as closing the Goethe Institute in Moscow.</p>

However, FedEx stock dropped about 5% in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that came in slightly below Wall Street's expectations. For its fiscal first quarter of 2026, FedEx forecasts revenue will be flat to up 2% year over year, but expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.40 to $4.00, slightly under the StreetAccount estimate of $4.06.
