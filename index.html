          <h2>Trump Administration Insists on Progress in Ukraine Peace Talks Despite Ongoing Russian Strikes</h2>

          <p>President Trump asserted that Ukraine peace talks are progressing, despite resistance to a U.S.-backed proposal from both Russia and Ukraine. This comes even after deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv, which prompted Trump to publicly urge Putin to stop. The U.S. proposal involves recognizing Russian control over seized Ukrainian land, a point of contention for Ukrainian leaders. Secretary of State Rubio emphasized the need for flexibility in negotiations, while others remain skeptical of Russia's commitment to peace. Optimism surrounding this topic is low considering the circumstances.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Humanities is launching a grant program to support President Trump's National Garden of American Heroes, aiming to feature life-size statues of 250 significant American figures. Artists, who must be American citizens, can submit preliminary concepts for statues made of durable materials like marble or bronze. Figures must be chosen from a pre-approved list that includes historical icons, cultural figures, and athletes, all depicted in a realistic style.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to promote deep seabed mining, a move that disregards international treaties and is likely to provoke criticism from allies and rivals. The order directs NOAA to expedite permits for companies to mine in international and U.S. waters. The administration believes this will establish the U.S. as a leader in seabed mineral exploration, but environmental groups are concerned about the potential for irreversible biodiversity loss. This action reflects the Trump administration's willingness to challenge international norms.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to the internet via an unsecured commercial line, known as a "dirty line."

Hegseth has denied sharing classified war plans over Signal and has accused former staffers of leaking information to sabotage Trump's agenda.

          <p>The Trump Organization is selling merchandise branded with "Trump 2028," including hats and T-shirts, despite the U.S. Constitution limiting presidents to two terms. Trump, who will be 82 in 2028, has not ruled out running again and has even suggested breaching the Constitution to do so. The 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, prevents anyone from being elected president more than twice. Amending the Constitution would require a two-thirds majority in both Congressional chambers and ratification by at least 38 states, making it highly unlikely.</p>

          <p>Intel CFO David Zinsner stated that President Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other countries have increased the likelihood of an economic slowdown and potential recession. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, partly due to customers stockpiling chips ahead of tariffs. However, Intel's revenue and profit guidance fell below expectations, causing its stock to decline. Zinsner highlighted the uncertainty caused by tariffs, making it harder for Intel to predict its performance and potentially shrinking the total market for its chips.</p>

The rulings prevent the administration, for now, from cutting off billions of dollars that support teachers, counselors, and academic programs in schools serving low-income children. One judge stated that the administration had not provided a sufficiently detailed definition of "diversity, equity and inclusion." The policy was also deemed to potentially restrict free speech in the classroom and overstep the executive branch’s legal authority.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected first-quarter results but issued disappointing guidance and announced plans to cut operational and capital expenses. The company cited elevated uncertainty due to the macroeconomic environment and fluid trade policies. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who recently took over, stated that the company needs to regain market share and drive sustainable growth. The planned expense cuts will include job reductions, especially for managers, beginning this quarter. Investors hope Tan can turn around the company and improve its competitiveness in the AI chip market.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, revealed that adding polite phrases like "Please" and "Thank you" to chatbot prompts incurs significant costs in electricity. Every interaction with a chatbot consumes energy, and additional words increase the server load. Altman estimated that the collective cost of users being polite to AI models amounts to tens of millions of dollars. While seemingly trivial, the cumulative effect of these extra words contributes to the overall operational expenses of running AI services.</p>

          <p>"The Accountant 2" has been criticized for subtracting everything that made the original 2016 film successful. The sequel, starring Ben Affleck as Christian Wolff, a neurodivergent accountant and assassin, is considered dull and lacking in humor and romance. Critics note that the film's plot, involving human trafficking, is uninspired and that the addition of comedic elements falls flat. The movie is seen as louder and more banal than its predecessor, with a weaker script and less compelling action sequences.</p>
