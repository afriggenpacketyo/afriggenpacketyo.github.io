          <p>India is facing a significant crisis with student suicides accounting for 7.6% of the country's total, with about 13,000 students dying by suicide annually according to 2022 data. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of intense academic pressure, societal expectations, and a lack of adequate mental health support within educational institutions. The Indian government has acknowledged the problem, outlining measures for psychological support, while advocates call for integrating emotional intelligence and stress management into the curriculum. This article highlights the urgent need for systemic changes to create supportive environments and teach students how to cope with failure and uncertainty.</p>

          <h2>Convicted Fraudster Exposed for Planning Elaborate, Non-Existent Music Festival in Wales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that a convicted fraudster named James Kenny orchestrated an elaborate scam involving a fictitious 45,000-capacity music festival called Monmouth Rising. Kenny falsely claimed the event would feature major headliners like The Killers and be funded by prominent investors, deceiving employees, suppliers, and the local community. The plan unraveled when payments failed to materialize and forged documents were discovered, leaving many unpaid and highlighting the vulnerabilities within the festival industry. The fraudster, described as a "fantasist," had a history of similar schemes and has since apologized while promising repayment to those affected.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was eliminated from the Washington Open after a straight-sets loss to Russia's Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-finals. Despite a strong tournament performance that will see her reclaim the British number one ranking, Raducanu could not overcome Kalinskaya, falling 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya capitalized on key break points and maintained aggressive play to secure her spot in the final. She will now face Canadian Leylah Fernandez, who won a grueling three-hour match against Elena Rybakina in the other semi-final.</p>

          <p>A mother from Apple Valley, California, has experienced a remarkable coincidence, giving birth to all four of her children on the same calendar day, July 7, across different years. Nauzhae Drake, 26, welcomed her fourth child on this date, following her three older siblings who were also born on July 7 in 2019, 2021, and 2022. None of the births were induced, and all arrived on dates different from their original due dates, making the event a statistical anomaly. The family celebrates their shared birthday with large parties, and the mother considers the unique timing a blessing.</p>

While Fan has not identified as a feminist, her story of escaping a patriarchal environment has resonated widely, highlighting a growing discontent with gender inequality. The official reaction underscores the government's sensitivity to discussions that challenge societal norms, even as Fan's comedy provides catharsis for many women.</p>

The adopted children were reportedly treated worse than the biological children and were punished by being sprayed with vinegar and beaten with canes.

This contested view of history has long been a sensitive point in diplomatic relations between the two nations.

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing information about deadly mass attacks, such as incidents where drivers ram into pedestrians, leading to public complaints online. Since a particularly deadly attack in November, authorities have tightened control, often releasing vague police statements or scrubbing photos and reports from the internet. This censorship, part of a broader information control strategy under Xi Jinping, is believed to be aimed at preventing copycat crimes and avoiding scrutiny of local authorities. However, the lack of transparency has prompted some citizens and even former state media editors to call for the truth.</p>

This development follows an agreement between the RSF, rebel groups, and civilian politicians to establish a secular "New Sudan."

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield, rejecting her claim of self-defense but acquitting her of second-degree murder. The trial centered on the couple's turbulent relationship, which the defense portrayed as abusive, while the prosecution argued Ashley killed Doug to win a bitter custody battle over their daughter. Prosecutors highlighted Ashley's history of making unproven allegations against Doug and pointed to forensic evidence suggesting he was turning away when shot.

          <p>A new BBC documentary series is set to expose the decades of abuse that occurred within the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical cult in Northamptonshire that disbanded in 2019. An investigation, which began in 2016, uncovered hundreds of cases of trauma, including widespread sexual and physical abuse of children who lived in the group's communal homes. The documentary's director interviewed over 80 survivors, revealing how the cult's founder, Noel Stanton, and its leadership covered up the abuse. The story highlights the lasting trauma inflicted on members and the complex reasons people remain in such controlling environments.</p>

          <h2>Aid Agencies Criticize Gaza Airdrops as an Inefficient and 'Grotesque Distraction'</h2>

          <p>Leaders of major international aid organizations have strongly criticized the plan to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, calling it a "grotesque distraction" that cannot address the severe starvation crisis. Agencies like the International Rescue Committee and UNRWA argue that airdrops are expensive, inefficient, and dangerous, and can never deliver the necessary volume of aid compared to land routes. They state that thousands of aid trucks are waiting for political will to open border crossings for safe and dignified access. The critique comes as the World Food Programme warns of mass starvation in the territory.</p>
