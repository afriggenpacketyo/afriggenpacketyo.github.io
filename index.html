          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is facing a sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York City, with his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura providing key testimony. Ventura detailed years of alleged psychological and physical abuse, including an instance of sexual assault after their breakup in 2018. A security video showing Combs attacking Ventura in 2016 is a central piece of evidence, although Combs' lawyers argue it shows a consensual relationship. The trial is expected to last eight to ten weeks, with several other accusers also expected to testify against Combs, who denies all allegations.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to remain elevated due to economic changes and policy uncertainties. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, which could pose challenges for both the economy and central banks. He cautioned that the era of near-zero interest rates is unlikely to return soon, emphasizing the Fed's reluctance to ease policy after previous rate cuts. While not directly mentioning President Trump's tariffs, Powell acknowledged their potential impact on slowing growth and boosting inflation.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding forecasts and signaling a potential turning point, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The growth was driven by increased consumer spending and business investment, although analysts caution that this strong rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. While the Labour government views the figures as encouraging, critics express concern over the impact of tax rises on economic progress. The Bank of England recently lowered interest rates, hinting at further cuts, though the stronger growth may temper market expectations.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case regarding the Trump administration's effort to narrow lower court orders that block the president's policies nationwide. The administration argues that district court judges lack the authority to issue injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. This fight over universal injunctions has intensified, with the Trump administration facing numerous legal challenges to its policies. Critics argue that limiting these injunctions would make it harder to challenge illegal government actions, while supporters say they undermine the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA plans to weaken limits on some 'forever chemicals' in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered. The EPA will give utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply with standards for PFOA and PFOS. Health advocates criticize the move, arguing it violates the Safe Water Drinking Act, while water utilities welcome the additional time for compliance.</p>

          <p>Endurance athlete Lewis Pugh is attempting to swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the importance of shark conservation. Pugh aims to change public perception of sharks, which he believes were unfairly maligned by the film "Jaws." He will swim for several hours each day in the cold waters, advocating for increased protection for these at-risk animals. This swim coincides with the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" and comes shortly after the first great white shark sighting of the season in Massachusetts.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent trade agreement between the United States and Britain, concerns persist among British consumers regarding American food production standards. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is working to counter the narrative that American meat is substandard. While the agreement aims to increase American agricultural exports to Britain, differences in food production practices, such as hormone treatment in beef and chlorine-washed chicken, pose challenges. British consumers prioritize food safety, animal welfare, and environmental protections, leading to resistance against relaxing food production standards.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales but cautioned that tariffs will soon lead to higher prices for consumers. CFO John David Rainey stated that even with reduced tariffs, the magnitude of the increases is too large for retailers to absorb. The company expects price hikes to begin later this month, with more significant increases in June. Despite the tariff pressures, Walmart beat quarterly earnings expectations and maintained its full-year forecast. The company is working with vendors to mitigate the impact of tariffs on consumers.</p>

          <p>Despite recent crackdowns, online scammer syndicates continue to expand their operations in Southeast Asia, relying on pre-existing criminal infrastructure and exploiting vulnerable individuals. The UNODC reports that these networks are constantly evolving, employing sophisticated techniques such as "pig butchering" scams. Singapore has taken measures to protect its citizens, but cross-border cooperation is essential to effectively combat these transnational crimes. A USIP report estimates that cyber scamming operations in Mekong countries generate as much as $44 billion annually, undermining governments and driving conflict.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis. Deaths declined across all major drug categories and in most states, with experts attributing the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply and increased access to treatment. Despite this progress, the Trump administration is proposing cuts to many federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, raising concerns about sustaining the momentum. In 2024, 80,391 people died from drug-related causes, still considered unacceptably high.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are divided over the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, creating a significant challenge for passing a $3.8 trillion tax proposal. Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California are demanding that the cap be raised or abolished, while others support a more modest increase. The SALT deduction has become a salient issue for voters in suburban districts, and the dispute is putting pressure on House leadership to find a compromise. A measure to raise the cap to $30,000 has been approved by the House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
