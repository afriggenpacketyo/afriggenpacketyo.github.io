          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has denounced reports that the White House considered offering administration jobs to his rivals, Mayor Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani described the alleged effort to clear the electoral field as a corrupt, backroom deal and an "affront to our democracy." The campaigns for both Adams and Sliwa have denied any such conversations took place, while Mamdani asserted that the news reveals an attempt to subvert the will of New York voters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its trade policy battle to the Supreme Court, appealing a federal court's decision that deemed most of its global "reciprocal tariffs" illegal. The lower court ruled that President Trump had overstepped his authority, stating that the power to impose tariffs rests exclusively with Congress. The administration is challenging this ruling to restore what it considers the president's lawful authority, setting up a significant legal confrontation over executive power in trade matters.</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary affirmed that allied nations are prepared to support Ukraine both before any potential peace deal and in securing its aftermath. This commitment to help make Ukraine's land, sea, and air safe comes as allies convene in Paris to discuss security guarantees. The pledge of long-term support stands in stark contrast to recent defiant statements from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has vowed to continue the invasion while mocking the idea of peace talks with President Zelensky.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that a majority of Americans continue to hold negative views of the U.S. economy, with most describing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling." These perceptions, which have dipped slightly in the last month, are primarily driven by persistent concerns over rising prices. Two-thirds of respondents reported that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so, overshadowing more positive economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from freezing nearly $2 billion in federal grants to Harvard University, ruling the action was unlawful. The judge found that the administration violated the university's First Amendment rights and used campus antisemitism as a "smokescreen" for a targeted, ideologically motivated assault on higher education. Harvard praised the ruling as a defense of academic freedom, while the White House announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A political disagreement between Senator Ted Cruz and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker devolved into a public exchange of personal insults. While criticizing Pritzker's opposition to using the National Guard in Chicago, Cruz made a joke about the governor's weight. Pritzker retaliated on social media by alluding to Cruz's widely publicized trip to Cancun during a severe winter storm in Texas, drawing significant public attention to the acrimonious spat.</p>

This perspective offers insight into the Chief Justice's strategy for navigating an era of intense political pressure on the judicial branch.</p>
