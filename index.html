          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced his government will pause its anti-tariff television advertisement in the United States, following President Trump's decision to halt trade talks. The ad, which used excerpts from a Ronald Reagan speech critical of tariffs, was intended to spark a conversation about their economic impact. Ford stated the campaign achieved its goal by reaching high-level U.S. audiences and will cease on Monday to allow negotiations to potentially resume. The tariffs have significantly impacted Ontario's auto-manufacturing industry.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are seeking to become the first MLB team to win back-to-back World Series championships since the New York Yankees' three-peat from 1998-2000. After sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, they are the first defending champion to return to the World Series in 16 years. They will face the Toronto Blue Jays, whose last championship was in 1993 when they themselves repeated as champions. Successfully defending a World Series title is a rare feat in baseball history, achieved by only seven franchises.</p>

          <p>Six men have been sentenced to prison for their roles in an arson attack on a London warehouse that was providing aid to Ukraine. The attack, which caused £1.3 million in damage, was ordered by the Russian state through the Wagner Group, a mercenary organization designated as a terrorist group by the UK. Ringleader Dylan Earl, who was also plotting to kidnap a Russian dissident, received a 17-year sentence. This case marks the first convictions under the UK's new National Security Act, designed to combat hostile state activities.</p>

          <p>As the European Union debates using frozen Russian central bank assets for Ukrainian war reparations, millions of private Russian investors find their own securities trapped in European depositories. These assets, held in institutions like Euroclear and Clearstream, were frozen when ties with Russia's National Settlement Depository were severed after the invasion. While these investors are not under sanctions, reclaiming their assets is a legally complex and expensive process, effectively locking out those with smaller holdings. Activists are calling for a simplified procedure to release these private funds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has terminated trade talks with Canada after Ontario's government aired a TV ad featuring a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan denouncing tariffs. President Trump criticized the ad on social media, calling it fraudulent, which prompted the suspension of negotiations. The dispute adds tension as both countries approach critical deadlines for the USMCA trade agreement review. Canadian officials have expressed readiness to resume talks while also focusing on developing new economic partnerships in Asia.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino has defended the tactics used during "Operation Midway Blitz," a campaign in Chicago to arrest undocumented migrants, calling his agents' use of force "exemplary." His comments come amid scrutiny over footage showing agents firing pepper balls into crowds, potentially violating a court order. Bovino asserted that all actions were within policy and necessary to prevent violence against federal officers. He also dismissed criticisms from Illinois Governor J.B.

          <p>With nearly one-third of S&P 500 companies having reported, the current earnings season is showing strong results, with a higher-than-average percentage of firms beating both revenue and profit estimates. Approximately 87% of companies have exceeded profit forecasts, compared to the historical average of 67%. This positive performance has contributed to a market rally, with investors largely shrugging off trade tensions with Canada and focusing on the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. However, the true test of the market will come next week when over 150 more companies report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown extends to its 24th day, approximately 750,000 furloughed employees are set to miss their first full paycheck. In response, various assistance programs have been established to help workers manage their bills. States with large federal workforces, like Maryland and Virginia, are offering housing protections and other resources. Additionally, several financial institutions, including Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA, are providing 0% APR loans to affected government employees. Nonprofit organizations like Feeding America are also mobilizing to provide food assistance during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>A German company, Böcker, has turned its product's involvement in a high-profile crime into a marketing opportunity. After thieves used one of its furniture lifts to access a second-story balcony during a $102 million jewel heist at the Louvre, the company launched an ad campaign featuring a picture of the machine at the scene. The tagline reads, "If you're in a hurry," highlighting the product's speed and quiet electric motor. The company's head of marketing decided to embrace the situation with humor, and the ad has since gone viral, garnering millions of views.</p>

          <p>Two men in southwestern Poland were injured when a World War II-era artillery shell they were handling exploded inside an apartment. One of the men had found the shell in a forest years ago and brought it home. Police, who were called after a window was seen blown out of the building, found both men and a woman under the influence of alcohol. A subsequent search of the apartment uncovered another unexploded device, a WWII mine, which was later neutralized by authorities. The incident prompted police to issue a public warning against touching or moving suspected unexploded ordnance.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban stated that eliminating billionaires would be impossible without also eliminating the stock market, an action he claims would "wipe out" the savings of most Americans. In a series of social media posts, Cuban argued that extreme wealth is an unavoidable consequence of a functioning market system that allows for investment and savings growth. He contended that even if all billionaire assets were seized, the funds would not be sufficient to cover major government expenses like the federal deficit's interest. He suggested the focus should be on creating opportunities for others to earn more. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel reported a return to profitability in the third quarter, ending a six-quarter streak of losses, driven by strong demand for its client computing chips used in PCs and laptops. This was the company's first earnings report since the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake. While the core chip business showed robust growth, the company's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other firms, saw a slight revenue decline and has yet to secure a major customer. Intel's cash position has significantly improved following recent investments, and the company noted surprisingly strong sales of its older-generation hardware. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homebuyers and homeowners are navigating a volatile mortgage rate environment influenced by inflation data, the government shutdown, and Federal Reserve policy. The average 30-year mortgage rate currently stands at 6.19%, having gradually declined throughout 2025 from a high of over 7% in January. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to announce another quarter-point interest rate cut on October 29, rates may see further downward pressure. However, rising inflation could complicate the Fed's future decisions, making the long-term rate trajectory uncertain for potential borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged over 30 individuals, including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, in a widespread gambling scandal linked to organized crime. The indictments allege schemes involving the use of inside player information for betting on games and rigging high-stakes poker games with cheating technology. The scandal highlights the complex and often fraught relationship between professional sports leagues and the legalized betting industry. This represents one of the most significant corruption crises to affect a major U.S. sports league since the broad legalization of sports wagering.</p>

          <p>A fourth Metropolitan Police officer, PC Jason Sinclair-Birt, has been dismissed for gross misconduct after being secretly filmed by a BBC Panorama investigation. The officer was recorded "boasting about and revelling in the use of force" on a detainee, providing a false account of the incident for what he claimed was "comedic effect." A disciplinary panel found his conduct breached professional standards, even though body-worn camera footage showed he did not use the level of force he described. Three other officers were also dismissed earlier in the week as a result of the same undercover report.</p>

Newsom asserted that the city is effectively managing crime, pointing to data showing a potential 70-year low in the homicide rate and an overall decline in violent crime. He also stated that a lawsuit was prepared and would be filed immediately if any such deployment were attempted. The president ultimately called off the plan after speaking with local leaders who assured him the city's situation was improving.</p>

          <p>After months of hesitation, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, just before the start of early voting. Jeffries' delay was notable, as Mamdani won the Democratic primary decisively and has secured support from most other major party figures. The endorsement came after Mamdani committed to being a "mayor for all New Yorkers," potentially easing concerns from the party's more moderate wing about his progressive policies. Mamdani remains the frontrunner against independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p>
