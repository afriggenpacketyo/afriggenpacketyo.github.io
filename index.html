          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year federal prison sentence of former congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release. Santos, convicted of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and misusing campaign funds, had served less than three months of his term. Trump justified the commutation by citing alleged mistreatment in solitary confinement and Santos's consistent Republican voting record, also noting a direct plea from Santos and advocacy from Republican allies. This controversial decision has drawn sharp criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, who argue that Santos's extensive pattern of fraud and deception warranted a much longer period of incarceration, raising concerns about accountability and the implications of such a presidential action.</p>

          <p>Stephen Bryant, a South Carolina man, is scheduled for execution on November 14 for a horrific 2004 murder where he burned the victim's eyes and taunted police by painting "catch me if u can" in blood. The state Supreme Court rejected his lawyers' request for a delay, despite the federal government shutdown impacting their work. Bryant, who confessed to killing Willard "TJ" Tietjen, is also suspected of fatally shooting two other men under similar circumstances. His defense cited severe childhood sexual abuse and subsequent drug use as factors that troubled him in the months leading up to the killings, painting a picture of a deeply disturbed individual.</p>

          <p>A Marine pilot from Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369, known as the “Gunfighters,” tragically died after his AH-1Z Viper helicopter crashed during a training mission in an unpopulated desert area of Imperial County, Southern California. The incident occurred on Thursday evening, with a second pilot transported to a medical center in stable condition. Major General James B. Wellons, commanding general of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, expressed profound sadness and offered condolences to the friends and family of the fallen Marine. The identity of the deceased is being withheld until 24 hours after his next of kin has been notified, as an investigation into the cause of this fatal training accident is now underway.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Allow National Guard Deployment in Illinois</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 21:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, seeking to overturn a lower court ruling that blocked the action. The Justice Department argues that federal agents in Chicago and the suburb of Broadview have faced repeated threats and assaults, necessitating military intervention to protect federal property and officers. This legal challenge is part of President Trump's broader strategy to expand the domestic use of the military in Democratic-led cities, which he portrays as dangerous and overwhelmed by unrest. However, Democratic officials and judges strongly oppose this, accusing Trump of misusing his authority for political gain and exaggerating local conditions to justify federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively developing its financial ecosystem to solidify its role as a leading offshore yuan trading center, introducing new measures to encourage greater international use of the Chinese currency. Initiatives like the Renminbi Bond Fund aim to make borrowing the yuan easier and more affordable for businesses, with Hong Kong dollar interest rates currently more than double those of mainland yuan loan rates. The scheme will expand in December to facilitate direct investments, allowing mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas investments and foreign firms to obtain yuan funding for mainland expansion. These strategic developments are designed to attract more international investors and companies, ultimately boosting Hong Kong's financial prominence and its connection to China's economy.

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, alongside 10% tariffs on all imported buses, including school and city buses. This protectionist measure aims to safeguard U.S. companies from foreign competitors and strongly incentivize domestic manufacturing within the United States. The administration will also provide a credit system for vehicle manufacturers who import some parts but then assemble the vehicles in the U.S., designed to offset any tariff liability. This program is intended to allow automakers building vehicles with American labor to remain cost-competitive and expand their production capacity within the country.</p>

          <p>Concerns about credit quality are rapidly rising among banks after regional lenders like Zions and Western Alliance disclosed significant, near-total losses from loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), citing alleged fraud. This situation has sent a collective shiver through global finance, prompting fears of broader contagion reminiscent of the 2023 banking crisis. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that "when you see one cockroach, there are probably more," highlighting potential hidden risks in this fast-growing loan category. While NDFI lending has soared to $1.14 trillion, analysts note its typically higher loss rates and quick onset of losses, making comprehensive risk assessment challenging, though some believe the recent stock selloff was an overreaction.

Liu, who joined the Red Army at 13 and rose through the ranks during two decades of war, was transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea.

A significant trend this year is a notable shift towards gold and silver as investments rather than just jewellery, reflected in rising bullion market data and record inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital gold. Furthermore, India's central bank is actively stocking up on gold to diversify its foreign exchange holdings and provide stability during geopolitical stress, reinforcing the metal's importance.

One intriguing theory suggests that recent changes to shipping fuels, which reduced sun-reflecting aerosols, might be contributing to the accelerated heating by removing a cooling effect. This extreme warmth could impact global weather patterns, potentially leading to a colder start to winter in the UK and supercharged thunderstorms in California due to increased atmospheric moisture.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has tentatively agreed to pay an additional $828 million to settle over 400 more sexual abuse claims against county employees, following a historic $4 billion settlement earlier this year. These claims, dating back decades and involving foster care and juvenile detention facilities, were enabled by a 2020 California law that suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault victims. The county emphasizes balancing its obligation to compensate victims with protecting taxpayers from fraud, as authorities investigate allegations of some plaintiffs being paid to file claims. Officials acknowledge the severe financial strain on the county, which has required cuts to critical programs, and are calling for "common sense fixes" to the law to mitigate future impacts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council publicly rebuked City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto, directing her to withdraw an attempt to halt a federal judge's order prohibiting LAPD officers from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. This rare and significant move came ahead of planned "No Kings" demonstrations against the Trump administration, emphasizing the council's stance on protecting press freedom. The judge's ban followed numerous legal claims from protesters and journalists alleging excessive force by LAPD during previous protests, including shooting individuals in sensitive body parts. Council members expressed deep frustration over the city attorney's independent legal filings, stressing the need for consultation as a legislative body and highlighting concerns about undermining First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The phrase "six, seven," originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," has become a mysterious viral classroom trend, baffling adults and sparking widespread glee among kids and teens. Despite its lack of explicit meaning, the phrase is shouted out randomly, often disrupting classes, leading some schools to attempt to ban it. The trend's unusual longevity is amplified by social media and, ironically, by teachers' efforts to suppress it, as middle-schoolers enjoy provoking adult reactions. Experts suggest "six, seven" serves as a generational code word, making kids feel part of an "in crowd" and perhaps representing a lighthearted way for them to express fun amidst societal pressures.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has indicted former National Security Adviser John Bolton on 18 counts, alleging he systematically shared over 1,000 pages of classified information with relatives to compile a tell-all book. Prosecutors claim Bolton used a group chat as a primary vehicle for these transmissions, even texting recipients to keep the content secret. While Bolton argues this prosecution is political retribution, the article suggests the case is "righteous" given the detailed allegations and the potential compromise of classified data. This is particularly concerning after a hacked email account containing diary entries was reportedly accessed by the government of Iran, raising serious national security implications.</p>

Benioff, whose stance marked a shift from his past liberal policy support, clarified that his remarks came from "an abundance of caution" and emphasized the importance of community partnership for progress. His apology followed Trump's continued rhetoric about rampant crime in liberal cities, claims which San Francisco's mayor and law enforcement leaders strongly dispute, citing declining crime rates.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-China trade war continues to be characterized by "shock tactics," including blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and unpredictable on-again-off-again meetings between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping. Experts and former officials suggest this volatile dynamic is a direct consequence of disregarding established diplomatic norms, leading to frequent misinterpretations and escalations between the two nations. Recent examples include Trump's new tariffs following Beijing's expanded export controls on strategic rare earth minerals, which were themselves a response to Washington's increased sanctions on blacklisted firms. This persistent cycle of retaliatory measures and a lack of clear communication are seen as significantly undermining any chances of a stable resolution to the ongoing trade dispute.</p>

Acosta argued that Epstein's imprisonment and sex offender registration sent a strong societal signal that such behavior was unacceptable. He denied consulting Donald Trump about the deal and expressed unawareness that Epstein would receive work release, stating that knowledge would have prevented the agreement from going forward.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals highly promising results for the Galleri blood test, which can detect over 50 types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis and treatment. Trials in North America demonstrated the test's ability to identify a wide range of cancers, three-quarters of which currently lack any form of screening program, with more than half detected at an early, more treatable stage. The test works by identifying minute fragments of cancerous DNA circulating in the blood, and impressively, it correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative. While the results are compelling, scientists emphasize that more evidence from large-scale randomized studies, like the ongoing NHS trial, is needed to confirm if this earlier detection truly translates into reduced cancer deaths.</p>
