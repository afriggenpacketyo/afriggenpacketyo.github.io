            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, the Chinese government has instructed its domestic airlines to cease accepting deliveries of Boeing jets and to halt the purchase of airline parts from U.S. companies. This directive comes after China increased retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, matching the levels imposed by President Trump. Boeing, which was slated to ship approximately ten 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, declined to comment on the matter, while its shares experienced a decline in morning trading, reflecting investor concerns over the potential impact of this trade dispute. This action underscores the deepening economic conflict between the two nations and its potential ramifications for global aviation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) shares experienced a nearly 5% surge after Elliott Investment Management acquired a stake exceeding $1.5 billion in the server maker. Elliott, an activist investor, aims to engage HPE in discussions on enhancing shareholder value, although neither party has officially commented on the news. Despite exceeding quarterly revenue expectations last month, HPE issued a weak fiscal full-year guidance, citing challenges related to higher discounting and anticipated price adjustments impacting top-line growth.

            <p>Treasury yields exhibited stability after a period of volatility in the bond market, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slightly decreasing to 4.343%. This follows a week of significant fluctuations that saw the 10-year Treasury yield surge by over 50 basis points, fueled by concerns about President Trump's tariff policies. Analysts suggest that potential factors contributing to the sell-off in Treasuries include debt concerns, hedge fund activity, and worries about foreign holdings of U.S. government debt, particularly by China, which is America's second-largest foreign creditor. These factors collectively influence the bond market's dynamics and investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

The dispute stems from the council's decision to eliminate Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles, leading to rejected pay offers and concerns over potential wage cuts. While negotiations continue, residents are facing increasing frustrations due to uncollected waste piling up in the streets.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel, expressing caution over future Chinese investment in the steel industry, deeming it a 'sensitive sector'. This decision followed accusations that the company's Chinese owner, Jingye, planned to halt operations at the Scunthorpe plant, prompting concerns about the UK's ability to produce virgin steel. The government secured vital raw materials to keep the plant running and is exploring potential private investors while not ruling out nationalization. The intervention highlights the strategic importance of the steel industry and the government's commitment to safeguarding it amid global economic challenges.</p>

            <p>Despite the immediate economic shock of President Trump's tariffs, Beijing views the trade war with the U.S. as a potential catalyst for accelerating China's technological advancement and domestic market integration. According to a Chinese economic official, the tariffs compel China to strengthen its innovation capacity and build a fully integrated domestic economic circulation system. This perspective suggests that the trade war, while challenging in the short term, could ultimately benefit China by fostering self-reliance and technological independence. Beijing has vowed to "fight until the end" and has matched each round of tariffs imposed by Washington.</p>

            <p>According to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey, President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring supply chains back to the U.S., as most companies find the costs prohibitive, with over half citing cost as the primary reason. Instead, many companies plan to relocate supply chains to lower-tariff countries, with 61% finding this more cost-effective. The survey also reveals that 61% of respondents feel the Trump administration is bullying corporate America. These findings suggest that tariffs may not achieve the intended goal of reshoring manufacturing and could lead to further shifts in global supply chain dynamics.</p>

He criticizes the administration's policies as both an economic and strategic blunder that could have significant long-term costs for the United States.

            <p>Citigroup reported first-quarter results that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by strong revenue from fixed income and equities trading. Profit rose 21% to $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, while revenue climbed 3% to $21.60 billion. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the bank's continued efforts to earn credibility with investors and execute its strategy. The firm's fixed income traders generated $4.5 billion in revenue, while equities traders saw revenue rise 23% to $1.5 billion, benefiting from heightened market volatility and increased client activity.

            <p>When reviewing former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe's phone to preserve messages from his Signal application, a CIA official was unable to locate any "substantive messages," finding only administrative content. The declaration comes after concerns were raised about settings on officials' phones potentially triggering the autodeletion of messages. Officials were able to successfully preserve messages from the devices of other officials. This raises questions about transparency and record-keeping practices within government agencies.</p>

            <p>A Michigan man, Joshua Lowe, has been sentenced to eight months in prison for sending a false bomb threat to a Carnival Cruise Lines ship after becoming upset that his girlfriend went on the cruise without him. The email prompted a search of over a thousand staterooms and alerted the U.S. Coast Guard and Jamaican authorities. Lowe admitted to sending the message because he was upset that the family went on the cruise while leaving him behind to care for their pets. He will also be required to pay restitution for expenses associated with the hoax.</p>

            <p>Teachers in England are moving closer to strike action after the National Education Union (NEU) announced it would hold a formal ballot if the government's pay offer for the next school year remains "unacceptable." The government has recommended a 2.8% pay rise for teachers, expecting schools to fund it through "efficiencies." The NEU seeks a higher pay rise and additional funding to avoid schools having to cut from existing budgets. Previous strike action by NEU members in 2023 forced many schools to close, and further action could occur in the autumn term if an agreement is not reached.</p>

The UN has warned of a worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, with aid blockades exacerbating the crisis.
