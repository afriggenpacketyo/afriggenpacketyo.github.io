          <p>The Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., highlighted artisans dedicated to preserving their cultural traditions for future generations. Featured participants included a Guatemalan Maya painter, Bolivian rappers integrating indigenous languages into hip-hop, and refugee weavers from the Karen ethnic group. The event also showcased a family of Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for stars like Dolly Parton, continuing a craft passed down through four generations. These artists shared their skills and stories, emphasizing the importance of youth mentorship in keeping their heritage alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China and Japan have engaged in a war of words following recent close encounters between their military aircraft over the East China Sea. Japan's defense ministry accused a Chinese fighter jet of making "unusual approaches" toward one of its electronic-intelligence planes, warning such actions could lead to accidental collisions. In response, China's defence ministry claimed its forces acted lawfully and professionally while monitoring Japanese aircraft that repeatedly entered its air defense identification zone. Beijing asserted that Japan's reconnaissance and "harassment" are the primary cause of maritime and air security risks in the region.</p>

          <p>A child has died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, marking what is believed to be only the second such death in the UK in a decade. The hospital reported a significant increase in seriously unwell children with the virus, treating 17 cases since June. Health officials attribute the surge to falling uptake of the MMR vaccine, with vaccination rates in Liverpool at 73%, well below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization. The UK Health Security Agency warns that measles is highly contagious and can lead to serious complications or death.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring additional measures to enhance online safety for children, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. This comes as new age-verification rules, enforced by the regulator Ofcom, are set to take effect, requiring platforms to filter harmful content from children's feeds. Alexander stated these rules are a foundation, not the final step, and that the Technology Secretary is examining further actions to address issues like addictive online habits. While Ofcom has pledged rigorous enforcement, its chief executive acknowledged that new legal powers might be necessary to address challenges posed by advancing AI.</p>

          <p>A year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, which resulted in the death of firefighter Corey Comperatore, focus remains on the systemic security failures of the U.S. Secret Service. Multiple investigations identified lapses in intelligence sharing and event coordination, prompting 37 reform measures from the agency. Experts trace some of these issues to the post-9/11 restructuring that expanded the Secret Service's mission without a proportional increase in resources, leading to staffing challenges. While the bravery of individual agents is praised, questions persist about whether the agency has the support needed to fulfill its "zero-fail" mission.</p>

          <p>The assassination attempt on Donald Trump one year ago profoundly altered the US political landscape, cementing his image as a resilient fighter and contributing to the eventual withdrawal of Joe Biden from the presidential race. Trump's defiant reaction, raising a bloodied fist to the crowd, created a powerful political narrative that his supporters viewed as evidence of divine protection. The event, combined with Biden's subsequent health issues and exit from the race, created a "devastating split screen" that highlighted Trump's perceived strength. This pivotal week continues to influence American politics, fueling a narrative of destiny around Trump's presidency.</p>

An Indian minister recently stated that only the Dalai Lama and his established institution have the authority to identify his successor, a comment that was followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled leader. Beijing responded with formal protests, insisting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition, and accusing India of interfering in its domestic affairs.

These remotely controlled jellyfish can be directed to swim and collect environmental data on temperature and pressure, offering a low-cost, scalable alternative to traditional underwater robots. Jellyfish are ideal for this purpose as they lack a central nervous system, feel no pain, and have remarkable regenerative abilities. The team aims to make ocean research more accessible and is working on deep-sea versions of the device, potentially revolutionizing how marine data is collected.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing crisis, California is creating a new cabinet-level agency dedicated solely to housing and homelessness. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, splits the former Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency to elevate the focus on one of the state's most pressing issues. Supporters believe this reorganization is long overdue and will help streamline the state's complex network of affordable housing funding programs. However, critics question whether a bureaucratic reshuffle will be effective, especially since major funding sources managed by the state treasurer's office remain separate, posing a continued challenge.</p>

          <p>After a four-decade conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has initiated a disarmament process, signaling a potential end to its armed struggle against the Turkish government. The move, which began with a ceremonial destruction of weapons, is seen as an opportunity for reconciliation, though the PKK's full disarmament is contingent on concessions from Ankara, including the release of leader Abdullah Ocalan. While Turkey's government remains cautious, a parliamentary commission is being formed to address the peace process. A successful resolution could significantly boost Turkey's regional influence by improving relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging economic climate in China, some luxury hotels are resorting to unconventional methods to stay afloat, including selling street food. The five-star Zhongwu Hotel in Changzhou, for example, has started offering budget-friendly boxed meals prepared by its high-end catering team, with prices ranging from just 20 to 100 yuan. This strategy reflects a broader trend where high-end establishments must adapt to shifting consumer behavior and economic pressures. The move from serving expensive banquets to selling popular night market fare highlights the severity of the business challenges they face. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, the 1985 Live Aid concert is remembered as a landmark moment of global unity and fundraising, but its legacy is also viewed with modern criticism. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to combat famine in Ethiopia, the event raised millions and put humanitarian issues on the global political agenda. However, looking back, the concert is criticized for its lack of diversity, featuring almost no African or female performers, and for promoting a "white savior" narrative of Africa. While Geldof defends the event's impact, others argue it reinforced patronizing stereotypes that persist in the development sector today.</p>

          <p>The US Attorney General has ordered the dismissal of all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore Jr., a Utah plastic surgeon accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccines and distributing fake vaccination cards. Dr. Moore had been indicted under the Biden administration for allegedly destroying vaccines worth $28,000, providing fraudulent records for a fee, and giving children saline shots instead of the vaccine. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the charges were dropped because Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice" and did not deserve to face prison time.

          <p>Campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic ingredient lists to be in English instead of Latin to protect consumers with allergies. The current system uses the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), which relies on Latin-based scientific names that are difficult for the public to understand, such as "Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis" for sweet almond oil. This creates a risk for individuals with severe allergies, who may unknowingly use a harmful product. While the industry association argues the system provides global consistency, advocates maintain that clear, plain-language labeling is essential for safety.</p>

His aggressive, high-energy press has become the starting point for PSG's suffocating style of play, forcing opponent errors and creating scoring opportunities.
