          <p>The husband of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza, whose nine children were killed in an Israeli strike, remains in critical condition. The Israeli military has stated that the incident is under review. The Red Cross reported that two of its staff members were also killed in a strike. The hospital is doing everything they can for the husband, who sustained significant injuries to his brain, lungs, right arm, and kidney in the attack, and the couple's surviving son was also injured. This article highlights the ongoing civilian death toll in Gaza and the immense suffering faced by families. The author's tone reflects the tragic circumstances.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuel projects, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. This investment strategy, dubbed the "Japanese model," allows Japan to secure access to LNG for domestic use and resell surplus LNG, transforming the country from a consumer to an exporter. While Japan promotes the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) to foster cooperation on net-zero emissions, many of its projects focus on natural gas and carbon capture storage, with LNG considered a "transitional fuel." Critics argue that LNG is more emissions-intensive than coal and that Japan's approach constitutes greenwashing (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert introduces a new framework called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This style encourages parents to accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view "bad" behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. It involves doing internal work, creating a safe environment for expressing emotions, embracing the whole child, and leading with calm authority. The author suggests that emotional safety is often missing in homes because parents were not taught how to create a safe space during emotional storms.</p>

          <p>This article remembers Julie Moore, an Army spouse who played a pivotal role in changing the military's casualty notification system. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore led a campaign to ensure that families were notified in person and offered support. Her efforts led to a significant change in Army culture, with service members now personally delivering the news and providing assistance to grieving families. The story highlights her compassion and dedication to supporting military families.</p>

Critics argue that councils are prioritizing revenue from drivers over addressing environmental issues.
