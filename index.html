          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a drop of approximately 15% following the company's announcement of an $850 million share sale. The company intends to allocate these funds towards infrastructure development and the implementation of an AI-based aviation software platform. Archer also plans to use the capital to support its Launch Edition program, which includes a partnership to provide air taxi services during the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The company's CEO, Adam Goldstein, stated that Archer now possesses the strongest balance sheet in the sector, enabling them to execute their plans both in the U.S. and internationally. Optimism surrounds the company's prospects as they gear up to display their Midnight eVTOL aircraft at the Paris Air Show, with the United Arab Emirates as their first launch market.</p>

          <p>Tensions escalated between Israel and Iran as Israel launched airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders, leading to retaliatory missile and drone attacks from Iran. Israel's military reported intercepting numerous missiles with its Iron Dome defense system, while U.S. forces aided in intercepting Iranian missiles. The Israeli operation, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," aimed to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities and eliminate key Iranian security leaders, according to Israeli officials. Iran responded with missile strikes, prompting warnings of further action and heightening concerns about a wider regional conflict. NATO urged de-escalation, while the U.S. emphasized its non-involvement in Israel's strikes and cautioned Iran against targeting U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>The Strait of Hormuz remains open for commercial traffic following Israel's attack on Iran, but maritime experts anticipate ongoing risks and increased caution from ship owners. Some shipowners are reportedly avoiding the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, potentially leading to slowdowns or closures. Maritime security firms are advising companies to prepare for rerouting and to assess vessel affiliations for potential targeting. BIMCO has recommended implementing ship defense measures and reconsidering current routing, with the U.S. Joint Maritime Information Center emphasizing the importance of reviewing contingency plans. Insurance costs for ships, cargo, and crew are expected to rise, and potential disruptions could cause spikes in ocean freight container shipping rates.</p>

          <p>CBS News provides an overview of debt settlement, a strategy that allows borrowers to negotiate with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed. The process involves stopping payments to creditors and saving money in a dedicated account while a debt relief company negotiates on the borrower's behalf. Debt settlement is typically suited for individuals with significant unsecured debt who are already behind on payments. While it can offer relief, it also comes with risks, including credit damage, fees, and potential tax consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News analyzes the costs of borrowing $100,000 through a home equity loan versus a home equity line of credit (HELOC) in the current economic climate.

The article advises homeowners to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and consult with a home equity lending expert. It highlights the importance of assessing affordability in both the short and long term, given the risk of foreclosure if repayments cannot be met. (not investment advice)</p>
