          <p>Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Israel initiated a preemptive strike against Iran, leading to a state of emergency and air raid sirens in Tel Aviv. Katz stated that a missile and drone attack against Israel and its civilian population is expected imminently, prompting heightened alert levels. The United States has stated they did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike. The situation remains tense as both nations brace for further escalation, with potential regional and international implications.

          <p>The People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily fixing rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months, reaching 7.1772 per US dollar. This move followed a drop in the US dollar index after the May producer price index fell below expectations, leading traders to anticipate more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Concerns over US tariff policies and debt sustainability have also contributed to the dollar's weakness. Despite a recent trade talk truce between China and the US, some analysts remain cautious about future economic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are suggesting that the recent decline in "white collar" job openings is due to structural issues within the economy, rather than artificial intelligence taking over these roles. The professional and business services sector has experienced a decrease in hiring activity over the past two years, while industries like healthcare and construction have seen growth. Experts emphasize that AI technology is still in its early stages and cannot execute key skills without human intervention. While AI may transform jobs in the future, it is not currently the primary driver behind the decline in white-collar job creation. The technology has a ways to go before it poses a serious threat to the job market.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that would have compelled President Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California Governor Gavin Newsom. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals paused the order after an appeal by the Trump administration, with a hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Judge Charles Breyer had previously ruled that the deployment of the Guard exceeded Trump's authority and was against the law. The White House called Breyer's order unprecedented and claimed it endangered federal officials. The debate on state versus federal power is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Klara Dobrev, a Hungarian MEP, spoke about the rise of illiberal democracy in Europe, drawing parallels between Hungary and the United States. Dobrev emphasized that democracies should not be taken for granted and warned against complacency. She highlighted how illiberal leaders attack institutions, checks and balances, media, and freedom of speech. Dobrev believes that a broad coalition of Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, Greens, Social Democrats, and Socialists is necessary to defeat illiberal populists, and that European funding without proper controls has enabled the rise of illiberalism in Hungary.

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military commanders, and research scientists, while Iran retaliated with drone strikes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the goal was to "roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival," while IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin claimed the attack was preemptive due to an uncovered Iranian plan to destroy Israel. Iranian officials quickly threatened retaliation, and the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place. The attacks have cast doubt on the fate of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, with potential implications for regional stability. This conflict could escalate to be among the most severe clashes between Israel and Iran.</p>

Padilla interrupted the briefing, which focused on immigration enforcement, to ask questions, leading to his removal by Secret Service and FBI agents. The incident has sparked condemnation from Democratic members of Congress, who called the arrest an affront to democracy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, experts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. The strait sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Analysts argue that impeding oil passage would not benefit Iran, especially given that its oil infrastructure has not been directly targeted, and it could trigger further retaliation. Additionally, China, Iran's largest oil customer, would likely oppose such a move, as it relies on the Strait for its oil imports. The action could be more of a bane than a boon for Tehran.</p>

Monbiot argues that the film is a step in the right direction but that the fishing industry's destructive practices are often overlooked. He suggests reversing the presumption, with protection as the default position and limited fishing activities permitted only in the least fragile areas, managed by local communities. Monbiot criticizes the government's financial support of the fishing industry, arguing that it costs more than it makes and that greater protection of marine areas is needed.

Low-income enrollees would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums, while middle-income enrollees would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all.

Democrats are exploring online spaces like YouTube, Reddit, and Discord to engage with young men. It is a challenge for the party.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., sent a document to Congress with 'medical disinformation' to defend a policy change on COVID vaccines. The document cites unpublished or disputed studies and mischaracterizes others, according to health experts. The document was meant to support Kennedy's decision to remove recommendations for COVID vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children. Medical experts say the HHS document distorts studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished. The situation has raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of information provided to lawmakers. It is a controversial issue.</p>

          <p>An article highlights the story of Pastor Billy in Zambia, who frantically searched for HIV medication for Diana, an AIDS orphan, after U.S. foreign aid was frozen. Diana's HIV clinic closed, and her monthly food package stopped, leaving her without critical support. The situation underscores the impact of PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has supported millions of orphans and vulnerable children. The aid freeze has left many families with orphans hungry and without access to essential resources, raising concerns about the future of HIV/AIDS efforts in affected countries. It is a reminder of the importance of foreign aid.</p>

          <p>Israel launched air strikes into Iran, targeting the country's nuclear program and prompting Iranian retaliatory strikes. The Israeli strikes killed top Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists ahead of planned negotiations in Oman. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had targeted Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. Following Israel's initial attacks, the country said its air force conducted "a large-scale strike" against Iranian air defenses in the west of Iran. The US has warned it would not tolerate an Iranian nuclear weapons program but said it was not involved in the Israeli attack on Iran. The future remains unclear.</p>

          <p>India is seeking to tap into its rare earth reserves to become an alternative to China, which currently dominates the global supply. The move comes as many countries grapple with Beijing's restrictions on rare earth element exports. Experts say India could become an important alternative to China in the sector, but will require much more public and private investment. India has the world's third-largest share of rare earth reserves, but it lacks advanced separation and refining technology. The report comes just days after India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports of rare earth elements a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative.</p>
