          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 02:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is expanding duty-free access for products from 53 African nations, a move seen as a significant diplomatic and economic victory. This policy contrasts sharply with recent U.S. actions, which include imposing higher tariffs, cutting foreign aid, and implementing restrictive visa measures for several African countries. Observers note that these developments are leading African nations to increasingly view China as a more reliable and beneficial international partner. The U.S. assumption that its humanitarian aid would guarantee goodwill is proving to be outdated in the face of these strategic shifts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a large-scale recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall effort was initiated by citizens angry over the KMT and its allies blocking key legislation, including the defense budget, and passing reforms seen as favoring mainland China. The outcome could potentially shift the legislative majority back to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which currently holds a minority. The KMT has framed the recalls as political retaliation, intensifying tensions over the island's democratic integrity and relationship with Beijing.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that dopamine agonist drugs, prescribed for conditions like Parkinson's disease, are causing extreme and harmful side effects, including compulsive gambling and hypersexuality. The article details a case where a man's medication led him to spy on his wife and develop obsessive behaviors, ultimately tearing his family apart. Despite drug manufacturers being aware of links to "deviant" sexual behavior for years, warnings on patient leaflets remain vague. The BBC has been contacted about 50 similar cases, highlighting a serious issue of patients not being adequately informed about these life-altering risks.</p>

          <p>A strike by employees of Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, is causing garbage to pile up in cities across the United States. The Teamsters union, representing the workers, is demanding better pay and benefits, citing the high cost of living. The dispute, which began in the Boston area, has spread to several other states, impacting millions of residents and causing public health concerns due to rotting waste. While some local disputes have been resolved, others remain at a stalemate, with municipalities suing the company for breach of contract.</p>

          <p>Three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies were killed when a grenade they had recovered from a Santa Monica apartment complex detonated at a training facility. The deputies believed the explosive was inert and had stored it overnight before the fatal explosion occurred. A second grenade recovered from the same location is now missing, prompting a large-scale search by the ATF and LASD. Sheriff Robert Luna described the event as the department's largest loss of life since 1857 and announced that all explosive devices will now be treated as live, changing departmental policy to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a stark warning that almost a third of Gaza's population is going days without eating, and 90,000 women and children urgently need treatment for malnutrition.

In response to mounting international pressure, Israel has indicated it may allow aid airdrops, a method aid agencies consider inefficient.

          <p>A salon owner in Leicester is preparing for a key intellectual property hearing in her long-running trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the salon 'nkd', is fighting to re-register her business's trademark, which L'Oréal opposes. The French firm argues that 'nkd' is too similar to its 'Naked' line of products by Urban Decay and would cause consumer confusion. After spending over £30,000 in legal fees and facing significant delays, Dowdeswell says she feels ready to continue her fight against the corporate giant.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that at least 245 soldiers aged 18 have been killed in Ukraine, despite President Putin's promises not to send young conscripts to the front. A change in Russian law in April 2023 allows school-leavers to sign professional army contracts immediately, bypassing mandatory service. Attracted by large cash bonuses and patriotic propaganda in schools, these teenagers are enlisting voluntarily. The report highlights the story of one such soldier, killed just 20 days after enlisting, illustrating the human cost of a system that recruits vulnerable and naive young men for the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a thriving population of certain insects, including butterflies, ladybirds, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions caused a boom in aphids, which in turn provided an abundant food source for their predators like ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation reported an "extraordinary" year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to the record low numbers of the previous year. However, experts caution that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to drying wetland habitats.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents illegally thwarted federal enforcement efforts. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that the policies do not improperly regulate ICE operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and the Illinois governor praised the ruling, stating that it affirms the city's right to focus its law enforcement resources on local needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the history and impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It showcases how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals like Ronald Reagan to name names, and extended beyond Hollywood to affect ordinary Americans. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and the protection of democracy.</p>

          <p>A Whittier man has been arrested and charged with wire fraud for allegedly conning multiple people he met on dating apps like Tinder and Hinge out of more than $2 million. Prosecutors allege that between 2021 and 2024, Christopher Earl Lloyd lied about his wealth and investment expertise to convince victims to give him money for fake investment opportunities. He allegedly created fake contracts and return schedules to perpetuate the scheme. Authorities say he used the fraudulently obtained funds for personal expenses, including making a $40,000 payment on a Lexus.</p>

          <p>A feature article examines Donald Trump's unique relationship with golf, portraying it as a business venture, a networking tool, and a fiercely competitive pursuit, rather than just a leisurely pastime. The article notes that for Trump, who owns numerous courses worldwide, golf has served as a way to forge connections with politicians and foreign leaders, often in private settings away from media scrutiny. While his passion for the game is clear, his conduct on the course, including claims of cheating, is also discussed. The piece suggests that for those interacting with him, a tee time is often a transactional opportunity.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity for her recent nine-hour interview with the Department of Justice. This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors are seeking cooperation. Maxwell, who is appealing her 20-year sex trafficking sentence, reportedly initiated the meetings. The development is highly unusual given her conviction and the high rank of the official involved, occurring amid political pressure for more transparency on the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists is working to rescue the bighorn sheep population in Texas, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a major conservation effort, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd to a new, isolated mountain range. A recent follow-up visit confirmed the mission's success, as the relocated herd has survived and is now growing with the birth of new lambs, offering hope for the species' future in the state.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with President Trump's special envoy stating the U.S. team is returning home for consultations. The envoy blamed Hamas, saying its response showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire." The talks are deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal for hostage release and Israel's refusal to end the war until Hamas is disarmed. This diplomatic failure occurs as the U.N. and other agencies report a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with children starving to death and a massive increase in acute malnutrition.</p>

          <p>A recent article explores whether people need to be strict about common health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water or taking 10,000 steps a day. Experts suggest there is often wriggle room; for instance, the body's thirst mechanism is a reliable guide for hydration for most healthy individuals. However, when it comes to sleep, specialists are firm on the need for seven to nine hours for long-term health, citing risks of obesity, diabetes, and lower mortality. The consensus is that while benchmarks are useful guides, a balanced and consistent approach to overall health is more important than rigidly hitting every number.</p>
