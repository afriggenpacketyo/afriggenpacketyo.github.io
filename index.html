          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal facilities, specifically an ICE office he claims is under siege from 'Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.' The president stated he has authorized the use of 'full force' if necessary, escalating his administration's response to protests. Oregon's Democratic governor and senators, along with Portland's mayor, have strongly condemned the move, calling it an unnecessary and authoritarian action intended to provoke conflict rather than maintain peace in the city.</p>

Hinson condemned the content as inappropriate indoctrination, stating schools should focus on education, not promoting sexual identities to minors without parental consent. The Linn-Mar Community School District has responded by launching its own review to determine if any policies were violated, while affirming its commitment to a safe and inclusive environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart, a mystery that has long captivated the public. The order follows a request from a Republican lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, who cited 'credible, firsthand accounts' of Earhart being seen on Saipan. While the prevailing theory is that Earhart's plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean, other speculative theories, including that she was a spy captured by the Japanese, have persisted for decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. media reports, the FBI has dismissed between 15 and 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during racial justice protests in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. The termination letters allegedly cited a 'lack of judgement,' sparking condemnation from the FBI Agents Association, which claims the agents' rights were violated. This action is seen as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to remove what it considers 'woke' influences from federal agencies, though proponents of the agents' actions argue kneeling was a de-escalation tactic.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace defeated Liverpool 2-1 in a thrilling Premier League match, with substitute Eddie Nketiah scoring the winning goal in the 97th minute. Palace dominated the first half but only managed one goal from Ismaila Sarr, while Liverpool's defense appeared chaotic and vulnerable. After Federico Chiesa equalized for Liverpool late in the game, Nketiah's last-gasp strike secured a historic win for Palace, extending their unbeaten streak to 18 games and moving them to second place in the league table, highlighting Liverpool's underlying frailties this season.</p>

          <p>Analysts observe that President Trump's strategy of openly acknowledging or boasting about actions that would have been career-ending scandals for past presidents has altered public perception of political corruption. By being brazen about controversial conduct, such as pressuring the Justice Department or mixing business with his presidency, he often avoids the typical fallout from such revelations. This approach, combined with a constant flood of crises, desensitizes the public and allows him to frame his actions as authentic and anti-establishment, rather than corrupt.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis has become central to the fight against AI-generated pornography after discovering a man had used their social media photos to create explicit deepfakes on a 'nudify' website. Their experience exposed a legal gray area, as creating the images for personal use without distributing them may not be illegal in many jurisdictions. This has spurred them to advocate for new legislation, leading to a proposed Minnesota bill that would hold AI companies accountable for enabling the creation of such nonconsensual content.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup victory was built on a deliberate effort to foster a positive and inclusive team environment, a departure from the reportedly stressful 2022 campaign.

This focus on unity and presence, summed up by the mantra 'be where our feet are,' helped the team manage the pressure of being both hosts and heavy favorites on their way to lifting the trophy.</p>
