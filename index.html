          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area, including New York City and Connecticut. This marks the second seismic event in the state in under two weeks, following a series of smaller quakes near Morris Plains. No damage was reported from the recent tremor, though it follows a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2024 that was felt by millions. The article notes that the region's Ramapo Fault line produces several minor quakes annually, with the state's strongest recorded earthquake being a 5.3 magnitude event in 1783.</p>

          <p>Recent cross-border attacks between Russia and Ukraine have impacted civilian areas and key infrastructure. A Russian missile strike in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv injured at least three people and damaged homes. Concurrently, Ukrainian forces reportedly launched a drone attack that caused a large fire at an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, leading to flight suspensions at the local airport. These incidents are part of a series of weekend strikes, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling for stronger international sanctions against Russia following an earlier deadly assault on Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Germany is strengthening its military support for Ukraine by directly financing the production of long-range combat drones within Ukraine itself. This strategic shift in military-industrial cooperation aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities, allowing it to strike targets deeper inside Russian territory. The agreement includes funding for approximately 500 An-196 Liutyi attack drones, with German arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall expanding their operations in the country. This collaboration not only provides Ukraine with much-needed weaponry but also serves as a real-world testing ground for advanced German military technology, enhancing its effectiveness against electronic warfare.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article asserts that the US and Israeli military strikes against Iran 50 days prior have failed to achieve their objectives and have produced negative consequences. The author, Simon Tisdall, argues that Iran's nuclear program continues, and the regime, far from collapsing, has become more defiant and intensified its crackdown on political dissent, with a rising number of executions. The piece contends the attacks have undermined international law, deepened geopolitical rifts, and ironically may have increased the likelihood of Iran developing a nuclear weapon for self-defense. It concludes by calling for a diplomatic path forward, including regional nuclear pact negotiations.</p>

          <p>Argentinian football star Lionel Messi was forced to exit an Inter Miami Leagues Cup match against Necaxa after sustaining an injury early in the game. The incident occurred in the 11th minute, and after receiving attention from trainers, Messi limped off the field with what was later described as hamstring discomfort. The 38-year-old team captain has faced several fitness issues since joining the MLS club in 2023. The severity of the current injury is yet to be determined, but it adds to concerns about his durability during his tenure with the team.</p>

This article focuses on a group of mothers in Maceió, the epicenter of the outbreak, who have formed a powerful support network, even moving into the same housing complex to help one another. Despite being largely forgotten by the public, these women have successfully lobbied for increased government compensation to help cover the extensive costs of care. The story highlights their resilience and the uncertain future, as scientists still do not fully understand why the outbreak ceased or if it could resurface.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has departed for its August recess without reaching a bipartisan agreement to advance dozens of President Donald Trump's nominees. Negotiations between Republicans and Democrats broke down, with Democrats blocking fast-track votes and forcing lengthy roll calls for each nominee. The stalemate was punctuated by a social media post from President Trump telling Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL!" and rejecting a potential deal. In response to the gridlock, some Republicans have suggested they may seek to change Senate rules to expedite confirmations when they return in September.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough's latest BBC series, "Parenthood," documents the extraordinary lengths to which animal parents go to raise their young. The show features compelling and sometimes shocking examples of parental sacrifice, such as the African social spider mother who is consumed by her offspring. The series director highlights the use of advanced cinematography to capture these intimate moments non-intrusively, from poison dart frogs carrying tadpoles up trees to orangutans spending a decade teaching their young. At 99 years old, Attenborough continues to provide his iconic narration, telling stories that connect with universal themes of parenting and adapting to a changing world.</p>

This article explores the phenomenon, noting how many influencers promote achieving the look safely by using fake tan products to create sharp, contrasting lines on the skin. However, it also highlights a dangerous counter-trend where individuals intentionally sunburn themselves to create real tan lines, posting the painful results online. The piece strongly contrasts these approaches by featuring the story of a young man who survived melanoma after being addicted to sunbeds, serving as a stark reminder of the severe risks associated with UV exposure.</p>

The expert described the border issue as a solvable political matter that could be addressed with Russia acting as an ally.

          <p>The brutal arrest of a Black college student, William McNeil Jr., in Florida has sparked an investigation and a discussion on the value of citizen-recorded video. McNeil's dashboard-mounted cellphone captured a unique interior view of his traffic stop, showing an officer smashing his window and punching him, details not clearly visible in police bodycam footage. Civil rights attorneys argue this footage provides crucial context and demonstrates the importance of recording police interactions from different vantage points. The sheriff's office has launched an internal investigation following the video's viral spread, while McNeil's lawyers state the incident was racially motivated and unlawful.</p>

Featuring his first major television interview in a decade, Berkowitz speaks about his life before the murders and his experiences in prison, where he is serving six life sentences. Now in his 60s, he describes his past actions as walking in darkness and serving a demonic entity, expressing remorse for the pain he caused.

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal watchdog agency, has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith. The probe follows a request from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith may have violated the Hatch Act, a law barring government employees from engaging in political activities. Cotton's complaint argues that Smith's investigations into former President Donald Trump were intended to negatively influence the 2024 election. The OSC investigation is not a criminal one, and both Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland have previously maintained their actions were not politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a swarm of drones. The system is designed to create a protective "storm eye," or a null zone, around friendly forces, canceling out jamming signals in a targeted area. This allows the drones to simultaneously jam enemy communications while ensuring allied communications remain unaffected. According to a recently published paper, this method marks a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming, which often disrupts all signals within range, including those of friendly units. The technology could provide a major tactical advantage in electronic combat scenarios.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving military procurement. The officials are accused of signing state contracts for drones and electronic warfare systems at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed his "zero tolerance" policy for corruption and praised the agencies for their work. The arrests come shortly after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored following a public backlash against a bill that would have curtailed their power, a move seen as critical for Ukraine's EU membership aspirations.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a small, idealistic project into a foundational layer of the modern financial system, with a market capitalization of over $400 billion. The article traces its journey from a bare-bones network to the backbone for decentralized finance, NFTs, and the tokenization of real-world assets by major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's staggering growth, while also cautioning against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption accelerates. Experts note that Ethereum's stability and programmability are making it the preferred "plumbing" for the future of Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>President Trump Fires Head of Bureau of Labor Statistics After Disappointing Jobs Report</h2>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the release of a July jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected hiring. The report indicated only 73,000 jobs were added, and it included a significant downward revision of 258,000 jobs for the previous two months. Trump claimed the numbers were inaccurate and politically manipulated, ordering the immediate dismissal of the "Biden Political Appointee." The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who warn that it undermines the integrity of crucial, nonpartisan economic data and sets a dangerous precedent for politicizing federal statistical agencies.
