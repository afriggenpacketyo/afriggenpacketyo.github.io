          <p>Based on recent government inflation data, policy experts project that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This increase, which is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment from 2025, aims to align benefits with rising consumer prices. The official COLA is determined by averaging inflation data from July, August, and September, with the final announcement expected from the Social Security Administration in October. The article notes that potential impacts from tariffs on future inflation data could still influence the final figure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to address what he calls "crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor" in Washington, D.C. by federalizing the city's police force and deploying the National Guard. His agenda includes clearing homeless encampments, revoking the cash-bail system, and ending sanctuary-city policies. However, his authority is constrained by the 1973 Home Rule Act, which limits such a federal takeover of the police to a maximum of 30 days without congressional approval. Critics, including the city's attorney general, have called the move unlawful, citing data that shows crime rates are at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15th to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The summit was announced after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face increased sanctions. The meeting's location in Alaska, which the U.S. purchased from Russia in 1867, holds historical significance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend but will be briefed afterward, as Trump aims to broker a peace deal that may involve territorial concessions.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% support among registered voters, compared to 25% for Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, also running as an independent, trails with just 7% support. Mamdani's strength is particularly notable among younger voters, though he faces a challenge in gaining traction with Black and Jewish voters, where Cuomo currently leads.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly threatened to sue Apple, alleging antitrust violations over the exclusion of his companies, X and Grok, from the App Store's "Must Have" recommendations. Musk questioned whether Apple was "playing politics," asserting that X is the top news app and Grok is a top-five app overall. He claimed that Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company other than OpenAI to achieve a top ranking. This move follows other antitrust challenges Apple has faced, including a significant fine from European Union regulators for similar anti-competitive behavior.</p>

The meeting is notable as Vance is not expected to formally meet with the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, due to scheduling difficulties. Jenrick, who was defeated by Badenoch in a past leadership contest, is seen as a potential future leader, and his alignment with Vance on issues like free speech and anti-EDI initiatives has drawn attention. The visit underscores growing connections between American and British conservative movements.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the interest-earning potential of a $50,000 deposit in either a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account in the current economic climate. It breaks down calculations for various timeframes, showing that for shorter terms like three months, a high-yield savings account might earn slightly more due to higher variable rates. However, for longer terms such as six or twelve months, a CD with a fixed rate can provide a higher, guaranteed return. The choice depends on a saver's risk tolerance and timeline, especially with potential future interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England is currently experiencing its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures reaching 33.4C in London and other regions meeting the official heatwave criteria. The sustained high temperatures and dry conditions have led to "nationally significant" water shortages, prompting warnings from the national drought group about environmental damage, increased wildfire risk, and impacts on farming. In response, millions are now under hosepipe bans, and rail services are facing disruptions due to the heat's effect on tracks. Amber and yellow heat health alerts are in effect across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% in July compared to the previous year, an unchanged rate that was aided by falling gasoline and grocery prices. However, the "core" CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, climbed at its fastest annual rate since February, suggesting underlying inflationary pressures. Economists suggest that the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are beginning to contribute to rising prices for certain goods, such as household furnishings.

Despite this, Arredondo waited 77 minutes before confronting the gunman, a decision directly contrary to his training.

          <p>This article examines whether reverse mortgages are a safe financial option for seniors looking to supplement their retirement income by tapping into home equity. While most reverse mortgages are federally regulated and insured, providing some protections, they are not without risks. Homeowners must continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance to avoid default and potential foreclosure. The loan balance grows over time, which can significantly deplete the home's equity, impacting inheritance or funds for future housing.

          <h2>Texas Attorney General Seeks Jail Time for Beto O'Rourke Amid Redistricting Fundraising Dispute</h2>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking a judge to consider jailing former congressman Beto O'Rourke for allegedly violating a court order. The order temporarily blocked O'Rourke and his political group, Powered by People, from fundraising to support Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a Republican-led redistricting effort. Paxton's filing claims O'Rourke openly defied the order by continuing to solicit donations online and at a rally. This legal escalation is part of a high-stakes political battle over a new congressional map that could significantly favor Republicans in upcoming elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party came to power in the UK last summer. This milestone highlights the ongoing challenge the government faces in fulfilling its key election pledge to "smash" people-smuggling gangs and reduce crossing numbers. The figure for the period is over 13,000 higher than during the same timeframe a year earlier under the previous Conservative government. The news comes as French authorities confirmed another death during a crossing attempt, underscoring the persistent dangers of the journey.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to "democratize" retirement savings by giving workers access to asset classes that have the potential for high returns but also carry higher risks and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While the private equity industry has long sought access to the vast retirement market, it is unclear how quickly employers would adopt these new, more complex options for their workers.

          <p>President Trump has intensified his public pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, demanding an immediate interest rate cut and threatening to allow a "major lawsuit" to proceed against him. In a social media post, Trump claimed the potential lawsuit would relate to alleged mismanagement and cost overruns on renovations at the Fed's headquarters. This represents a significant escalation of the president's long-standing criticism of Powell's monetary policy, which he claims has been "too late" in cutting rates. The Fed has so far held rates steady in 2025, defying the president's demands.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has made a surprising, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. This move comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested that Google should be forced to divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine and its own recently launched browser, stated that it has secured backing from several investors for the deal. The bid represents a bold strategic maneuver by the startup to acquire a critical internet gateway and challenge Google's dominance.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has reportedly warned its domestic companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 and certain AMD artificial intelligence chips, particularly for government and national security purposes. This directive follows a new U.S. policy that grants export licenses for these less-advanced chips in exchange for a 15% tax on the revenue from their sales to China. The move by Beijing signals a push for technological self-reliance and a rejection of the U.S. government's attempt to both restrict and profit from AI chip exports. This development further complicates the technological and trade relationship between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Residents and activists in the Cotswolds region of England held a protest rally dubbed "Dance Against Vance" to voice their opposition to the policies of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who is on a private holiday in the area. Approximately 100 people gathered in the village of Charlbury with placards criticizing his stances on issues like the war in Ukraine and climate change. Organizers from the Stop Trump Coalition said the vice president was "not welcome" in their community. The protest highlights the international reach of U.S. political divisions and local opposition to the presence of controversial political figures.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder in a UK court after being hired as an assassin in 2019. Betro flew to Birmingham, England, as part of a plot born from a feud between two other men and a local businessman. Disguised in a niqab, she attempted to shoot the businessman's son at point-blank range, but her gun jammed, and the target escaped unharmed. After nearly five years on the run, she was brought to trial and convicted, though her motive for becoming involved in the plot remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Investigators have revealed that the man who fired hundreds of rounds at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta was motivated by anger over COVID-19 vaccines. The gunman, Patrick Joseph White, reportedly blamed the vaccine for causing him depression and suicidal thoughts before the attack. The shooting resulted in the death of police officer David Rose, who responded to the scene. White died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident highlights the dangerous real-world consequences of vaccine-related disinformation and anti-government sentiment.</p>
