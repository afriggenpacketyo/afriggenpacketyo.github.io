          <p>Edan Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, was released by Hamas after being held hostage in Gaza for more than 19 months, with the transfer facilitated by the Red Cross to the Israel Defense Forces. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed the government's commitment to securing the release of all hostages, while President Trump celebrated Alexander's freedom. Hamas stated the release was intended to foster a lasting ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza, noting discussions with the U.S. administration. Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when abducted, is now 21 years old, and his release occurred amid ongoing conflict and dire food security concerns in Gaza.</p>

On the Democratic side, Iowa state auditor Rob Sand has also entered the race, marking the first major moves from both parties. The Iowa race is expected to be closely watched both within the state and nationally, serving as a training ground for political operatives and potential presidential candidates.</p>

          <p>Despite recent trade deals with China and the United Kingdom, the tariff rate imposed by the U.S. on imports remains higher than at any point since the 1930s, according to a Yale Budget Lab report. The total U.S. average effective tariff rate stands at 17.8%, a substantial increase from pre-Trump's second term, costing the average household an estimated $2,800 in the short term. The report notes that the reduction in tariff rates is primarily due to lower rates on Chinese imports, with the U.S.-U.K. trade deal having minimal impact on average tariff rates. Economists anticipate that businesses and consumers will adjust their purchasing behavior to mitigate the higher costs associated with tariffs.</p>

          <p>Following a US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged a strong response to any future "terrorist attack" against India. Modi emphasized that while it is not an era of war, it is also not an era of terror, and stated that water issues with India would be resolved through peaceful negotiations. His comments followed days of intense military exchanges between India and Pakistan, triggered by a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by revenue from President Trump's trade policies, according to the Treasury Department. This surge in customs duties significantly exceeded collections from both the previous month and the same period last year, contributing to a surplus for the month. While the U.S. continues to face a substantial budget deficit, the increase in tariff revenue helped to reduce the imbalance in April. High interest rates, however, continue to pose a budgetary challenge, with net interest on the national debt remaining a significant expense.</p>

          <p>President Trump's mass-deportation campaign, a key promise of his second term, is facing increasing public scrutiny and eroding support. While Trump initially enjoyed strong approval on immigration issues, particularly regarding border control, his approval rating has declined due to concerns over aggressive ICE enforcement within U.S. communities. Polls indicate limited support for deporting immigrants without criminal records, especially those with ties to U.S. citizens or who came to the U.S. as children. This shift in public sentiment coincides with increased funding for ICE detention facilities, potentially leading to a clash between policy and public opinion.</p>

          <p>Six Bulgarians have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms for spying for Russia in the UK and across Europe, with sentences ranging from six to over ten years. The spy ring, which targeted investigative journalists and Russian dissidents, was described as one of the largest foreign intelligence operations in the UK. The group, motivated by money, conducted surveillance and planned potential kidnappings and killings under the direction of Jan Marsalek, who is believed to be hiding in Moscow. The case highlights the increasing threat of state espionage and the use of outsourced operations.</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, President Trump's former personal criminal attorney, has been appointed acting Librarian of Congress. The appointment, along with two other Justice Department officials taking on Library of Congress roles, has raised concerns given the library's status as an agency of the legislative branch. The move follows the firing of Carla Hayden, the previous librarian of Congress, and has prompted calls for congressional oversight and a review of the appointment process. The library serves as Congress's primary main research arm, and the nation's copyright office.</p>

          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom is urging California cities to clear homeless encampments, escalating his efforts to address the issue. Newsom's administration has drafted a local law that counties, cities and towns can directly adopt or modify to achieve the Democratic governor's goals. He's also releasing $3.3 billion in voter-approved funds to expand housing and treatment options for homeless residents. The key provisions of the model ordinance announced Monday include prohibitions on “persistent camping” in one location, a ban on encampments that block sidewalks and a requirement that local officials provide notice and make every reasonable effort to identify and offer shelter prior to clearing an encampment.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, but the order cites no obvious legal authority to mandate lower prices. The order said the administration would consider taking regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries in the future if drugmakers do not comply. The executive order also called on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices and to push them to pay more. With his executive order, Mr. Trump opted not to propose measures that could have had more teeth, such as calling for his administration to work with Congress on legislation or writing regulations to change how government health programs pay for some drugs.</p>

The House Ways and Means Committee released the full text of its portion of the bill, which would increase the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. However, the SALT deduction limit has been a contentious issue in tax bill negotiations and remains subject to change. The current $10,000 SALT deduction limit, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 without congressional action.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced stricter British immigration rules, aiming to end what he described as a "failed experiment in open borders." The new rules, which require parliamentary approval, make it harder to obtain work, family, and student visas. Immigrants will need to pass higher-level English proficiency tests and spend at least 10 years in the country before applying for citizenship. Employers will face restrictions on recruiting overseas workers, particularly for low-skilled jobs. Critics have condemned Starmer's language as inflaming anti-immigrant sentiment, while others argue the proposals don't go far enough.</p>
