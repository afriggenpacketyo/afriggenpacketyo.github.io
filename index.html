          <p>Iraq's parliament is debating a controversial new law to regulate the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a powerful paramilitary group with ties to Iran. Critics, including the US State Department, warn this could legitimize "armed terrorist groups" and further entrench Iranian influence, potentially triggering US sanctions. Conversely, supporters argue the law aims to assimilate these groups into state institutions, thereby allowing Iraq to assert greater independence from Iran. The proposed amendments seek to clarify the PMF's command hierarchy, budgetary oversight, and integration into the national security framework, addressing ambiguities in the existing 2016 law. Prime Minister al-Sudani supports reforms to make the PMF less political and more transparent.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Consolidating Credit Card Debt While Protecting Your Credit Score</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 13:53:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card debt nearing $8,000 and interest rates around 22%, many Americans seek debt consolidation. This article outlines methods to combine multiple balances without negatively impacting credit scores. Options include debt management programs through credit counseling, which can lower interest rates and simplify payments, and personal loans, which offer fixed rates and improve credit mix by reducing utilization. Other strategies involve balance transfers to 0% APR cards or leveraging home equity loans/HELOCs for lower rates. While applying for new credit can cause a temporary dip, these approaches, when managed responsibly, can lead to improved financial health and a stronger credit profile. (not investment advice)</p>

The couple, who began dating in 2023 after Kelce's public attempt to meet Swift at her Eras Tour, posted a joint Instagram message humorously stating, "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married." Swift recently appeared on Kelce's "New Heights" podcast, crediting it for their relationship and playfully calling Kelce "the good kind of crazy."

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of their parents' 1989 murders, are seeking to overturn their convictions based on new evidence supporting their long-standing claims of physical and sexual abuse. A newly discovered letter from Erik to his cousin, written months before the killings, details ongoing abuse by their father. Additionally, former Menudo band member Roy Rossello has come forward with an affidavit alleging sexual assault by Jose Menendez. These developments are central to a habeas petition arguing the brothers should have been convicted of manslaughter due to imperfect self-defense, potentially leading to a new trial or resentencing.</p>

          <p>Germany's auto industry has cut approximately 51,500 jobs within a year, nearly 7% of its workforce, making it the most affected sector in the ongoing economic downturn. Overall industrial employment fell by 114,000 jobs, or 2.1%, with total industrial revenue declining for the eighth consecutive quarter. Factors contributing to these losses include falling sales, intense competition from China, and the costly transition to electric vehicles. Experts warn this trend will continue, impacting young engineers and potentially increasing graduate unemployment, a rare occurrence in Germany. Major firms like Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have initiated cost-cutting programs.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has defended border pushbacks as a "highly effective measure," reporting that over 10,000 migrants, including 550 asylum seekers, have been turned away since May 8. He stated that more than 30,000 people have been stopped since border checks were introduced in September 2024, leading to a halving of illegal migrants and Germany dropping to third place among EU destinations. Responding to court rulings labeling forced returns unlawful, Dobrindt asserted that politics must remain adaptable, insisting his actions adhere to European and German legal frameworks, aiming to prevent radical parties from gaining traction.</p>

Speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Berlin, Merz asserted that the conditions for state recognition are currently not fulfilled. Germany maintains that recognition should be a final step within a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians coexist peacefully. This stance contrasts with Canada's plan to recognize Palestine at the UN General Assembly in September and France's similar pledge, despite a recent poll showing over half of Germans support recognizing a Palestinian state.</p>

The incident, which began Monday afternoon in the Veddel district, resulted in six injuries, including three firefighters, with one victim in critical condition.

          <p>The law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP is seeking an additional $5 million, raising its contract to $5.9 million, for its work defending the city of Los Angeles in a lawsuit concerning its homeless programs. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto argues the firm prevented the city from losing control over its initiatives and protected officials from testifying. However, critics, including Councilmember Monica Rodriguez and L.A. Alliance attorney Matthew Umhofer, deem the request "ludicrous," suggesting the funds would be better spent on housing solutions rather than prolonged legal battles. The firm previously billed $1.8 million for two weeks of work.</p>

          <p>Whirlpool, a major American appliance manufacturer, expects President Trump's proposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to give it a competitive edge against foreign rivals like LG and Samsung. With 80% of its products made in the U.S. and 96% of its metal sourced domestically, Whirlpool's senior vice president, Jason Ebert, believes tariffs will level the playing field by increasing the costs for importers. While the company's U.S. factories are not currently at full capacity due to declining volumes, Ebert hopes increased demand for domestic-made appliances will lead to ramped-up production and hiring, supported by AI for efficiency.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, paving the way for global approval filings. The pill, a potential needle-free alternative to current GLP-1 injections, helped patients lose an average of 10.5% of their weight over 72 weeks and significantly lowered A1c levels. While existing injections show greater weight loss, orforglipron offers convenience and lacks dietary restrictions, with a high percentage of patients achieving clinical remission for Type 2 diabetes. Despite gastrointestinal side effects, its potential to expand access to obesity treatments is highly anticipated, especially if priced lower than injections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has ignited a constitutional and economic debate, with Cook threatening legal action. This dispute highlights the critical importance of the Fed's independence, which aims to keep prices stable and maximize employment without political interference. Economists and investors are concerned that political influence over monetary policy, such as forcing interest rate cuts, could lead to inflation, market instability, and increased borrowing costs for the US government, potentially causing global ripple effects. The situation revives historical tensions between presidents and the Fed, underscoring the risks of compromising the central bank's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Lisa Cook, the first Black woman on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, is facing an attempted removal by Donald Trump, a challenge in her career marked by overcoming obstacles. Nominated by President Biden in 2022 after a contentious confirmation, Cook's appointment was a historic milestone. Trump's action stems from unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, but Cook asserts her removal lacks legal "cause" and her attorney plans to sue. Her academic work often connected economics with race and discrimination, notably showing how racial violence impacted Black inventors. Cook has openly discussed the hostility faced by women, especially Black women, in the economics profession.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's summer crime campaign, culminating in its illegal immigration strategy, has significantly captured public attention, arguably outperforming both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. The party's rising influence, fueled by consistent leads in opinion polls, reflects growing voter concerns over illegal immigration, particularly small boat crossings. While other parties, including Labour and the Conservatives, have also focused on addressing migration issues, Reform UK is proposing the most radical solutions, including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. Nigel Farage's campaign highlights a shift in the political discourse towards more stringent immigration measures.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that large methane leaks from California oil and gas facilities are also releasing a dangerous mix of toxic chemicals, including cancer-causing benzene, jeopardizing nearby communities. An interactive map by PSE Healthy Energy identifies over 1,300 such "super-emitter" events nationwide, with 32 in California's San Joaquin Valley, where 24,100 residents live within two miles of these leaks. In almost all cases, benzene levels exceeded California's health risk benchmarks, yet the odorless gas is often undetectable without specialized equipment.

The article highlights the historical and economic reasons for the Fed's independence, crucial for stable monetary policy free from political manipulation, citing past economic turmoil caused by presidential interference.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is facing criticism for its upcoming policy, effective January 27, requiring plus-sized passengers who don't fit between armrests to purchase an extra seat in advance. Unlike the current policy, a refund for the second seat will no longer be guaranteed and depends on flight capacity and booking class. If an extra seat isn't bought beforehand and the flight is full, the passenger will be rebooked. This change, alongside the recent end of free checked bags and introduction of assigned seating, is seen by critics as eroding Southwest's unique customer-friendly identity and potentially worsening the flying experience for all travelers.</p>
