          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 05:34:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under a new plan from regulator Ofgem, all UK energy suppliers must offer a tariff with a lower daily standing charge, but this will be offset by higher rates for each unit of energy used. The change addresses complaints from low-energy users about fixed daily fees they cannot control, but consumer advocates and charities warn it is unlikely to reduce overall energy bills. This policy adjustment comes as millions of households face a 2% rise in their energy bills starting in October, with the regulator admitting it can only shift costs around, not eliminate them.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Climate scientists are warning that super typhoons like Ragasa are becoming more common and stronger due to climate change. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for storms, enabling them to intensify from a storm to a super typhoon more rapidly. This increased energy also causes typhoons to stall over coastlines, where they can deliver colossal amounts of rain, rather than moving inland and dissipating. The article notes that average temperatures in the Pacific Ocean have risen by approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius over the last century, directly contributing to this trend.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva won a special election in Arizona's seventh district, securing the House seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Congressman Raúl Grijalva. Her victory over Republican Daniel Butierez narrows the Republican majority in the House and makes her the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress. Grijalva, a longtime local official, ran on a progressive platform and successfully navigated a primary where her experience was contrasted with her opponent's youth and criticism of her family's political legacy.</p>

The company experienced sales declines in established stores across all major regions, with North America and the UK being the worst hit. In response to the challenging market, which has seen its share price fall over 40% in the past year, JD Sports is focusing on controlling costs and optimizing its existing store footprint.

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, President Donald Trump made a significant policy pivot, stating that Ukraine is positioned to "win all of Ukraine back in its original form." In a social media post, Trump cited Russia's economic troubles as a key factor, a stark reversal from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede territory to achieve peace. Zelenskyy praised the change in tone, calling Trump a "game changer" and expressing gratitude for his determination to help end the war.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the most powerful storms of the year, has caused extensive damage across Hong Kong and southern China with hurricane-force winds and severe storm surges. Before reaching the mainland, the storm brought torrential rains to Taiwan that breached a dam, resulting in a flood that killed 14 people. In response to the storm's approach, authorities in southern China evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from low-lying areas as the typhoon, dubbed the "King of Storms," made landfall with record-breaking wind gusts.</p>

          <p>An opinion article questions the substance behind Secretary of State Marco Rubio's praise of Mexico's cooperation in combating crime, suggesting it may be a tactical move by both nations. The author argues that while Mexico's government under President Sheinbaum has taken some visible steps, such as extraditing cartel leaders, it has not addressed the strategic problem of deep-rooted collusion between the state and criminal organizations. The article contends that without verifiable action against this narco-state apparatus, any current cooperation is temporary and the underlying security crisis remains unsolved.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup approaches, Team Europe is preparing for the challenge of winning on American soil for the first time in over a decade at Bethpage. The article explores the strategic difficulties, particularly the famously raucous home crowd, which captain Luke Donald has called a "bear pit." With a veteran team that is largely unchanged from their victorious 2023 campaign, Europe is focused on mental resilience and a strong start to quiet the partisan fans and break the recent trend of home-side dominance in the competition.</p>

          <p>During a debate on Germany's 2026 federal budget, Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Bundestag that the nation is facing one of the most challenging periods in its modern history. He called for deep reforms to address an economic slowdown and global instability, warning that Germany's export-driven economy is vulnerable to disruptions in the rules-based world order. The debate also saw the far-right AfD party accuse the government of a "debt binge" over its planned borrowing, highlighting the contentious political climate surrounding the country's fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million lost to fraud over the past year, thanks to a new artificial intelligence tool. More than a third of this sum, £186 million, was related to fraudulent activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, including blocking companies with suspicious Bounce Back Loans from dissolving. The AI tool, which scans new policies for potential weaknesses, will now be licensed to international partners including the United States, Canada, and Australia to help them combat fraud.</p>
