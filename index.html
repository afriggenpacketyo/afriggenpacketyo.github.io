          <p>In Bristol, street sex workers are collaborating with the police and a charity to safeguard at-risk children, offering crucial insights into child exploitation through the Night Light initiative. These women, often the eyes and ears of the night, provide vital information that aids in prosecuting child sex offenders and identifying vulnerable underage girls, with one sex worker even playing a key role in bringing a man who was abusing his daughter to justice. The Night Light team, which started in 2020, conducts regular patrols to engage with sex workers and young individuals, fostering trust and providing support, food, and clothing. Many of the sex workers, having experienced sexual assault themselves, are passionate about preventing similar situations for young people, expressing a desire for such a program to have existed during their own childhoods.</p>

Trump, while acknowledging a past good relationship with Newsom, also criticized California's high-speed rail project and the handling of wildfires.

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist, argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, dubbed the "Mar-a-Lago Accord," is based on a flawed understanding of trade imbalances. Rogoff contends that while the dollar's reserve currency status plays a role, it is only one of many factors contributing to America's persistent trade deficits. He suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more effective solution than launching a trade war. The article also highlights the strength of the American economy as a key factor behind the current account deficit, making US businesses attractive to investors.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing conflict and Russian occupation, Ukraine's economy has demonstrated impressive resilience, underpinned by effective military resistance and economic management. However, this resilience is built on a dependence on foreign financial assistance, as Ukraine lacks the domestic resources to meet the war's enormous costs. While Russia's economy has defied expectations, it is fundamentally dependent on fossil fuels, making it vulnerable to long-term supply and demand trends in global oil markets. The recent minerals agreement with the United States, while seen as a victory for Ukraine, serves as a stark reminder of the country's dependence on its allies and the potential for unequal terms in international agreements.</p>

The bill follows calls for change from the families of murdered individuals whose killers did not attend their sentencing hearings.
