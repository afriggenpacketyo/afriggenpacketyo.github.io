          <p>Ukraine's air force reported the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, during a massive overnight Russian attack involving over 500 drones and missiles. Ustimenko was credited with downing seven targets before his plane was damaged, and he guided it away from residential areas before crashing. While Ukrainian air defenses, aided by F-16s, intercepted a majority of the projectiles, Russian strikes were confirmed in several locations. The incident highlights the intense and dangerous nature of the air war as Ukraine continues to defend against one of the largest barrages to date.</p>

          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey, Michael Testa, has introduced legislation to rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal appears inspired by former President Trump's order to rename a portion of the Gulf of Mexico, with Testa arguing that New Jersey's significant commercial and recreational fishing industries justify the name change. The move is part of a broader trend of symbolic political gestures, as the bill would require state agencies to update all materials to reflect the new name if passed.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for a ceasefire deal in Gaza to secure the return of hostages, while also denouncing the ongoing corruption trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a "POLITICAL WITCH HUNT." He suggested the trial distracts Netanyahu from negotiations and is similar to legal challenges he has faced. This intervention in Israeli domestic affairs comes as an Israeli official indicated Netanyahu may travel to Washington for talks, signaling potential movement on a new deal to halt the 20-month-long conflict. Meanwhile, the Israeli military has ordered new mass evacuations in northern Gaza.</p>

          <p>Analysts and historians are discussing how to label the recent conflict between Iran and Israel, with former President Trump suggesting the name "12-Day War." Experts note that official names for wars are often determined by journalists and historians over time, not by government officials, pointing to examples like the "Gulf War" versus "Operation Desert Storm." The article also explores the broader anxiety about a potential "World War III," with most experts cautioning that current global conflicts, while serious, do not meet the scale or interconnectedness of past world wars, partly due to the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Couples planning weddings are facing unexpected costs as new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods impact the bridal industry, where an estimated 90% of gowns are made in China. President Trump's trade policies have led to surcharges and price hikes of up to 30% on dresses, veils, and accessories, creating uncertainty for both brides and boutique owners. Store owners struggle to budget for fluctuating tariff costs on special-order gowns that take months to arrive. The tariffs have not spurred U.S. manufacturing, as the skilled labor for intricate beadwork largely no longer exists domestically at a competitive price point.</p>

The system, created without a public process, integrates Social Security and immigration data to allow election officials to verify voter citizenship status. While proponents argue it could streamline verification and prevent noncitizen voting, privacy advocates and legal experts express alarm over the rapid creation of a de facto national citizen roster.

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium in "a matter of months," despite recent US and Israeli attacks on its nuclear facilities. Contradicting claims by former President Trump that the sites were "totally obliterated," Grossi clarified that the damage was severe but not total, and Iran retains the necessary industrial and technological capacity. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is particularly concerned about 400 kilograms of uranium already enriched to 60%, whose whereabouts are unknown. This development complicates diplomatic efforts, especially as Iran has suspended cooperation with the IAEA.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf in Pakistan has intensified concerns about the safety of women with a public online presence. Many Pakistani women who use social media for self-expression or professional purposes report facing a barrage of online harassment, stalking, and threats that can escalate into real-world violence. Patriarchal norms often lead to judgment and victim-blaming, framing women's online visibility as a threat to cultural or religious values. While some platform features have helped, many women feel that social media companies and authorities provide inadequate protection from these dangers.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported that at least 81 Palestinians were killed and over 400 were injured in Israeli strikes over a 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people in tents, killing at least 11 individuals, including children. Further strikes in the al-Mawasi and Tuffah areas also resulted in civilian casualties. These events occur as mediators intensify efforts for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, though negotiations with Israel reportedly remain stalled.</p>

          <p>France is leading a â‚¬1.35 billion investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a potential European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. However, industry experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale in the near future, as its OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites is dwarfed by Starlink's 7,600. Analysts note that Eutelsat will need significant further investment to expand its network and upgrade its technology. While it may struggle in the mass-market consumer segment, the company is well-positioned to serve European government and enterprise clients who prioritize sovereign control over raw capacity.</p>

With the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito already holding a minority in the lower house, losing their upper house majority could threaten Ishiba's premiership and destabilize the ruling coalition.</p>
