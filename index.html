          <p>Authorities in Idaho have released details about a deadly ambush on firefighters, identifying 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect who is believed to have died by suicide. Roley allegedly set a brush fire to lure first responders into a trap, resulting in the deaths of firefighters Frank Harwood and John Morrison, and injuring Dave Tisdale. An image from the suspect's social media shows him in camouflage and face paint before the attack. The motive remains unclear, though it's reported Roley once had aspirations to be a firefighter, and the incident is being investigated as a deliberate assault on emergency personnel.</p>

Devine had spoken to his mother that evening, reassuring her he was safe despite her pleas for him to evacuate. He is the only known victim of the fire to have perished east of Lake Avenue.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the criminology Ph.D. student accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has reportedly been offered a plea deal. The deal would allow him to avoid the death penalty. The family of victim Kaylee Goncalves expressed outrage over the proposal, stating they felt failed by the Latah County Prosecutor's Office and were not adequately consulted. Kohberger was linked to the crime scene by DNA evidence found on a knife sheath and was set to stand trial in August after numerous delays.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is grappling with a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to disability benefits, particularly the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces opposition from dozens of his own MPs who are concerned the reforms will harm vulnerable individuals. The government argues the changes are necessary for the long-term stability of the welfare state, but critics within the party feel the approach is wrong-headed. The ongoing dispute highlights a major test of party unity and the government's ability to manage its legislative agenda on sensitive social issues.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina detention officer, 56-year-old Francisco Flattes, was shot and killed after an inmate seized his weapon during a medical visit. The inmate, 48-year-old Kelvin Simmons, was being escorted for orthopedic treatment when a scuffle broke out. After the shooting, Simmons allegedly carjacked a vehicle and fled but was later apprehended. A second officer was injured but is expected to recover. Simmons, a federal inmate facing bank robbery charges, will now be charged with first-degree murder, marking what the local sheriff called one of the worst days of his career.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound, betaine, which may explain how long-term exercise slows the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine is produced in the kidneys during exercise and acts as a messenger to prevent inflammation and organ aging. It functions by inhibiting a specific enzyme, TBK1. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of physical activity and could potentially lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, according to the research team.</p>

The magazine issued a statement clarifying the cartoon was not of the prophet but was a fictionalized depiction meant to highlight the plight of Muslims, apologizing for any offense. Despite this, Turkish officials, including the Interior Minister, condemned the work as a "vile attack" not protected by free speech, and launched a criminal investigation.</p>

Now, groups like Springfield Community Gardens are struggling to supply food to schools and senior centers, and farmers who expanded operations to meet the demand are facing significant financial losses.

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has requested that the Trump administration return 200 troops to California state command. This move comes as the state enters fire season with its specialized National Guard firefighting unit at just 40% strength, due to troops being diverted for protest-related duties. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the Guard, supports the request, emphasizing the critical need for these troops to combat wildfires. The decision highlights tension between the federal deployment for immigration-related unrest and the state's urgent needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing the stock market by favoring innovative, story-driven companies over established giants. He argues these investors are drawn to bold ideas, such as Robinhood's use of blockchain for private company trading, and are less concerned with traditional metrics or Federal Reserve policies. Cramer suggests this has created an "idea market" where companies like Reddit and DoorDash are rewarded for their growth potential rather than immediate earnings. This contrasts with institutional strategies focused on indices, indicating a shift in market enthusiasm. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical obstacles are a primary reason for falling childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Rather than vaccine hesitancy, parents face difficulties booking appointments, getting time off work, and accessing clear information, which prevents them from getting their children immunized. This decline has led to recent outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles. The report recommends improving booking systems through NHS apps, expanding vaccination services, and finalizing a digital record book to help parents track their child's immunization status and improve public health outcomes.</p>

          <p>As US health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has launched an ambitious mission to tackle chronic disease, a goal many experts support. However, his approach is deeply controversial, blending mainstream concerns about processed foods with a history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies and dismantling parts of the public health system. While he has targeted food additives and gained support from some for challenging the food industry, critics worry he ignores systemic issues like poverty and undermines science, particularly regarding vaccines. This article examines whether his divisive, high-profile strategy can genuinely improve American health or will cause significant harm.</p>

Government lawyers contend the president has the authority to make this determination and that the courts cannot second-guess it.
