          <p>The NHS has announced plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in A&E departments. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients, as well as those referred by GPs and police, providing immediate care in a calm environment. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey praised this as a pioneering model, ensuring individuals receive the right support promptly, while reducing strain on emergency services. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for thorough testing and better funding for NHS mental health services, given the recent decline in mental health spending. </p>

The overnight barrage caused fires and explosions across Kyiv, damaging homes, businesses, and cars, while prisoner swaps continue between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides agreeing to exchange a total of 1,000 prisoners each. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to David Marcus, a provision in the GOP's "big beautiful bill" to eliminate taxes on overtime pay could significantly benefit working Americans and help Republicans in the midterm elections. Marcus argues that this policy resonates deeply with workers and employers, potentially encouraging younger workers to take on overtime shifts and boosting production. He emphasizes that this measure would provide a tangible financial benefit, allowing workers to save for vacations or invest in their families, and suggests that Republicans should highlight their support for this policy in their campaigns. </p>

However, most applications are from individuals eligible through family links, and the UK government is considering provisions for quicker qualification based on contributions made, alongside stricter language requirements. </p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the United States could offset China's numerical advantage in military fleet size by deploying next-generation fighter jets and "loyal wingmen" drones. General David Allvin, chief of staff of the US Air Force, recently showcased the YFQ-42A unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), emphasizing its cost-effectiveness and lethality. These UCAVs are part of the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program, aimed at augmenting crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions, though analysts acknowledge that China is rapidly catching up in this area of military technology. </p>

          <p>The United States and Israel are experiencing widening divisions as the Trump administration pursues policies that undermine Prime Minister Netanyahu's agenda. Trump's recent Middle East trip omitted Israel, signaling a shift in priorities, and disagreements have emerged over Iran, Gaza, Syria, and Yemen. While America's support for Israel remains generally strong, Trump's willingness to disregard Israeli interests and reduce US involvement in the region presents new challenges for the alliance. </p>

          <p>Labour MPs are increasingly challenging Chancellor Rachel Reeves's fiscal policies, proposing alternatives to welfare cuts and advocating for increased investment in public services. As Labour's poll ratings decline, MPs from across the political spectrum are urging Reeves to consider measures such as a wealth tax, a relaxation of fiscal rules, and reforms to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility. These proposals aim to address the economic challenges while avoiding deeper cuts to unprotected departments and supporting economic growth. </p>
