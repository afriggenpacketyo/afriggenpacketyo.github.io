          <p>The article discusses the suspicious death of Kendy Howard, who was found in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head, initially reported as a suicide by her husband, Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper. Investigators grew suspicious due to several unusual details, including broken glass, wet towels, and warm bathwater. One of the most intriguing clues was an unfinished dryer cycle with only six minutes remaining, started just before Dan Howard called 911. Investigators theorized that Dan Howard could have murdered his wife, leading to his arrest and trial.</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was arrested for the murder of his wife, Kendy Howard, two years after she was found dead in her bathtub with a gunshot wound. Initially dispatched as a suicide, investigators found several clues at the scene that raised suspicions, including a packed duffle bag, warm bathwater, and a running dryer. Kendy had told a friend she wanted a divorce, and her daughter accused Dan of the murder. The prosecution argued that Dan had killed Kendy using a carotid restraint hold, a technique he learned during his law enforcement training.</p>

          <p>Japan and China have traded accusations regarding airspace violations near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. Japan claimed that a Chinese helicopter entered its airspace, prompting a strong protest from the Foreign Ministry and the scrambling of fighter jets. Conversely, China alleged that a Japanese civilian aircraft illegally entered the airspace of the islands and was subsequently expelled by a Chinese helicopter. These events have further strained the already tense bilateral relations between Tokyo and Beijing, which are often marred by territorial disputes in the region.</p>

Unlike potential candidates who might have tempered Trump's impulses, Vance was an accelerationist who would not challenge the president. This choice demonstrated a move away from the coalition government of Trump's first term to a court of loyalists, where dissent is discouraged and Trump's most extreme ideas are less likely to be checked.</p>
