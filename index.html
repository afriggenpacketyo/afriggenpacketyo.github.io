          <p>The Labour Party is trying to move past a misstep concerning the Winter Fuel Payment. The party initially planned to limit the payment to pensioners receiving pension credit, but faced criticism for this decision. The government has since revised the policy, with details on eligibility and repayment now available. This situation has been a significant challenge for the Labour Party, raising questions about their fiscal planning and the handling of the policy change. The hope is that this resolution will allow the party to focus on other priorities and rebuild public trust. The author's sentiment is stable and the situation is resolving.</p>

Figueiredo had a history of suicide attempts, and the hospital had been warned about the risks of keeping bin bags in communal areas, which she used in her final attempt.
