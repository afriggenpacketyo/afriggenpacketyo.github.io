          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Chicago street gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 while already serving a 200-year sentence for a 1973 murder. His attorneys expressed their gratitude for Trump's action, citing Hoover's rehabilitation efforts and decades in solitary confinement. While some, like former prosecutor Ron Safer, voiced disappointment, others, including former gang members, supported Hoover's release, emphasizing the possibility of rehabilitation and second chances.

          <p>Analysts predict that trade tensions and global supply chain issues will significantly slow the growth of China's aviation capacity. Remaining tariffs on imports from the U.S. could add millions of dollars to the cost of Boeing jets, making Chinese airlines reluctant to import them. Delivery delays and potential order cancellations are also expected to impact the industry. Despite recent tariff cuts, China's civil aviation passenger capacity is projected to grow at an average of 3.1% annually until 2028, a sharp decline from the 15.4% average annual growth rate in the decade leading up to 2019.

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, a major blow to his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred any future modifications, although the Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling. The decision applies to trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs imposed on numerous countries to address trade imbalances (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>As immigration enforcement intensifies in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly seeking naturalization.
