          <p>An Egyptian national was deported from the United States after pleading guilty to harming a law enforcement animal at Washington Dulles International Airport. The man violently kicked a 5-year-old CBP beagle named Freddy after the dog alerted officers to prohibited agricultural products in his luggage. The kick was forceful enough to lift the dog off the ground, causing bruising, though Freddy is expected to fully recover. The traveler was ordered to pay veterinary bills and was removed from the country following his guilty plea.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran. The measure, introduced by Senator Tim Kaine, failed despite growing Democratic concerns over the administration's lack of transparency regarding recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While the White House claims the strikes "severely damaged" Iran's program, some Democrats who received classified briefings remain skeptical of these assertions.

          <p>In the closing arguments of his federal trial, Sean "Diddy" Combs' lawyer portrayed him as the target of an overzealous prosecution that exaggerated a swinger lifestyle into a criminal conspiracy.

In rebuttal, the prosecution maintained that the trial was about Combs' "inexcusable behavior" and use of power and violence.

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision that gives a procedural victory to the Trump administration. In a 6-3 ruling, the court partially stayed injunctions against an executive order on birthright citizenship, but did not rule on the order's constitutionality. The decision means that while individual plaintiffs in the case remain protected, the administration can proceed with implementing its policy in other jurisdictions. Critics argue this weakens judicial checks on executive power, while supporters say it prevents overreach by single judges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Trump v. Casa, Inc. argues that the ruling dramatically expands the power of the presidency at the expense of judicial oversight. By curbing the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, the court has made it more difficult to block potentially unlawful executive orders from taking immediate effect across the country. This creates a scenario where constitutional rights could be enforced in a patchwork manner, depending on where lawsuits are filed. Critics, including dissenting justices, have called the decision a profound threat to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A Southern California man has been sentenced to over a year in federal prison for tax fraud connected to the sale of memorabilia signed by the late comic book creator Stan Lee. The man, who had a personal relationship with Lee, failed to report over $1.2 million in income from these sales to the IRS between 2015 and 2018. In addition to the prison sentence, he has been ordered to pay more than $480,000 in restitution. The case highlights the legal consequences of failing to report income from high-value collectibles.</p>

          <p>A decorated U.S. Army veteran, who was awarded a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in Panama, has self-deported to South Korea under threat of detention by immigration authorities. The veteran, a legal permanent resident since childhood, faced deportation due to drug convictions from nearly two decades ago, which he attributes to PTSD from his military service. Despite his honorable discharge and service record, his past felony conviction made him a target of recent immigration enforcement actions. His case has drawn attention to the plight of noncitizen veterans in the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>The political dynamics within the Republican party are showing signs of a revival of the fiscal conservatism that characterized the Tea Party movement of the early 2010s. Some original Tea Party-aligned officials, like Senator Rand Paul, are once again vocally opposing large spending proposals and tax cuts that are not matched by budget reductions, even when proposed by their own party. This emerging faction is creating internal conflict, challenging the party leadership and the Trump administration's economic plans. The situation mirrors the earlier movement's push for stricter fiscal discipline against the established party line.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced it will terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Haitian migrants, effective in early September. This decision will revoke the legal status and work permits for hundreds of thousands of Haitians who were allowed to live and work in the U.S. following Haiti's 2010 earthquake. The administration argues that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently for their return, a claim that contrasts with State Department travel advisories warning of instability and violence. Those affected will face deportation if they cannot secure another form of legal status.</p>
