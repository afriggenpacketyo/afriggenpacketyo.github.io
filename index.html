          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate to 4% from 4.25% following a tight 5–4 vote among its Monetary Policy Committee members. This decision reflects the central bank's ongoing challenge of balancing persistent inflation with signs of a cooling jobs market and slow economic growth. While policymakers remain committed to a "gradual and careful" approach, economists are divided on the future path of rate cuts, noting the conflicting economic data creates significant uncertainty. The U.K. Chancellor welcomed the move as beneficial for families and businesses facing high borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the deliberate use of starvation as a military tactic in Gaza, citing explicit statements from Israeli officials about imposing a "complete siege." It places the current crisis in the historical context of weaponized famine, such as in Leningrad and Bengal, but argues the Gaza situation is unique because the famine is entirely human-made and defies a readily available international aid capacity. The piece highlights that Israel's blockade on food, water, and fuel is a well-documented and systematic policy, constituting a war crime under international law. The humanitarian disaster has been exacerbated by unprecedented constraints on UN-coordinated aid groups.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly raised its 2025 financial forecast after reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by massive sales of its diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for fiscal year 2025. However, the company's stock fell after late-stage trial data for its experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron, failed to meet high investor expectations. CEO David Ricks expressed confidence in the company's future, highlighting that the strong performance positions it for continued growth despite potential market reactions.

          <p>The Trump administration's extensive new tariffs, with rates ranging from 10% to 41%, became effective on Thursday, impacting a wide array of goods from nearly 70 countries. Major U.S. trading partners like Canada face a 35% tariff, while Brazil is hit with a 40% rate on top of a 10% baseline. The White House stated the rates are based on trade deficits, but the move is expected to increase costs for American consumers, with one estimate suggesting an additional $2,400 burden per household this year. The administration has secured some trade agreements to reduce rates for allies like the UK, Vietnam, and Indonesia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's government and markets have shown minimal panic following the U.S. announcement of a 50% tariff on Indian goods, a move intended to penalize the country for its continued oil purchases from Russia. Indian officials and even opposition leaders view the tariffs as a pressure tactic, strengthening the government's resolve in ongoing trade negotiations, particularly concerning protections for its agricultural sector. While sectors like gems, jewelry, and textiles expect significant negative impacts, India's economy is bolstered by strong domestic consumption. Analysts believe India may adopt a "watch and wait" strategy, pending the outcome of potential U.S.-Russia talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article delves into the cultural phenomenon of survivalism, tracing its roots from 1970s counter-culture figures to modern-day billionaire "preppers." It distinguishes between the temporary condition of a survivor and the permanent identity of a survivalist, who often romanticizes societal collapse as a liberating adventure. The piece examines how this theme is portrayed in fiction, from "Robinson Crusoe" to "The Road," contrasting heroic problem-solving with the violent, misanthropic fantasies of some survivalist ideologies. It argues that while many stories present a bleak view of humanity post-catastrophe, real-world disasters often inspire cooperation and mutual aid rather than widespread brutality.</p>

Writing in the Study Times, Professor Cui Youping emphasized that maintaining this level of growth is crucial for laying a solid foundation for the long-term objective.

          <p>Nearly 30 years after D.C. police officer Denna Campbell was killed, her then-live-in boyfriend, Amir Jalil Ali, has been arrested and charged with her murder. Campbell was found shot five times in her Maryland apartment in 1995, a case Ali initially blamed on a burglary. Charges were filed against him at the time but were mysteriously dropped. Investigators reopened the cold case, noting that colleagues had reported Campbell feared Ali and had ominously warned that if she went missing, "you'll know he killed me." The arrest provides long-awaited resolution for Campbell's family and former colleagues.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur midfielder James Maddison is expected to be sidelined for the majority of the upcoming season after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The 28-year-old sustained the injury during a pre-season match against Newcastle in South Korea. Manager Thomas Frank confirmed it was the same knee that had kept Maddison out of the Europa League final in May. Following tests, the club's initial fears were confirmed, and the England international is now set to undergo surgery before beginning a long-term recovery program, dealing a significant blow to the team's plans.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted a high-risk medical evacuation of three people from McMurdo Station, an American research base in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was carried out in perilous conditions, including sub-zero temperatures and 24-hour winter darkness. U.S. officials, who called the operation "nothing short of heroic," had requested assistance due to insufficient medical resources at the remote base. The New Zealand crew used a C-130J Hercules aircraft and night vision goggles to land on a manually prepared ice runway, successfully transporting the patients back to Christchurch for care.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable is pioneering non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology embedded in everyday devices like headphones, which can measure brain activity to track focus and cognitive health. Unlike trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, this technology uses EEG sensors to monitor brainwaves directly, potentially detecting issues like depression or early-stage Alzheimer's years before symptoms appear. The company's first product, a pair of headphones, uses the data to help users improve attention, but the underlying platform could be licensed for various applications. This innovation points toward a future where common wearables could provide a continuous stream of data about our mental well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The president of the American Medical Association has described new federal student loan limits as a "punch in the face" for aspiring doctors. A provision in recent legislation caps lifetime federal borrowing at $200,000 for professional programs like medical school, where the average cost of attendance already exceeds that amount. Medical associations warn this will create a significant financial barrier, potentially deterring qualified candidates, especially from lower-income backgrounds, from pursuing a medical career. This could exacerbate the projected nationwide shortage of physicians by making medical education financially unattainable for many students. (not investment advice)</p>

While some companies welcomed the end of a period of anticipation, many are concerned that the lack of certainty is delaying investment and could negatively impact global growth.

          <p>The season premiere of the BBC's "MasterChef" drew just under two million viewers, a notable decrease from the 2.7 million who watched last year's launch. The new series is airing pre-recorded episodes featuring hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode, who were both sacked following a misconduct investigation. The BBC's decision to air the series has faced backlash, and critics have described the new episodes as awkward and lacking energy, speculating they were heavily re-edited to minimize the hosts' presence. The decline in viewership occurs amidst a general trend of falling terrestrial TV ratings.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk, a key indicator of global trade, has raised its full-year financial guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. CEO Vincent Clerc attributed the positive performance to resilient container demand and a manufacturing boom in China, with strong export growth observed "pretty much everywhere in the world except for the U.S." He noted that the uncertainty around U.S. tariffs has had a dampening effect on American demand. The company now expects global container market volume to grow between 2% and 4% in 2025, an upgrade from its previous forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newly released data from Homeland Security shows that arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles region dropped significantly in July compared to the previous month, though they remain higher than pre-operation levels. Federal agents made approximately 1,371 arrests in the past month, down from 2,792 in the month prior, following the launch of an aggressive deportation operation in June. This decrease is believed to be linked to a federal court order that blocked agents from making arrests without reasonable suspicion. Despite the drop, authorities conducted a raid at a Home Depot this week, signaling that enforcement actions are ongoing.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation aimed at making it easier for veterans to use their VA benefits for health care at private, local facilities, a practice known as community care. Proponents argue this is necessary for rural veterans who live far from VA hospitals or need services the VA cannot promptly provide. However, critics, including some Democrats and veterans' advocacy groups, worry that diverting more federal funds to the private sector could weaken the VA's own specialized care system. The debate centers on balancing convenience and choice for veterans with the need to maintain the integrity and funding of VA-run hospitals and clinics.</p>
