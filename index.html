          <p>A bomb exploded near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulting in one death and multiple injuries, with the FBI declaring it an intentional act of terrorism. The explosion, which occurred outside the American Reproductive Centers, caused significant damage to nearby buildings and shattered windows across several blocks. Authorities have identified a person of interest but have stated they are not actively searching for a suspect, and the motive behind the attack remains unclear. The clinic reported that none of its staff were harmed, and sensitive medical materials remained secure, though the office space sustained damage. The Palm Springs Police Chief assured the community that the area was no longer at risk and that the city would rise as a beacon of hope.</p>

          <p>A UK-EU summit is anticipated to pave the way for an agreement that could significantly reduce the impact of the Irish Sea border, with the UK seeking to reset its post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The summit is expected to yield an "agreement to agree" on trade issues, particularly concerning food and agricultural products, potentially leading to the removal of most physical checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. While this deal would not eliminate the sea border entirely, it could alleviate some of the challenges faced by businesses in Northern Ireland. The agreement could mean the end of 'Not for EU' labelling and the removal of most physical checks on goods.</p>

          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent engaged with hackers claiming responsibility for cyber attacks on M&S and Co-op, who provided evidence of stolen customer and employee data. The hackers, linked to a cyber crime service called DragonForce, expressed frustration with Co-op's response to their ransom demands. This interaction led Co-op to admit to a significant data breach, after initially downplaying the hack, and highlighted the increasing prevalence of ransomware-as-a-service. DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove indicated that a second Scottish independence referendum could be considered if there is overwhelming public support for it. While Gove doesn't believe another referendum is currently necessary, he cautioned against complacency and emphasized the need for politicians to demonstrate the effectiveness of the UK union. He linked the likelihood of a second vote to the SNP's ability to improve public services and garner demonstrable support for independence, aligning with First Minister John Swinney's stance on securing widespread backing before pursuing another referendum. Gove's comments suggest a potential shift in the UK government's approach based on public sentiment and the SNP's performance.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents, have seen a shift in public perception, potentially impacting their chances of parole. Initially portrayed as greedy killers, growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse has led to increased sympathy for their claims of abuse. New evidence and media portrayals have contributed to this shift, with figures like Kim Kardashian advocating for their freedom. A judge has reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, with the final decision resting on California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who will weigh public opinion against his own political ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions, significantly limiting its availability to the general population. This decision bucks norms established during the pandemic, as the FDA has not previously included health criteria for COVID shots. The approval requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart conditions associated with the vaccine, which could cost the company tens of millions of dollars. Experts express concern that these restrictions may hinder vaccine access and reflect skepticism toward vaccines within the health agencies.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings. The storm, fueled by dry soil and strong winds, created dramatic scenes in Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. Such dust storms are uncommon in this area, with the last significant event occurring during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. Meteorologists attributed the storm to thunderstorms that generated high winds, lifting dust from parched farmland and creating a phenomenon known as a haboob.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in intense negotiations before their first bilateral summit since Brexit, aiming to reset relations amidst global challenges. Discussions focus on a joint declaration addressing geopolitical issues, a security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While the UK seeks closer economic ties, the Labour government faces constraints due to Eurosceptic sentiments and red lines against rejoining the EU's customs union or single market. Key points of contention include fishing rights, access to EU defense contracts, and a youth mobility scheme, with both sides navigating complex political and economic considerations.</p>
