          <p>The Greer Fire in eastern Arizona has expanded to over 20,000 acres with 38% containment, prompting red flag warnings and evacuations in nearby communities. High winds, reaching around 40 mph, have posed significant challenges for the over 700 personnel assigned to battle the blaze, which started on May 13th. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs declared a state of emergency in Apache County due to the growing flames, and an investigation into the cause of the fire is underway. Residents are urged to avoid activities that could spark additional fires under the current conditions, with more information to be provided to the public on Monday evening regarding the fire's growth and evacuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 30-year yield briefly topping 5%, following Moody's downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit and high interest rates. Despite initial investor concerns, bond buying drove yields lower from their highs, but long-term Treasury yields have returned to levels that previously caused financial panic. Deutsche Bank analysts noted that Moody's downgrade was a major symbolic move, aligning them with other major credit rating agencies that had already given the U.S. their second-highest rating. These rates impact loans for houses and credit cards (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to remove temporary protected status from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants, potentially allowing for deportations to move forward. The court's unsigned order permits the administration to end the protections pending appeal, though it clarifies that individual immigrants can still bring legal challenges in some instances, such as if the government tries to cancel their work permits. This decision reverses a lower court's ruling that had blocked the administration's plan, with a lawyer representing the immigrants calling the Supreme Court's decision "truly shocking." The Temporary Protected Status program allows migrants from nations experiencing disasters or conflicts to live and work legally in the United States.</p>

          <p>A 400-pound grizzly bear was trapped and killed by Yellowstone National Park staff after it repeatedly overturned bear-resistant dumpsters and pulled trash cans from their concrete bases in search of human garbage near Old Faithful and other busy areas. Park officials stated that the bear posed a risk to public safety, and efforts to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food were unsuccessful in this case. The last time a bear was killed by park staff in a management action was in 2017, and grizzly bears are protected in the U.S. as a threatened species.</p>

Officials have increased the reward for information leading to the capture of each inmate to $20,000, and authorities believe members of the public may be aiding the men. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has ordered an audit of the sheriff's office and the Orleans Parish Prison, calling the escape the worst in recent state history. Three jail staff members have been suspended without pay pending the outcome of an internal investigation, and authorities have notified neighboring states.</p>

          <p>Israel has allowed five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza after an 11-week blockade, a move welcomed by the UN as a "drop in the ocean" of what's needed for the 2.1 million Palestinians in the war-torn territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited pressure from allies in the US Senate as the reason for allowing the minimal amount of food, stating the need to avoid famine. Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes have killed at least 40 people across Gaza, and the military has ordered the evacuation of Khan Younis in preparation for an "unprecedented attack." Netanyahu has also warned that Israeli forces would take control of all areas of Gaza.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer, it's important to understand the disease, its symptoms, screening methods, and treatment options. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men, with early detection often occurring through regular exams rather than symptom occurrence. Screening involves PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams, and treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer. While metastatic prostate cancer is not curable, it is treatable, with survival rates having increased significantly over the last three decades.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates surged higher after Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, with the average rate on the 30-year fixed loan hitting 7.04%, the highest level since April 11. The April surge in mortgage rates had a direct effect on the housing market, causing it to pull back right in the heart of the usually busy spring season. Homebuilder sentiment is now at the lowest level since the end of 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders' monthly index.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to remove legal protections for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans now living in the U.S., under a program that had protected them from deportation known as Temporary Protected Status.

A federal judge paused the administration's plans on TPS a week before it was scheduled to end, resulting in the Trump administration filing an emergency application to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging the authority of courts by seeking to limit the use of nationwide injunctions, which are used to stop unlawful executive actions. The administration argues that judges should only be able to bar executive orders with respect to individual parties, allowing the government to continue violating the constitutional rights of others. Critics argue that this approach would turn the justice system into a "catch me if you can" regime, where the executive branch can violate rights until each individual files a lawsuit. The administration's stance is seen as an effort to run riot over the Constitution indefinitely.</p>

A report from First Street indicates that annualized climate-driven foreclosures could result in billions in bank losses, and if lenders start factoring climate into their underwriting, a consumer's credit score could fall or rise depending on the risk to their property. The study notes that lender losses today are primarily in just three states: California, Florida and Louisiana (not investment advice).</p>
