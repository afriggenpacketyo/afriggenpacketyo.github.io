          <h2>Japan Postpones US Trip Amid Tariff Deal Disagreement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, abruptly postponed a trip to Washington, citing unresolved issues regarding a tariffs deal with the Trump administration. Tokyo is pressing the U.S. to swiftly implement a 15% tariff on most Japanese goods, a reduction from an earlier 25% rate, and to refund previously overpaid import duties. The dispute arose when Japanese officials realized the preliminary agreement would add the 15% tariff on top of existing ones, leading to their strong objection. This delay underscores the persistent complexities and sensitivities in bilateral trade negotiations, with Japan emphasizing the deal's critical importance for the economic security of both nations. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, indicated readiness to finalize the agreement, which includes a substantial Japanese investment pledge in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Rwanda has accepted a first group of seven individuals from the US as part of a new deportation agreement, with four opting to stay and three wishing to return to their home countries. This deal allows Rwanda to vet each proposed individual and offers them training, healthcare, and accommodation. The Trump administration defends these third-country deportations as necessary, particularly when home nations refuse deportees. However, human rights experts warn such arrangements risk violating international law by sending people to countries where they could face abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK-made car sales to the US saw a 6.8% rise in July, reversing a three-month decline, following the implementation of a revised UK-US tariff deal. Initially, President Trump had hiked import taxes on UK cars to 27.5%, causing industry shockwaves, before it was lowered to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) highlighted the deal's impact, noting the US remains the largest single market for British-built cars, especially premium brands. Despite this positive shift in exports, overall UK car manufacturing continues to struggle due to higher labor costs, increased competition, and Brexit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive Russian drone and missile attack struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killing at least 14 people, including three children, and wounding dozens. President Zelenskyy condemned the "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians," urging a firm global response and new sanctions against Russia for its refusal to negotiate. This attack, one of the largest since the 2022 invasion, comes weeks after President Trump met with Vladimir Putin to discuss peace, with few details emerging since. Ukraine's forces reportedly intercepted most of the 629 incoming weapons, but many civilian buildings were damaged, intensifying calls for stronger international pressure.</p>

          <p>Clay Travis argues that the NFL's continued use of "woke" end zone messages like "End Racism" feels outdated and out of touch with fans who prefer a focus on football. He suggests that if the league insists on political statements, it should add "Back the Blue" as an option to support police. Travis criticizes Colin Kaepernick's past statements about police and Commissioner Roger Goodell's endorsement, linking these actions to a rise in murder rates during the "Black Lives Matter era." The author believes supporting law enforcement is crucial for public safety and would help repair the league's relationship with police.</p>

          <p>A new Stanford study indicates that generative AI tools like ChatGPT are primarily displacing entry-level workers in AI-exposed fields such as software engineering and customer service, showing a 13% employment drop since 2022 for early-career employees. More experienced workers in these sectors, and those in less AI-exposed fields, have seen employment growth. Economists suggest older workers possess valuable tacit knowledge and soft skills less susceptible to AI replacement. While AI will eliminate some jobs, it also creates others and can augment human work, emphasizing the importance for young professionals to learn effective AI utilization to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis during a morning Mass, marking the first week of school, resulted in the deaths of two children, aged 8 and 10, and injuries to 17 others.

Authorities recovered additional weapons and writings linked to the shooter, whose motive remains undetermined, though the FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and an anti-Catholic hate crime. The quick and heroic actions of school staff to move students under pews are credited with preventing a significantly higher casualty count in this horrific event.</p>

Critics argue it facilitated unsafe or counterfeit goods and unfairly favored foreign companies, while proponents cite lower consumer prices.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson's recent megabill, which includes significant Medicaid cuts, is expected to deeply impact his rural Louisiana district, where over a third of residents rely on the program. The new law will require adults aged 19-55 to prove 80 hours of monthly work or training to maintain coverage, potentially causing thousands to lose benefits and threatening the closure of federally qualified health centers. Constituents express worry over meeting these requirements, especially those with unreliable work. While Johnson defends the changes as targeting "waste, fraud, and abuse," the Congressional Budget Office estimates 12 million people nationwide could lose healthcare coverage.</p>

Despite the board's "amazingly supportive" stance and a belief in patience, the team shows no discernible improvement, with new recruits failing to perform. The manager's decisions, like benching captain James Tavernier, are questioned as the team's defensive frailties and overall confusion persist, heading into a crucial Old Firm game.</p>

          <p>A unique and widely praised photograph of seventh-seed Jasmine Paolini at the US Open has been hailed as potentially one of the best tennis photos ever. Photographer Ray Giubilo captured the "half terrifying and half sublime" image by fluke, attributing its perfection to Paolini being off-balance during a forehand stroke. Giubilo, who spends seven months a year covering tennis, recognized the shot's greatness instantly, and Paolini herself expressed admiration. This rare, humorous image stands out in a sport known for intense but rarely comedic photography, showcasing the blend of patience, creative flair, and impeccable technical ability required in sports photography.</p>

Walters, who replaced Mal Meninga, aims to instill his winning mentality, honed over a decorated playing and coaching career, into the team. The three-Test series in England, scheduled for October and November, is anticipated to generate considerable interest and reignite the historic rivalry, with Walters confident in his strong squad and the unique experience for his players.</p>

The 2022 leak, now estimated to cost £850m, exposed individuals at risk from the Taliban.

Despite this success, the company continues to navigate US-China trade tensions, including a recent US government review of licenses for its H20 chips designed for China.

          <p>The widespread emotional reaction to Taylor Swift's engagement, with fans expressing immense joy and tears online, highlights the phenomenon of "parasocial relationships"—one-sided friendships with celebrities. Psychologists note that constant exposure to celebrities' private lives through reality shows and social media creates a powerful illusion of intimacy, fulfilling a fundamental human need for connection. While these relationships can foster a sense of community among fans and offer a welcome distraction from negative news, experts like Arthur C. Brooks caution they lack "nutritional content" and cannot genuinely replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. The article suggests that while being happy for a star is harmless, genuine emotional support and connection require mutual interaction.</p>

UK business owners and industry groups are urging swifter action, arguing the exemption unfairly undercuts High Street retailers and exposes consumers to potentially unsafe products. While removing the loophole could hit lower-income consumers, the Treasury's ongoing review aims to balance business support with consumer impact. (not investment advice)</p>
