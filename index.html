          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a trade agreement, averting a potential trade war. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on all EU goods imported into the US, a compromise from the 30% rate President Trump had previously threatened. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump announced the framework in Scotland, highlighting it as a move to stabilize the economic relationship between the two major partners. The agreement also includes a commitment from the EU to invest $600 billion in the US and purchase $750 billion in American energy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid growing concerns over imported pets. The charity warns that thousands of dogs are brought in from countries like Romania and Ukraine with minimal vetting, leading to issues such as infectious diseases and severe aggression. This unregulated process, likened to a "Deliveroo for dogs," has resulted in rising cases of Brucella canis, a disease transmissible to humans, and tragic incidents where owners were attacked. Experts argue the lack of proper assessment creates a "ticking time bomb" for both animal and public health.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun implementing daily 10-hour "tactical pauses" in parts of Gaza to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. This move comes in response to mounting international pressure and severe warnings of famine in the region. Aid agencies, including the UN, have welcomed the measure but stress that a full ceasefire is necessary to address the widespread hunger crisis affecting Gaza's 2.1 million residents. Despite the pause, Israeli military operations continue in other areas, and recent strikes have resulted in further Palestinian casualties, highlighting the fragile nature of the humanitarian corridor.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his status among cycling's elite. Despite having already secured the overall victory, Pogačar launched a characteristic attack during the final stage in Paris, even on dangerously wet roads, ultimately finishing fourth in the stage itself. The 26-year-old finished the grueling race 4 minutes and 24 seconds ahead of two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard. This victory marks another milestone in Pogačar's decorated career, which includes a Giro d'Italia title, making him the first rider since 1998 to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same season.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to issue adequate warnings during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which killed over 55,000 people. The system could have sent its highest-level "Take Action" alert to 10 million people near the epicenter, providing up to 35 seconds of warning, but sent only 469. The system severely underestimated the quake's magnitude, and a subsequent simulation with an improved algorithm showed it should have sent millions of alerts. This revelation has prompted concerns from scientists about the transparency and reliability of such technologies, which some countries may be over-relying on for public safety.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his sharp, witty songs in the 1950s and 1960s, has passed away at the age of 97. Lehrer rose to fame with his clever and often controversial piano-led tunes that targeted subjects like politics, nuclear war, and pollution, before he largely retired from public performance to focus on his career as a mathematics professor. His work, including songs like "The Vatican Rag" and "Pollution," had a profound influence on generations of comedy songwriters, who praised his ability to blend humor with biting social commentary. He was remembered by many, including "Weird Al" Yankovic, as a comedic hero.</p>

Martinez-Avila now faces multiple charges, including homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle. ICE has lodged a detainer against her, with a DHS official criticizing the jurisdiction for a history of not honoring such detainers, which they claim leads to the release of dangerous individuals.</p>

He explained that "bombing" on stage is a crucial part of the craft, asserting that comedians learn more from struggling through a difficult performance than from a successful one. Oliver, whose career was launched in the stand-up world, views failure as a vital tutor that helps performers refine their material and grow.</p>

Government agencies and museums dedicated to preserving the memory of the country's military dictatorship (1976-1983), such as the National Archive of Remembrance, have seen their staff significantly reduced. These organizations, including the renowned Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, which identifies children stolen during the dictatorship, rely on government subsidies that are now in jeopardy.

          <p>An investigative report details the discovery of a Skyvan PA-51 aircraft used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," where political prisoners were thrown alive into the Atlantic Ocean. The search was spearheaded by Italian photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo and Argentine journalist Miriam Lewin, herself a survivor of a detention camp. By tracking down the plane's flight logs in the U.S., they found irrefutable evidence of these missions, including a specific flight that corresponded to the disappearance of a group of mothers and French nuns in 1977. This evidence proved crucial in a historic 2017 trial, leading to life sentences for the pilots.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man, Bradford James Gille, has been charged with terrorism and assault with intent to murder after stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The victims, six women and five men aged 21 to 84, were attacked randomly with a folding knife but are all expected to survive. Authorities stated that the terrorism charge is justified because the mass attack was intended to inflict fear upon the entire community. When police arrived, armed citizens were already confronting the suspect in the parking lot, preventing him from causing further harm before he was taken into custody.</p>

          <p>Marvel's latest superhero film, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," has made a powerful debut at the North American box office, earning an estimated $118 million in its opening weekend. This marks the fourth-largest opening of the year and the biggest for a Marvel film since last summer's "Deadpool & Wolverine." The film, which features a retro-futuristic 1960s setting, also grossed $100 million internationally, bringing its global total to $218 million. Analysts suggest that the strong performance of this film, along with DC's "Superman," indicates that audience appetite for superhero movies remains high, challenging the narrative of "superhero fatigue."</p>

The author suggests that policymakers should now focus on creating a cohesive low-carbon tourism corridor that links cities through clean and smart travel options.
