          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures potentially reaching 31°C. Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales all recorded their warmest day of the year so far, while parts of England saw highs above 33°C. Amber heat health alerts are active for several regions in England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The intense heat has led to hosepipe bans and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland, with relief expected on Monday as cooler air and rain are forecasted for most of the country.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its decades-long armed conflict with Turkey, initiating a disarmament process. This move, prompted by a call from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, is seen as a significant step toward peace, though the PKK's full dissolution depends on concessions from the Turkish government. Key demands include Ocalan's release, legal reforms for other Kurdish political prisoners, and amnesty for fighters. A successful peace process could improve Turkey's relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria, enhancing its overall stability and influence in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>While installing a water pipeline in the Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia, workers discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded in the seabed, approximately 30 inches below the ocean floor. Marine archaeologists have confirmed the shipwreck dates back to the late 1700s based on radiocarbon analysis. The discovery in the historic city, famous as a filming location for "Game of Thrones," adds to a series of recent maritime archaeological finds across Europe, and the remains are being protected for further study.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing a challenging business climate, some of China's five-star luxury hotels are adapting by selling budget-friendly street food to survive. For instance, the Zhongwu Hotel in Changzhou has started offering meal boxes with local favorites like braised dishes and spicy crayfish for as little as 20 yuan (US$3). This strategy marks a significant shift from their usual high-end banquet services, reflecting a broader trend of businesses adjusting to changing consumer habits and economic pressures. The move highlights the necessity for even premium brands to prioritize survival and cash flow in the current market.</p>

          <p>Talks are scheduled for next week between UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the British Medical Association (BMA) to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike, set to begin on July 25th, stems from a pay dispute, with doctors arguing their real-terms pay is 20% lower than in 2008. The government has offered a 5.4% increase for this year but insists it cannot improve the offer, while the BMA will only call off the strike if a credible new proposal is made. Public support for the strikes has reportedly fallen, and the action could significantly impact NHS waiting lists.</p>

Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event united nearly 2 billion viewers and featured legendary music acts. However, looking back, the event faces criticism for its lack of diversity, featuring no African performers on its main stages and reinforcing a "white savior" narrative of Africa. While it successfully raised millions and influenced global aid policy, its legacy is now viewed as complex, balancing its positive impact with valid questions about representation.</p>

MP Becky Gittins and families affected by severe allergies argue that allergens should be clearly marked in plain language, similar to food packaging standards.

In a recent trial, Araujo, who took a plea deal, testified against Abell, claiming he led the brutal attack that resulted in Seiden's death.

The opposition Perikatan Nasional, which includes the conservative Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial ground, particularly among younger and more conservative Malay voters. This "green wave" is pushing for policies aligned with a stricter Islamic ideology, creating tension in the multi-ethnic, Muslim-majority nation. While some see this as a genuine societal trend, others view it as political posturing, posing a challenge to the country's traditionally more moderate political landscape.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow for India</h2>

          <p>A new study examining the impact of China's dams on the Brahmaputra River suggests they may alleviate, rather than worsen, India's dry-season water concerns. Contrary to fears that a new mega dam in Tibet could cause a water crisis, data from two existing upstream dams shows a significant increase in water levels downstream during the dry season. Measurements taken since 2014 indicate that low flows in February rose by more than 50%. This research provides the first concrete evidence on the downstream effects, hinting that the dams' regulation of water may actually help prevent droughts.</p>

          <p>After weeks of requests and a lawsuit, Florida lawmakers toured the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades. Democratic lawmakers described the conditions as "appalling," citing extreme heat in the medical area, small food portions, and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction with the conditions. The facility, built in just eight days, has been at the center of a debate over its suitability and the treatment of the people detained there.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have voiced strong criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1st. Mexico's president called the plan an "unfair deal," while the EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, threatened "proportionate countermeasures" if necessary. Both parties, however, expressed a desire to continue negotiations to avoid a trade war. The proposed tariffs are part of a broader U.S. trade strategy that has also targeted Japan, South Korea, and other nations, with President Trump insisting the measures are necessary to address trade deficits.

          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained during a federal immigration raid on a cannabis farm in Camarillo, California, where authorities arrested over 300 people. The raids, which also targeted a farm in Carpinteria, were conducted based on criminal warrants related to the employment of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. The operations led to tense standoffs between protesters and federal agents, with several U.S. citizens arrested for assault. A federal judge has since issued a temporary order to halt such raids in Southern California, responding to a lawsuit from civil rights groups.</p>

          <p>Two people are reported missing in Spain's Catalonia region after torrential rains caused severe flooding. Firefighters are searching along the Foix river for the missing individuals near the town of Cubelles. The national weather service issued a red "extreme risk" alert for Catalonia and Aragon, with heavy rainfall causing widespread travel disruptions, including blocked roads and a temporary suspension of all regional train services. The extreme weather, caused by a "cold drop" phenomenon, has prompted the prime minister to urge caution and deploy military emergency units to assist.</p>
