          <p>The New York Knicks are reportedly considering Jason Kidd to fill their head coaching vacancy after parting ways with Tom Thibodeau. The Knicks would need to request permission from the Dallas Mavericks, as Kidd is currently under contract with them. Kidd was previously interviewed for the Knicks' head coaching job in 2020, which ultimately went to Thibodeau, who led the team to their first Eastern Conference finals berth since 2000. Kidd, who spent the final season of his NBA career with the Knicks, has prior coaching experience with the Nets and the Bucks, as well as serving as an assistant coach for the Lakers. </p>

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in numerous deaths, occurring during Eid al-Adha. Humanitarian groups, including UNICEF, are raising alarms about the rapidly deteriorating conditions for children, with malnutrition rates nearly tripling compared to earlier in the year. James Elder of UNICEF described a "man-made nutritional crisis," noting a lack of basic medical supplies, including painkillers, and highlighted the challenges in aid distribution due to restrictions and security concerns. He also criticized the use of aid as 'bait' at distribution points run by military contractors where children have been killed while trying to access it. </p>

Doomscrolling, especially when starting the day or before bed, can increase anxiety, disrupt sleep, and promote sedentary behavior.
