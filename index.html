        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain is reportedly poised to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the U.S. after the U.S. announced tariffs against various trading partners. The New York Times reported that President Trump hinted at a forthcoming trade deal announcement, though specifics remain unclear. The deal's potential scope, whether a finalized agreement or a framework for future negotiations, is yet to be confirmed. The UK was spared reciprocal tariffs when Trump announced his 'Liberation Day' duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting migrants to Libya would violate a previous court order, following reports that the Trump administration considered such plans. Lawyers for the migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing safety risks. Judge Murphy clarified that removals to countries like Libya or Saudi Arabia would defy his injunction, emphasizing the likelihood of imprisonment, torture, or death for those deported to Libya. The ruling follows reports of the administration deporting alleged gang members to El Salvador as part of a $6 million deal, and the Laotian, Vietnamese, and Philippine immigrants are at risk of removal.</p>

The missiles traveled up to 800 kilometers before landing in the sea, prompting close communication between South Korea, the United States, and Japan. This launch marks North Korea's sixth missile test in 2025, violating UN Security Council resolutions.

          <p>Senator John Fetterman reportedly exhibited alarming behavior during a meeting with union officials, including repeating himself, shouting, and slamming his hands on a desk. The incident occurred shortly before a New York Magazine article highlighted concerns about his mental health. The article cited a letter from Fetterman's former chief of staff detailing erratic behavior and potential non-compliance with his recovery plan. Fetterman's office dismissed the story as a ‚Äúone-source hit piece,‚Äù but the incident has fueled questions about his well-being and fitness for office.</p>

          <p>New York City Police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia University after they occupied Butler Library, mirroring earlier protests.

The university stated that the protesters will face disciplinary consequences for disrupting academic activities, while Representative Elise Stefanik criticized the university for allowing antisemitism. The protests occurred amidst ongoing tensions and debates over the university's handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and federal funding cuts due to concerns about campus safety.</p>
