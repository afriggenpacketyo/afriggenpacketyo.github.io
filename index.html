          <p>In a joint statement, 25 countries have called for an immediate cessation of the war in Gaza, describing the civilian suffering as having reached "new depths." The nations explicitly condemned Israel's aid delivery model as dangerous and unacceptable, accusing it of not complying with international humanitarian law by denying sufficient assistance. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the statement, asserting it is "disconnected from reality" and wrongly places pressure on Israel instead of Hamas, whom they hold responsible for prolonging the conflict.</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a move seen as a strategic overture to Beijing. Effective Tuesday, Chinese citizens holding valid U.S. or European Union visas can enter Argentina for tourism or business without needing a separate Argentine visa. This policy shift occurs as President Javier Milei's government navigates complex foreign relations, particularly amid delayed trade talks with the United States and growing American unease over Argentina's strengthening ties with China.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned the 2017 murder conviction of Pedro Hernandez for the 1979 killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City. The court ruled that the trial judge gave "clearly wrong" and prejudicial instructions to the jury regarding confessions Hernandez made to the police, mandating a new trial. This decision reopens one of the nation's most infamous missing child cases, which profoundly influenced law enforcement practices and parental awareness of child safety.</p>

While players currently receive about 9.3% of league revenue, they are fighting for a structure closer to the NBA's approximate 50/50 split.</p>

          <p>Community bail funds, which use donations to pay bail for those who cannot afford it, are facing increased legislative scrutiny and restrictions from Republican lawmakers. This backlash follows a surge in their number and popularity since the 2020 protests. Critics cite public safety concerns, while proponents argue the funds are a vital expression of community solidarity and a proven, data-driven alternative to a cash bail system that disproportionately harms the poor while they await trial.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has successfully signed Cameroon international winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal worth an initial £65 million, plus add-ons.

Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, expressed his excitement at joining what he called "the club of his dreams" and will wear the number 19 shirt.</p>

          <p>In a scathing letter titled "The Voyager Declaration," nearly 300 current and former NASA employees, including astronauts, have formally opposed the Trump administration's deep cuts to the agency. The signatories warn that the indiscriminate reductions to grants, staffing, and missions are undermining safety protocols established after the Columbia disaster and threaten U.S. leadership in science and technology. The letter accuses the administration of prioritizing political momentum over safety, scientific progress, and the efficient use of public funds.</p>

          <p>This analytical article from The Atlantic argues that the term "criminal alien," frequently used by the Trump administration, is a dangerous and misleading slander with racist origins. The piece traces the term's legislative roots to a 1929 eugenics-backed law designed to exclude Mexicans, and it contrasts the administration's harsh rhetoric with data showing immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born citizens. It critiques the use of such language to justify inhumane detention conditions and a massive expansion of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded on social media that the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians revert to their previous, controversial Native American-themed names. He claimed, without evidence, that "great Indian people, in massive numbers" want the change to restore their "heritage and prestige." The article analyzes the situation, concluding that while Trump could create political pressure, it is highly unlikely he has the legal authority to force either privately-owned sports franchise to change its name.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from Deutsche Welle suggests President Donald Trump's administration is increasingly using tariffs for objectives traditionally pursued through sanctions. Instead of just protecting domestic industry, tariffs are being threatened or imposed to pressure countries like Mexico, Canada, and Brazil on non-trade issues such as immigration and the prosecution of political allies. This "tariff tango" approach creates significant global economic uncertainty and blurs the distinction between trade policy and punitive foreign policy measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies and tariff uncertainty are causing significant economic harm to smaller, secondary U.S. ports from California to the Gulf Coast. As shippers rush to import goods before tariff deadlines, they are consolidating shipments and rerouting them through the nation's largest ports, like Los Angeles, to increase efficiency. This has led to a sharp decline in container volumes and scheduled services for smaller ports such as Oakland, New Orleans, and Charleston, threatening local jobs and economies.

These actions, collectively, represent a significant escalation from rhetoric to a systematic campaign to undermine the Fourth Estate using the full power of the presidency.</p>
