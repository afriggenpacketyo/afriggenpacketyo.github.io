            <h2>Nvidia Faces $5.5 Billion Impact Due to US Chip Export Restrictions to China</h2>

            <p>Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion financial setback as the US government tightens chip export regulations to China amidst escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The new rules require licenses for exporting Nvidia's H20 AI chip, a popular product in China, raising concerns about a potential decoupling of US and Chinese AI semiconductor supply chains. Counterpoint Research suggests this impact is manageable for Nvidia and could be a negotiating tactic, though some expect exemptions or tariff policy changes soon. The company's value had previously dipped when a rival Chinese AI app demonstrated similar capabilities at a lower cost.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has warned the Trump administration over its inaction in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national wrongly deported to El Salvador, demanding evidence within two weeks of efforts to facilitate his return. Judge Paula Xinis has ordered four Homeland Security officials to answer questions under oath, citing a lack of progress despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his release. The administration claims Ábrego García has gang ties and would be detained if he returns to the US, while his legal team denies these allegations and accuses the administration of playing political games with his life.</p>

            <p>Figma, a design software company, has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the SEC, more than a year after a $20 billion acquisition deal with Adobe was terminated due to regulatory concerns. The announcement comes at a precarious time for the tech IPO market, which has been largely dormant since late 2021, with other companies delaying or withdrawing their IPO plans due to market turmoil. Founded in 2012, Figma's software is popular among designers who need to collaborate on website and app prototypes and had approximately $600 million in annual revenue as of early last year.

            <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered his first public remarks since leaving office, focusing on Social Security and urging unity, while indirectly criticizing the Trump administration's policies. He assailed President Trump's administration but did not name Mr. Trump directly. He touted his administration's efforts to cut Social Security fraud, and mocked claims by the Trump administration — including Mr. Trump's cost-cutting czar Elon Musk — that scores of implausibly old people are collecting payments.

Researchers believe vape users are transitioning to refillable and rechargeable devices. The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has nearly halved in the last year, dropping from 63% to 35%, according to University College London (UCL) research. Overall vaping use stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16, after several years of significant growth.</p>

            <p>Nvidia projects a $5.5 billion charge related to the US government's requirement for licenses to export H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations. The US government told Nvidia it would require a license to export the chips to China and a handful of other countries. This development signals that Nvidia's growth may be impacted by export restrictions on its chips, which the US government says can be used to create supercomputers for military uses. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has noted increased competition in China.</p>

            <p>President Trump has raised the idea of sending US citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons, but legal experts say such a move would be unconstitutional. Experts cite various constitutional provisions that would prevent the president from sending American criminals to prisons in other nations. Concerns have been raised about potential violations of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The comments come amid the ongoing legal battle surrounding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.</p>

            <p>The New Orleans Saints have won a trademark case against a man claiming to be a descendant of French royalty, who sought to control the fleur-de-lis symbol. A US appeals court ruled that Michel J Messier had no standing to challenge the team's trademark, as he failed to demonstrate any commercial interest or damage from its use. The court emphasized that Messier's claims of ancestral ties to European monarchs did not establish a legal basis for challenging the Saints' trademark, which has been in place since 1974.</p>
