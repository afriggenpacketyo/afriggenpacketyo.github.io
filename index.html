          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a socialist candidate for mayor of New York City, released a statement on the freeing of Israeli hostages from Gaza after facing public criticism for his initial silence. His message acknowledged the reuniting of Israeli and Palestinian families but did not mention President Trump's role in the negotiations, drawing further critique from political opponents. Mamdani's statement framed the event as a "glimmer of hope" for a lasting ceasefire and called for an examination of U.S. policies regarding the conflict. The article highlights the polarized political reactions to the hostage release within the context of the NYC mayoral race.</p>

          <p>As Beijing formulates its 15th five-year plan, there is a growing focus on the evolving economic relationship between mainland China and Taiwan, particularly in high-tech sectors. A recent delegation of Taiwanese executives, including from major firms like Delta Electronics, visited a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer to explore potential partnerships. This visit highlights a shift where Taiwanese companies are increasingly acting as specialized component suppliers for prominent mainland industries. The development signals potential opportunities for deeper cross-strait industrial integration, even amidst ongoing political tensions between the two governments.</p>

          <p>A small, single-engine plane crashed onto Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, resulting in the deaths of the two occupants, identified as a married couple from Rhode Island. The aircraft, which had departed from New Bedford Regional Airport, broke apart and burst into flames upon impact in the highway's median. A driver on the highway sustained non-life-threatening injuries after their car was struck by a piece of the wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, with poor weather from a regional nor'easter being considered a potential factor.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace face significant premium increases if pandemic-era subsidies are not renewed by the end of the year. The issue has become a central point of contention in government shutdown negotiations, with Democrats insisting on their extension. Health policy experts warn that failure to renew the tax credits could cause millions to lose their coverage, with residents of Republican-led states that did not expand Medicaid being disproportionately affected. Families who rely on the subsidies describe them as a financial lifeline and express deep anxiety over the potential cost hikes.</p>

          <p>Several prominent news organizations, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have announced they will not comply with a new Pentagon policy that restricts journalistic access. The new rules require reporters to pledge not to obtain unauthorized information and limit unescorted access within the Pentagon. Media groups and the Pentagon Press Association have condemned the policy as an infringement on First Amendment rights, arguing it is designed to intimidate sources and stifle a free press. A Pentagon spokesperson defended the policy as necessary for national security and criticized reporters for their reaction.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Egypt, U.S. President Donald Trump, alongside leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, signed a declaration formalizing a peace agreement to end the two-year conflict in Gaza. Trump celebrated the moment as the start of a new era of rebuilding and praised regional leaders for their role in brokering the truce between Israel and Hamas. The deal's first phase involves the exchange of the final 20 living Israeli hostages for 250 Palestinian prisoners and over 1,700 detainees. During the summit, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, the nation's highest honor.</p>

          <p>A UK security minister has rejected claims that the government intentionally sabotaged the prosecution of two men accused of spying for China.

The opposition Conservative party accused the government of refusing to provide vital information to "curry favour" with Beijing. The minister countered that the national security adviser was not involved in evidence decisions and blamed the case's collapse on outdated legislation.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's recent executive order on "Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence" creates a dangerous framework for suppressing free expression. The author contends that the order, building on a previous designation of antifa as a terrorist group, could be used to weaponize federal law enforcement against political opponents in Democratic-led cities. This could involve using Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate protest organizers and chill lawful dissent under the guise of counterterrorism. The author warns this represents an escalation that erodes civil liberties and militarizes the domestic landscape.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump, present in the region for a peace summit, hailed the development as a "historic dawn in a new Middle East."

          <p>Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk stated he is confident that OpenAI can afford its massive cloud computing expenses, which could reach $60 billion annually. His comments came after OpenAI signed a five-year deal with Oracle worth over $300 billion to rent cloud infrastructure, primarily for running its AI models on Nvidia chips. OpenAI's ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, demonstrating unprecedented growth that Oracle believes justifies the expenditure. Oracle has also begun integrating OpenAI's technology into its own products, particularly for its electronic health records business acquired from Cerner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been convicted of first-degree murder for her role in the 2014 killing of her former son-in-law, law professor Daniel Markel. Prosecutors successfully argued that Adelson orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot after Markel won a custody battle that prevented his ex-wife, Adelson's daughter, from moving their children to South Florida. Adelson is the fifth person to be convicted in connection with the case, which has drawn national attention for over a decade. Her son, Charles Adelson, is already serving a life sentence for his involvement in the plot.</p>

          <p>The U.S. supply chain is facing new economic headwinds as the government imposes additional tariffs on Chinese-made port equipment, including cranes and terminal tractors. The U.S. Trade Representative announced modifications that could raise the tariff rate on some machinery to as high as 270%. This comes ahead of new port fees on Chinese-made freight vessels, creating further cost pressures for importers and port authorities. Industry groups have expressed concern that these taxes will make necessary equipment unaffordable, hindering supply chain expansion and ultimately raising costs for businesses and consumers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ecuador has developed a unique style of cumbia music by blending traditional Andean rhythms with the rural Colombian cumbia that arrived via the record industry in the 1960s. Pioneers like Polibio Mayorga tropicalized the stigmatized sounds of the Ecuadorian highlands, creating a new identity for migrants in urban centers. Later, orchestras led by musicians such as Medardo Luzuriaga popularized the genre nationwide, creating a lasting musical legacy. Today, the genre continues to evolve with forms like tecnocumbia, performed by popular all-female groups that mix Indigenous rhythms from Ecuador and Peru into a mass-market, danceable sound.</p>
