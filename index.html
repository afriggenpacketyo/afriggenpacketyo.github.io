          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly leveraging relationships with Brazil and China to advance a peace plan for the war in Ukraine, discussing the initiative in a call with Brazilian President Lula da Silva. The Kremlin highlighted Brazil's role in the 'Group of Friends for Peace,' a joint effort with China. However, this peace push faces significant opposition from Ukraine, which has previously rejected the proposal, accusing Beijing and Brasilia of aligning with Moscow's interests. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized the plan, suggesting it would only serve to prolong the conflict by benefiting Russia.</p>

This move is seen as a vote of confidence for the U.S. chipmaker, which has faced challenges in capitalizing on the AI boom and developing its manufacturing business. The investment comes as Intel navigates a CEO transition and heightened attention from Washington regarding its critical role in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. SoftBank's investment reflects a belief in the expansion of advanced chip manufacturing within the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed concern that the United States may be underestimating China's rapid progress in artificial intelligence, cautioning that export controls on semiconductors are not a foolproof solution. Altman suggested that the U.S.-China AI competition is complex and multifaceted, involving research, product development, and manufacturing capacity. He also revealed that competition from Chinese open-source models was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models. This strategic shift aims to prevent the global AI ecosystem from becoming predominantly reliant on Chinese technology.</p>

          <p>State Representative Nicole Collier, a Democrat from Fort Worth, reported being confined within the Texas Capitol after returning with fellow Democrats who had left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort. Collier stated she was locked in because she refused to sign a permission slip for a mandatory escort by the Department of Public Safety. This measure was intended to ensure the returning Democrats' presence for an upcoming special session on the controversial new congressional maps. The political standoff highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting, which could add five more Republican-leaning seats ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>Many residents in Nevada, including military veterans and seniors on fixed incomes, are facing increased food insecurity due to rising grocery prices and significant changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Southern Nevada's primary food bank, Three Square, reports that one in seven residents is food insecure, with child hunger rising to 22% in the region.

          <p>A second airman from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with a fatal shooting, marking the second such case in a month. Airman First Class Jadan Orr, 20, allegedly shot and killed a 23-year-old man in a Cheyenne apartment while handling an AK-47 rifle after a night of drinking. This incident follows the arrest of another airman in July for the shooting death of a fellow service member, a case which prompted the Air Force Global Strike Command to suspend the use of the Sig Sauer M18 handgun.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called 'designer Xanax.' This action follows a request from Kentucky's attorney general, who is also leading a coalition of 21 states urging the DEA to classify the drug as a Schedule 1 controlled substance at the federal level. The unregulated drug, which is often disguised as prescription medication, has been linked to a growing number of overdose deaths, with nearly 50 fatalities in Kentucky alone last year. The ban empowers law enforcement to immediately begin making arrests for its sale or possession.</p>

          <p>California's Democratic lawmakers have initiated a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move they describe as a necessary countermeasure to Republican efforts in Texas to gain more seats in Congress. If the legislation passes, a ballot measure will go to voters in a special November election to approve new maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. Democratic leaders argue this is essential to protect democracy from President Trump's agenda, while Republicans accuse them of a partisan power grab that subverts the will of voters who established an independent redistricting commission. The proposal is expected to face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A meeting between an American Orthodox archbishop and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska has drawn sharp condemnation from Ukrainian Orthodox bishops in the U.S., who labeled it a 'betrayal of Christian witness.' Archbishop Alexei of the Orthodox Church in America met with Putin, exchanging warm greetings and holy icons, and expressed gratitude for Russia bringing the Orthodox faith to Alaska. Critics argue the meeting legitimizes Putin, who faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes. The Ukrainian bishops stated that extending admiration to Putin amounts to an endorsement of his regime's actions and the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to 'lead a movement' to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines, planning to sign an executive order to bar states from using them. During a White House meeting, he claimed, without evidence, that these methods are corrupt and unreliable. However, legal experts immediately countered that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to regulate federal elections. Experts note that any such executive order would face immediate legal challenges and that the president lacks the power to unilaterally dictate how states conduct their elections, a right deliberately reserved for the states.</p>

          <p>A report from a mental health facility in Kabul reveals the dire situation for Afghan women with mental illnesses, many of whom are effectively trapped within the system. Strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions make it nearly impossible for women to live independently, meaning even those ready for discharge cannot leave if their male relatives refuse to take them back. The center is overcrowded and struggling to cope with rising demand, reflecting a broader mental health crisis among women in Afghanistan. The UN links this crisis to the severe restrictions on women's rights since the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>One week into the Trump administration's federal takeover of Washington, D.C., the deployment of National Guard troops from multiple states is escalating, raising concerns about the mission's objective and duration. While the stated goal is to combat crime, the article notes that federal officers are not concentrated in the highest-crime areas and that the military presence has unsettled many residents. With no clear emergency or defined endpoint, there is growing apprehension that the takeover could extend indefinitely or serve as a model for federal intervention in other Democrat-run cities, testing the legal limits of presidential power over domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest accrued on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed by disasters. Previously, lenders could deposit insurance funds into an escrow account and keep the interest earned while homeowners waited for the funds to be released for rebuilding. The new legislation, which now awaits the governor's signature, mandates that homeowners will be guaranteed at least 2% interest on these funds. This move aims to close a loophole and provide additional financial support to residents recovering from catastrophic events like wildfires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season was marked by a significant refereeing controversy during the Leeds vs. Everton match. Leeds secured a 1-0 victory thanks to a penalty awarded after a shot struck the arm of Everton's James Tarkowski, who argued his arm was in a natural position by his side. According to football law, a handball occurs if a player makes their body 'unnaturally bigger,' but the interpretation of this rule remains a point of contention. Pundits and managers were divided on the decision, highlighting the ongoing confusion and debate surrounding the handball rule in modern football.</p>

Peiris noted the increasing frequency of animal viruses jumping to humans in recent decades, citing examples like swine flu, MERS, and Ebola.

By leaving, they broke the legislature's quorum, temporarily halting a vote on new voting maps aimed at increasing the Republican majority in the U.S. House. Now back, they plan to fight the maps in court, arguing they are discriminatory. Their return allows the legislature to proceed, and Governor Greg Abbott has already called another special session where the controversial maps are expected to be approved, escalating the national partisan battle over gerrymandering.</p>
