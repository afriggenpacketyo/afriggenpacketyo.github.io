          <p>Elon Musk has announced that Tesla aims to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco shortly after. The service will begin with approximately ten Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised software, and will rapidly scale to thousands if the initial launch is successful and incident-free. Musk has been promising self-driving capabilities since 2016, and this launch is a crucial step in realizing that long-awaited vision for Tesla. The company intends to proceed cautiously, starting with a small fleet to ensure safety and reliability before a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>A diverse group, including the Trump administration, environmental groups, and men's rights influencers, is advocating for restrictions on the weedkiller atrazine, citing its links to cancer, birth defects, and low sperm counts. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is highlighting the harms of pesticides like atrazine in a forthcoming report from the ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again‚Äù commission. The effort faces opposition from the agricultural and chemicals lobby, which has historically resisted stricter regulations, even as the Trump administration rolls back restrictions on various industries. Concerns over reproductive health and the potential for an uneasy alliance across political lines underscore the growing debate over pesticide regulation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to construct a missile defense shield system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," aimed at protecting the United States from missile threats. The project, reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, could potentially cost tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars. The plan involves integrating the new system with existing defense capabilities, with the goal of intercepting missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space. Critics have questioned the necessity and cost of such a system, while military officials have cited existing missile defense systems already in use.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering a new approach to COVID-19 vaccines, prioritizing immunizations for high-risk individuals while requiring additional studies for children and healthy adults. This shift could mean annual boosters are not automatically recommended for everyone, instead focusing on older individuals and those with health risks.

          <p>Economists are divided over the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with mainstream economists arguing that companies will inevitably pass along the costs to consumers. However, populist thinkers on both the left and right suggest that companies may have more pricing power than traditionally believed and could absorb some of the costs. The debate centers on whether companies are exploiting concerns about inflation to manipulate prices, rather than simply responding to increased costs. While some argue that companies should use their profits to cushion consumers, others maintain that companies will prioritize preserving profits, regardless of size.</p>

Still, who was born in Belgium to English parents, announced his departure from Lens to return to the UK.

          <p>This article explores the impact of debt forgiveness on credit scores, noting that while it can provide a path to becoming debt-free, it generally does hurt your credit. Settling a debt is typically marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full," which can negatively affect your credit score. The damage is not permanent, however, and the impact lessens over time, especially if you rebuild your credit with responsible financial behavior. The article also discusses when debt forgiveness may be worth the credit damage, particularly for those facing bankruptcy or wage garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some newspapers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, have published a syndicated summer book list that includes made-up books by famous authors. The list was part of licensed content provided by King Features and partly generated by Artificial Intelligence. Only five of the 15 titles on the list are real. The incident has sparked outrage among writers and readers, raising concerns about the quality and accuracy of content in media. The article also notes the impact of defunding libraries and the lack of full-time book reviewers in the industry.</p>
