          <p>Honda Motor reported a significant 76% drop in operating profit for the fourth quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations, with a 12.2% decrease for the full fiscal year. The company attributes the decline to falling automobile sales in China and Southeast Asia, although hybrid electric vehicle sales in North America showed growth due to incentives. Facing potential tariffs from the U.S., Honda has downgraded financial projections for the current fiscal year, anticipating a further decrease in operating profit. The company plans to carefully assess the impact of tariff policies and implement recovery measures to improve profitability.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The bill requires two doctors to assess a patient's mental fitness before allowing them to seek medical assistance to end their life. Supporters argue this is a progressive step to alleviate suffering, while opponents express concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals. The vote is expected to be close, with the Scottish government remaining neutral on the matter.</p>

          <p>This week's inflation report will provide initial insights into the impact of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs on U.S. prices. Economists anticipate a slight cooldown in inflation, despite initial fears of price hikes due to the tariffs, although many analysts expect a resurgence in inflation as retailers restock inventory with tariffed goods. The article notes that Trump has since paused some tariffs, including those on China, which is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

          <p>Fintech firms, which initially benefited from rising interest rates, now face a test as rates decline, raising doubts about the sustainability of relying on net interest income. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo saw profit boosts in 2024 due to higher net interest income, but lower rates may expose vulnerabilities in their business models. Some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams through services like crypto trading and subscriptions to reduce reliance on interest and card fees. ClearBank's shift from interest income to fee-based income highlights the potential impact of lower rates.</p>

The visit aims to strengthen relationships between the two countries, focusing on trade, cultural, and defense links. This marks the first state visit to the UK by a French president since Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008.</p>

          <p>The family of detained former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is claiming a landslide victory in local elections, despite Duterte's arrest by the International Criminal Court. Preliminary results indicate Duterte was elected as mayor in his home city, with several family-backed candidates also leading in Senate races. The results boost Vice President Sara Duterte, the former president's daughter, ahead of her impeachment trial in July. The family's continued influence highlights the complex political landscape in the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a trade agreement, leading to a 90-day pause with reduced tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the agreement creates a mechanism to avoid escalation and that the U.S. does not want a general decoupling of the two countries' economies. The agreement includes slashing levies on 'de minimis' shipments and China removing a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing jets. Despite initial optimism, economists note that average tariffs remain significantly higher than before the trade turmoil began.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of continued weakening, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling. Job vacancies have also declined, and wage growth has slowed, although pay is still rising faster than inflation. Analysts suggest that recent increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage may be affecting recruitment. The Bank of England is likely to remain cautious about future interest rate cuts due to persistent wage growth.</p>
