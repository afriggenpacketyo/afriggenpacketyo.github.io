          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has been elected as Germany's chancellor in a second-round parliamentary vote after initially failing to secure the necessary support. Merz received 325 votes, surpassing the required 316 out of 630 members of parliament. The German Dax stock market index pared losses following the announcement of the second vote's results. The CDU is expected to form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic Party, outlining plans for policies including migration, tax rule changes, and social security measures.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing major delays and cancellations due to air traffic control staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions at the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility. The FAA has implemented a "flow constrained area" to manage traffic, and some controllers are on trauma leave following a radar and communication outage. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy visited the Philadelphia TRACON facility, and a plan to revamp the air traffic control system is expected. Runway construction is also contributing to the congestion, with United Airlines canceling 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as "confirmed right-wing extremist," intensifying debates over a potential ban of the party. This classification has already led to consequences, including the exclusion of AfD politicians from official trips. CDU leader Friedrich Merz stated that it is now inconceivable to elect AfD members to committee chairperson positions. The AfD has filed a lawsuit against the intelligence agency, claiming the classification is unlawful and politically motivated, though the agency's assessment is based on court rulings providing evidence of the party's radicalism.</p>

          <p>The Constitution mandates that all non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded "due process of law," but the specifics of this process are contested. While President Trump insists it cannot mean "a million or 2 million or 3 million trials," legal experts agree that migrants do not have extensive procedural protections from removal. The Supreme Court has ruled that detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, but the type of notice and hearing depends on individual circumstances. The administration revealed it provides detainees a one-page form in English, allowing them a short period to challenge their detention, a timeline the ACLU deems unreasonable.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed to a trade deal after three years of negotiations, aiming to facilitate UK exports of whisky, cars, and other products to India, while cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The deal does not include changes to immigration policy, including for Indian students in the UK. The British government hails the benefits for UK businesses and consumers as "massive". Once in force, UK consumers are likely to benefit from reduced tariffs on Indian goods, while UK firms can expand exports to India. Gin and whisky tariffs will be halved, with further reductions in later years.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a significant drop of over 10% despite the company's ongoing revenue growth acceleration. Analysts cited concerns regarding modest full-year revenue guidance, a sequential margin decline, and a year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue as contributing factors. William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma noted that the company's high software multiple makes it vulnerable to compression as revenue growth slows. Despite the stock's decline, Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and raised its revenue guidance for the year.</p>

          <p>A high school student in North Texas is on life support after sustaining a severe head injury while playing the "Senior Assassin" game. Isaac Leal, 17, was standing on the back of a Jeep that was making several turns when he was ejected onto the pavement. The family is seeking a criminal investigation, claiming it was not an accident, and is having trouble moving Isaac to another hospital. The school had issued a warning about the game, and other schools are threatening suspensions for students caught playing it on campus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. exports are experiencing a widespread slump due to President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, with the agricultural sector and top farm products like soybeans, corn, and beef being particularly affected. Trade data indicates declines at major ports, including Los Angeles, Savannah, and Norfolk. The decrease in exports is linked to a decline in containerships coming to the U.S., as businesses cancel manufacturing orders, as well as changes in global demand linked to U.S. trade policy. Retailers are urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as supply disruptions may be looming.</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are expressing significant anger and frustration following the party's poor performance in local elections, focusing on issues such as the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance and welfare reforms. Despite a categorical denial of any wiggle room on winter fuel, there is debate over the government's welfare reforms and changes in eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip). A UK-EU summit on May 19 is seen as an opportunity to strengthen European ties, which could boost progressive support, while an upcoming immigration white paper is viewed as a potentially tricky moment for Labour's coalition.</p>

          <p>The Haenyeo divers of Jeju Island, South Korea, have evolved unique genetic adaptations due to their generations-long cultural practice of deep-sea diving. Genomic analysis reveals distinctive traits, including bradycardia (slow heart rate) and genetic mutations associated with cold tolerance and decreased diastolic blood pressure. These adaptations may protect pregnant women while diving and could potentially lead to new medical therapies for conditions like stroke. The study highlights how humans can evolve genetic adaptations in response to long-standing marine-based cultural practices.</p>

These artists, included on Hitler's list of "divinely gifted" individuals, benefited from National Socialism and often faced limited consequences during denazification. Many received well-paid commissions in public spaces after 1945, despite their past associations with the Nazi party.

Now, congressional Republicans are considering curtailing or ending them as one way to achieve the steep federal spending reductions proposed in the House budget. If they did, it would save the federal government about $600 billion over the next decade. The change could hit some Republican-led states the hardest, a recent analysis shows, because their Medicaid budgets tend to be more reliant on the medical provider tax strategy.</p>
