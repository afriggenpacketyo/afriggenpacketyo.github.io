          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with Scottish First Minister John Swinney to discuss key issues, including tariffs on Scotch whisky and the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The conversation, which took place at Trump's Balmedie Estate, also touched on North Sea oil and gas taxation, with Swinney advocating for the industry which he believes is overtaxed. Swinney emphasized the unique importance of Scotch whisky to Scotland's economy, appealing to Trump for an exemption from the 10% U.S. tariff. The leaders also exchanged views on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with Swinney urging the president to use his influence to push for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk plunged by 23% after the company announced a new CEO and significantly lowered its full-year financial guidance. The maker of the popular obesity drug Wegovy cited weaker growth expectations in the U.S. market due to competition from compounded drugs and a slower-than-anticipated market expansion. The company appointed veteran Maziar Mike Doustdar as its new CEO, effective August 7. This news compounds existing market concerns following disappointing trial results for its next-generation obesity drug candidate, contributing to a share price drop of over 42% this year.

          <h2>Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern Announce Proposed Merger to Form First U.S. Transcontinental Railroad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 11:40:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-line transcontinental railroad in the United States. The companies argue the merger would streamline national shipping by eliminating handoff delays, potentially benefiting consumers with faster and more reliable deliveries. However, the proposal faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to concerns about reduced competition and the potential for a monopoly. If approved, the deal could pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue their own merger to remain competitive in the freight market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, attributing the improvement in part to the softening of some U.S. tariffs on imported goods. The projection was also boosted by a surge in U.S. imports as companies moved to preempt higher taxes. The IMF now predicts global growth of 3.0% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, though this remains below pre-pandemic averages. Despite the modest improvement, the organization warned that persistent trade tensions and uncertainty could still lead to weaker economic activity and that U.S. inflation may remain above target.

          <p>Spotify's stock price dropped more than 11% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations and provided a weak forecast for the upcoming quarter.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase, the largest credit card issuer in the U.S., is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. This move would mark Goldman's exit from a high-profile but challenging venture into consumer credit cards, which incurred significant costs and regulatory scrutiny. For Apple, partnering with an established issuer like JPMorgan could bring more stability to its financial product offerings. The potential deal would further solidify JPMorgan's dominance in the credit card market while allowing Goldman Sachs to refocus on its core businesses, moving past a difficult chapter for its consumer banking ambitions.</p>

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry has strongly condemned the Trump administration's plan to impose a 15% tariff on medicines imported from the European Union. The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries (EFPIA) called the tariff a "blunt instrument" that will disrupt supply chains, hinder research investment, and ultimately harm patient access to necessary drugs. This move breaches a long-standing World Trade Organization agreement that keeps medicines duty-free. The White House text indicated the tariff is part of a broader strategy to establish what it calls balanced trade, but it has created confusion and concern among European trade partners and industries.

          <p>Shares of internet infrastructure company VeriSign fell more than 7% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold nearly one-third of its stake for $1.23 billion. Berkshire, which had been VeriSign's largest shareholder, sold 4.3 million shares, reducing its ownership from 14.2% to 9.6%. VeriSign stated the sale was intended to bring Berkshire's stake below the 10% threshold, which carries additional regulatory obligations. Berkshire began investing in the company in 2012, and the sale comes after VeriSign's stock had risen more than six-fold during the investment period, locking in a significant profit for Buffett's firm.

          <p>A new analysis from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth indicates that President Trump's proposed tariffs could increase costs for U.S. factories by 2% to 4.5%. This potential cost surge could squeeze manufacturers that rely on global supply chains, possibly leading to wage stagnation or even layoffs, particularly in swing states with large manufacturing sectors. The report highlights the economic challenges of Trump's trade policy, which aims to revive domestic industry but may inadvertently harm it by raising the price of imported materials and components. The White House maintains that the tariffs will ultimately benefit American businesses by opening new markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a record number of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) set to mature this year, savers face a key decision about where to place their funds. Experts advise against passively allowing CDs to auto-renew, as current interest rates are lower than last year and may fall further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Instead, savers should proactively compare options during their bank's grace period. Alternatives include shopping for a new CD with a better rate, moving funds to a more liquid high-yield savings account, or considering other investment vehicles depending on their financial goals and need for access to the money.

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from Catalhoyuk, a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey, provides strong evidence that the society was organized around women. Researchers analyzed DNA from individuals buried under the same houses and found they were often related through their mothers, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This finding supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The study also revealed that grave goods were far more abundant with female bodies than male ones, further suggesting women held an elevated status in this ancient community.</p>

          <p>India is now home to over 3,600 wild tigers, representing about 75% of the global population, according to a recent census. While these numbers mark a conservation success, experts warn that significant risks remain. The primary threat is habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects, which isolates tiger populations and affects their movement and breeding. Conservationists argue that focusing solely on population size is insufficient and that protecting the quality and connectivity of their habitats is crucial for the long-term survival of the species. Human-wildlife conflict and poaching also continue to pose challenges in certain regions.</p>

The article suggests that instead of promoting false positivity or discouraging requests for help, parents should foster emotional resilience by acknowledging difficult feelings.

          <p>According to Juliet Schor, a lead researcher on global four-day workweek trials, companies that successfully transition to a 32-hour week without pay cuts employ three key strategies. First, they reduce the number and length of meetings, replacing many with written updates and protecting focused work time. Second, they empower employees to re-engineer their own work processes for greater efficiency, particularly in non-office environments like manufacturing. Finally, they eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects, freeing up time for more strategic activities. These changes have consistently led to higher profits, less turnover, and improved employee well-being.</p>
