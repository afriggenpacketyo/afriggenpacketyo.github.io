          <p>Bitcoin has rebounded, surpassing $90,000 for the first time since March, driven by investors seeking refuge from a weakening dollar and volatile stock market conditions. The cryptocurrency experienced a significant two-day gain, fueled by increased inflows into U.S. ETFs tracking spot Bitcoin prices. This surge occurred amidst President Trump's intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, adding to the market's instability. Analysts note Bitcoin's recent decoupling from traditional risk assets, indicating resilience despite light trading volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's persistent criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has sparked concerns about his potential removal, but economists suggest that even firing Powell might not guarantee the interest rate cuts he desires. Overhauling the entire Fed Board of Governors would likely be necessary to align monetary policy with Trump's preferences, potentially triggering a severe market backlash. Analysts suggest that individual Fed members could resist pressure from a new leader if they perceive Trump as overstepping. The uncertainty surrounding the Fed's future, coupled with ongoing tariff disputes, has negatively impacted investor confidence.</p>

          <p>A Canadian cafe owner praised Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for intervening in a dispute over the sale of Vegemite. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) initially told the owner to remove Vegemite from his shelves due to non-compliance with local standards. Albanese voiced his support for the Australian-made product, leading the CFIA to pause its decision and work towards a longer-term solution for Vegemite sales in Canada. The dispute highlights cultural significance and trade relations.</p>

          <p>Steven Levitsky, a Harvard professor who studies democratic decline, argues that the Trump administration has already inflicted serious damage on American democracy.

Levitsky's assessment raises concerns about the future of American democracy under Trump's leadership.</p>

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. since the start of President Trump's second term, coinciding with the implementation of new tariffs. While not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the primary reason, the White House has promoted these moves as supporting job creation on home soil. Companies such as Apple, Chobani, and Johnson & Johnson are committing significant investments to expand their U.S. manufacturing footprint. Economists remain skeptical that tariffs alone are sufficient to drive such strategic shifts, citing other factors like labor costs and regulations.</p>
