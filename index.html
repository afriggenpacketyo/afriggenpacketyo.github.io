          <p>England fast bowler Jamie Overton will miss the remaining one-day internationals against the West Indies after breaking his little finger. The injury occurred while Overton attempted to take a return catch during the series opener. He initially left the field for treatment but returned to bowl, taking three wickets before the severity of the injury was fully assessed. Matthew Potts has been named as Overton's replacement in the England XI, and Overton is expected to be sidelined for approximately a month, also missing the T20 series against the West Indies.</p>

He defends his reporting as truthful, directly refuting Rubio's assertion that it is a lie.

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is entering hurricane season with significant staffing gaps due to budget cuts initiated by the Trump administration. Meteorologists are concerned that these shortages could compromise the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts, potentially endangering communities. The cuts have resulted in the loss of personnel at the National Hurricane Center and local forecast offices. With an above-normal hurricane season predicted, former Weather Service directors have warned of potential loss of life if resources are not replenished; the agency is attempting to redistribute staff to mitigate the impact of the shortages.</p>

The flooding was exacerbated by the collapse of a nearby dam, and Nigeria's Meteorological Agency has warned of further flash floods in several states.

          <p>President Trump has sparked controversy by pardoning convicted drug dealers, including Larry Hoover, who led the Gangster Disciples, despite advocating for escalating the U.S. drug war and harsher penalties for dealers. Trump has granted clemency to at least eight individuals convicted on federal drug charges during the early months of his second term. Critics highlight the mixed messages, questioning the consistency between threatening tougher penalties and releasing drug dealers from prison. A White House spokesman said the administration expects Illinois officials to follow the federal government's lead by freeing Hoover. </p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has sparked debate about whether the U.S. might follow suit. While some see it as a potential solution to Social Security's funding challenges, experts caution that it may not be suitable for the U.S. due to income and life expectancy disparities. The U.S. already has legislation in place to gradually raise the full retirement age for Social Security from 65 to 67. Experts suggest that an across-the-board increase in the retirement age would disproportionately harm those in lower income brackets who already receive benefits for a shorter period of time.

          <p>California lawmakers are challenging Governor Newsom and CalRecycle over proposed regulations to implement Senate Bill 54, aimed at curbing plastic waste. The lawmakers argue that the draft regulations undermine the intent of the legislation by potentially approving polluting recycling technologies and providing broad exemptions for products under USDA and FDA purview. They claim these exemptions allow producers to unilaterally determine which products are subject to the law, increasing program costs. The lawmakers' letter, signed by 23 legislators, calls for revisions to ensure the regulations align with the statute's goals. The new draft regulations are the result of Newsom's concerns about the law potentially increasing costs to California households.</p>

Many caregivers, like Josephine Biclar, fear deportation under the Trump administration's policies, which could worsen the existing labor shortage in long-term care. The article notes that while most care workers are citizens, employers are increasingly asking for work authorization documents, and some workers are self-deporting due to the hostile environment.

Governor Newsom has allocated over $200 million to revamp San Quentin, making it the most visible example of the California Model. The model includes changes in how inmates and guards interact and what rehabilitation opportunities are available.</p>

          <p>LZ Granderson reflects on the marriage of retired NBA player Jason Collins and the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights, noting that marriage equality remains fragile despite being the law of the land for nearly a decade. Granderson highlights the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ bills across the country and the need to remember that marriage is a hard-won right. He references Carl Jung's assertion that the pendulum of the mind oscillates between sense and nonsense, not right and wrong, emphasizing the absurdity of having one's humanity used for political theater. The article emphasizes that while support for same-sex marriage has grown, it continues to be under assault.</p>

          <p>Gregory P. Magarian, a law professor, argues that the Trump administration is suppressing free speech through indirect methods, such as conditioning government benefits on institutions altering their advocacy, intimidating speakers into silence, and molding government speech to promote official ideology. He notes that the administration has withdrawn security clearances, canceled contracts, and barred access to government buildings for law firms opposing its policies. Universities have also faced pressure to change their speech through withholding funding for those embracing DEI or tolerating antisemitism. Magarian contends that these actions, while not direct censorship, undermine free speech by leveraging official power to make it less free.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings after nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons yielded false positives between April and July of last year. Inmates who were denied parole based on these faulty tests may be entitled to a new hearing. Attorneys for inmates affected by the defective drug tests confirmed the false test results after they received records showing that positive test results had spiked across the stateâ€™s prison system. The review involves at least 459 parole hearings, as well as dozens of administrative reviews and denials from inmates to move up their parole hearings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that the UN's global population estimates may be significantly undercounted, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions, due to incomplete census data in rural areas of the global south. While this news may raise concerns about overpopulation, the author argues that anxieties about population size often reflect power struggles over resource distribution and which lives are valued. Historically, fears about overpopulation have led to coercive policies, but the current approach focuses on empowering women through education and access to reproductive healthcare, which has proven effective in reducing fertility rates. The author suggests that responsible consumption and sustainable technologies can mitigate the challenges of a larger population.</p>

This shift is intended to streamline decision-making and accelerate product development, but it raises concerns about the potential for AI to overlook or misjudge risks related to user privacy, harm to minors, and the spread of misinformation. Former Meta employees worry that this automation will lead to less rigorous scrutiny and increase the likelihood of unforeseen repercussions. Meta maintains that human expertise will still be used for novel and complex issues, but insiders express skepticism about the potential for engineers to adequately assess risks.</p>

Critics argue that these agreements lack a genuine meeting of the minds and may violate federal bribery statutes.

The government is set to release a strategic defence review outlining its priorities for military and security spending. The review assumes the 3% target and warns of a new era of threats, including drones and artificial intelligence. It recommends deploying digital experts alongside troops to protect against enemy drones and control future unmanned weapons. While the government's budget watchdog estimates the additional cost at Â£17.3 billion in 2029-30, Healey expresses confidence in meeting the target.</p>
