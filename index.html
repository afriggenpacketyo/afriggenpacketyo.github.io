          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt in parts of Georgia and North Carolina. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, with the USGS receiving over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness for residents in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, which experiences occasional tremors. The article notes that seismic waves travel more efficiently in the Eastern U.S. due to the region's geology.</p>

          <p>At least seven people have died in Mogadishu, Somalia, after heavy rains overwhelmed the city's drainage system, leading to widespread flooding.

Rescue efforts are underway, but the death toll may rise as some residents remain trapped in waist-high waters.

          <p>Charles Barkley has voiced strong criticism of the NCAA's management of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals and the transfer portal, calling the organization a "bunch of idiots and fools." Barkley expressed concerns about the large sums of money being paid to college athletes and the frequency with which players can transfer schools. While not opposed to players getting paid, he questions the return on investment for these large NIL deals, especially given the short tenure of some players. Barkley stated he prefers to donate to HBCUs and rebuild houses in his hometown, rather than contribute to what he considers a "cesspool" of college athletics.</p>

          <p>Personal finance expert Ric Edelman is urging for increased financial literacy in America, particularly among young investors. He believes the current generation is drawn to get-rich-quick schemes and overly complex financial products, exacerbated by a lack of mandatory personal finance education in high schools. Edelman cautions against relying on social media for financial advice and advocates for simpler, more transparent financial products. He highlights the motivation of younger generations to achieve financial success as a reason for optimism.</p>
