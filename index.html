          <p>This political analysis argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strategically prolonged the war in Gaza to maintain his grip on power and avoid potential jail time from his corruption trial. The article suggests the new U.S.-brokered peace plan, which he initially resisted, has become a political lifeline that could benefit him regardless of its ultimate success. By accepting the deal, he can campaign as a peacemaker who brought hostages home, or if it fails, he can blame Hamas and continue the military conflict that keeps his government intact.</p>

          <p>A recent offhand comment by a New Jersey gubernatorial candidate, who called the state's beloved pork roll "gross," has reignited a long-standing cultural debate within the Garden State. The controversy centers on the regional naming dispute over the processed pork product, known as pork roll in the south of the state and Taylor ham in the north. The article explores the history of the breakfast meat, its importance to New Jersey's identity, and how it is typically prepared and served on an egg and cheese sandwich.</p>

This move is part of a federal push to develop domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The decision reverses a previous administration's rejection of the controversial Ambler Road project, which opponents argue will harm the environment and local communities.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly asked students not to participate in pro-Palestinian protests planned for the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack. Citing a concerning rise in antisemitism on British streets, Starmer described holding protests on the anniversary as disrespectful and an excuse for some to direct hatred towards British Jews. His call comes as the UK implements heightened security measures to protect its Jewish communities following a recent deadly attack on a synagogue in Manchester.</p>

          <p>Two designers who work for Universal Studios and Walt Disney Imagineering have launched an independent, interactive theatrical production in Los Angeles called "People in the Dark." The show aims to combine the high-quality art direction of theme parks with the intimacy of immersive theater, leading small groups of seven guests through a ghost tour that explores themes of old Hollywood exploitation. The creators, Jackson Mancuso and Josiah Evaristo, see the project as an opportunity to create tactile, actor-driven experiences that large-scale parks cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Raoul Peck's new documentary, "Orwell: 2+2=5," is being described as a terrifyingly current examination of authoritarianism, created entirely from the words of writer George Orwell. The film, which received a powerful reception at the Cannes Film Festival, features actor Damian Lewis narrating Orwell's writings from works like "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and personal diaries. This narration is set against a barrage of modern imagery, including drone warfare, refugee crises, and AI-generated content, to illustrate how Orwell's warnings about power and propaganda are playing out today.</p>

In exchange, Pfizer receives a valuable three-year exemption from tariffs the administration had threatened, suggesting the deal is more beneficial to the company's bottom line.</p>
