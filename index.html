            <p>A personal trainer from County Durham, Mazyar Azarbonyad, admitted to dangerous driving after a high-speed chase with police resulted in a crash injuring seven officers. The incident occurred after police noticed a defective rear light on his BMW, leading to a pursuit where Azarbonyad sped away and drove without insurance or a license. The crash involved five police vehicles and another car, with an unmarked police Volvo hitting Azarbonyad's car at approximately 80mph. Azarbonyad, who came to the UK from Iran, has been granted conditional bail and is due to be sentenced next month, showing remorse for his actions.</p>

According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has considered using surrogates to reach "legion-level before the apocalypse." He has also allegedly solicited women on X to bear his children. The article critiques the gendered double standards surrounding Musk's actions, contrasting the positive portrayal of him as an eccentric genius with how a woman acting similarly would be judged.</p>

This involves drawing attention one way while the real action happens elsewhere, such as hyping tariffs while focusing on China and reviving American manufacturing. Another example is using tariff revenue as a bargaining chip for a new tax plan. He also frames his foreign policy decisions as striving for peace through strength, aiming to keep America out of wars. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has condemned the new US port fees targeting vessels owned, operated, or built by Chinese firms, calling them discriminatory and protectionist. The ministry vowed to retaliate against the measures, which it says harm Chinese companies and disrupt global supply chains. The US administration finalized port fees on Chinese vessels docking in the United States as part of efforts to buoy the domestic shipbuilding industry and curb Chinese dominance in the sector. Chinese operators will have to pay increasing fees per net ton for vessels entering US ports.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>According to experts, early reading proficiency is a strong predictor of long-term success, and there are several ways parents can encourage literacy in their children. These strategies include treating baby babble as conversation, asking questions and waiting for answers, focusing on letter sounds rather than just names, engaging in word play, and seizing everyday opportunities for reading. Research suggests that responsive interactions in a child's first two years boost preschool literacy skills, while asking questions helps build stronger vocabularies. Parents who emphasize letter sounds help their children grasp the connection between speech and written words.</p>

            <p>A recent analysis reveals that $2 million in retirement savings, combined with Social Security payments, can last from 23 years in Hawaii to 72 years in West Virginia. This significant difference is primarily due to variations in the cost of living, particularly housing prices, across different states. The analysis considered typical retiree expenses, such as groceries, housing, transportation, utilities, and healthcare, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and adjusted for each state's cost-of-living index. While $2 million is a substantial amount, it covers more than 35 years of retirement in all but three states.</p>

            <p>With climate change worsening seasonal allergies, doctors offer tips for managing symptoms, including keeping the outside outside by removing shoes and clothes upon entering the house, showering before bed, and keeping windows closed. They also recommend wiping down pets, using masks, and rinsing the nose with a neti pot or saline spray. Understanding different allergy medications and using nasal sprays correctly, by aiming towards the ear rather than snorting, can also provide relief. Awareness of factors that worsen allergic reactions, such as alcohol and exercise, is also crucial.</p>
