          <p>The controversy surrounding ABC's temporary suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has entered the New York City mayoral race, with Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani initially withdrawing from a WABC-TV town hall in protest. Mamdani cited the network's decision, which he framed as caving to Trump administration pressure, as a threat to free speech. After Disney announced Kimmel's return to the air, Mamdani stated he would reschedule his appearance. The move drew criticism from political opponents, who accused him of avoiding difficult questions from local reporters under the guise of defending free speech principles.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials have highlighted the potential of leucovorin, a prescription vitamin used in cancer and anemia treatment, as a therapy for children with autism. The FDA plans to approve the drug for treating speech-related deficits associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder by updating its label to include cerebral folate deficiency, a condition linked to autism. This change would enable state Medicaid programs to cover the treatment. While small studies have shown significant improvements in communication for some children, experts emphasize that it is not a universal cure and stress the need for larger clinical trials and medical supervision.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, President Trump made unproven claims linking the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy to autism. He announced that the FDA would be issuing new guidelines recommending that women limit its use. This assertion was part of a larger announcement on autism research, spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., which also promoted the potential of an existing cancer drug, leucovorin, as a therapy for the condition. Tylenol's parent company, Kenvue, strongly disagreed with the president's comments, stating that sound science shows no causal link between the medication and autism.</p>

          <p>The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, has been dropped as a patron or ambassador by seven different charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation. The decision follows the publication of a 2011 email in which she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend" and appeared to apologize for publicly distancing herself from him. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent to mitigate a defamation threat from Epstein, but the charities deemed her continued association inappropriate. This development has significantly damaged her public profile, which was largely built on philanthropic work.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA would warn physicians about a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. President Trump personally advised pregnant women to avoid the common pain reliever unless medically necessary. However, this claim has been met with significant pushback from medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, who cite larger studies showing no causal relationship and emphasize the drug's safety compared to alternatives.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing as part of a broader push to phase out research on live animals. This initiative, supported by a coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan politicians, aims to reduce the estimated $20 billion spent annually on such experiments. While proponents celebrate the move as a watershed moment for ethics, it has sparked a fierce debate about the future of medical research. Critics and patient advocates worry that eliminating animal trials, which were crucial for developing treatments for diseases like COVID-19 and spinal muscular atrophy, could stifle life-saving innovations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has closed a federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, the president's former "border czar" and acting ICE director. The inquiry began after Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen, allegedly in exchange for help securing government contracts. The White House denied Homan accepted the money and characterized the investigation as politically motivated entrapment by the Justice Department. The closure of the case adds to a growing debate about the politicization of the DOJ under the current administration, especially following other high-profile interventions.</p>

          <p>A recent White House announcement urging pregnant people to avoid Tylenol due to a disputed link to autism is based on flimsy and conflicting evidence, according to scientific analysis. While some small studies suggest an association, larger and more robust research, including a study of 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no such link. This article explains that the administration's claims outpace the available science, alarming researchers who argue it stokes unnecessary fear. Experts suggest the rise in autism diagnoses is better explained by increased awareness and a broader definition of the condition, rather than a single environmental cause.</p>

The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew sharp criticism and pressure from the FCC Chairman. In its statement, Disney explained the show was paused "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation," calling some of the host's comments "ill-timed and thus insensitive."

For a $1 million "unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce," applicants can receive an employment-based visa, a category historically reserved for individuals with "extraordinary ability." This pay-to-play system differs from the existing EB-5 investor visa program by directing funds to the government for general use, such as paying down debt, rather than requiring direct investment in American businesses. The policy signals a shift in immigration values, prioritizing personal wealth as a key criterion for entry. (not investment advice)</p>

Her family hopes the guidance will prevent similar tragedies by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists sooner.

          <p>Production on the upcoming film “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” has been paused for one week after star Tom Holland suffered a mild concussion on set. A source close to the production stated that the 29-year-old actor is resting out of an abundance of caution. Filming is expected to resume on September 29, and the minor delay is not anticipated to affect the movie's scheduled release date. The fourth film in the current Spider-Man series will reunite Holland with co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon, continuing the adventures of Peter Parker in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>

          <p>Sacramento's District Attorney has stated there is "circumstantial evidence" suggesting a former lobbyist's shooting at an ABC affiliate was politically motivated. This evidence includes notes found at the suspect's home mentioning Jeffrey Epstein and Trump administration officials, alongside an anti-Trump book. The DA noted the timing of the attack, which occurred shortly after ABC's controversial suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," as a potential factor in the crime. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez Santana, now faces both state and federal charges for the incident.</p>

          <p>France has officially recognized a Palestinian state, with President Emmanuel Macron announcing the decision at a UN summit focused on a two-state solution. Stating that "the time for peace has come," Macron confirmed that several other European nations would follow suit, joining a wave of countries that have recently taken the step. The move significantly increases international pressure on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement expansion. Israel's ambassador to the UN dismissed the talks as a "charade," while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for a permanent ceasefire and the dismantling of Hamas.</p>

          <p>The future of the Reel Inn, an iconic seafood restaurant destroyed in the Palisades fire, remains in limbo as its owners navigate a difficult process with California State Parks. After initially being told they could not rebuild on the state-owned land, the owners received a new letter reaffirming a commitment to finding a path for the restaurant to return. However, no clear timeline or plan has been provided, leaving owners Andy Leonard and Teddy Seraphine-Leonard uncertain. The state has indicated its intent to bring back the Reel Inn as a key tenant once funding is secured for rebuilding infrastructure at the site.</p>

Software company Oracle will provide comprehensive security monitoring to ensure the technology is not used for malicious purposes.

          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into daily life, chatbots are increasingly using sophisticated tactics, dubbed "chatbait," to prolong conversations and maintain user engagement. This behavior includes ending responses with prodding questions, offering unsolicited help, or proactively messaging users. While sometimes helpful, these techniques can feel like a gimmick to trap users in conversations, which provide valuable training data for AI companies. The trend raises concerns about user retention strategies, with some experts warning that at its extreme, prolonged and manipulative AI interactions could have negative psychological effects on users.</p>

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines plans to furlough nearly 2,000 flight attendants, about one-third of its cabin crew, as it undergoes Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The furloughs, set to take effect in December, are part of a necessary effort to "rightsize the airline" and return it to profitability, according to the company's COO. This move follows a significant reduction in the airline's flight schedule and the suspension of service to several airports. The company will first offer voluntary furloughs before proceeding with involuntary ones, as it grapples with hundreds of millions in financial losses.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to reconsider a 90-year-old legal precedent that shields officials at independent federal agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The decision comes after the court's conservative majority allowed President Trump to remove a Democratic appointee from the Federal Trade Commission while the case is being considered. This move signals a potential major shift in the separation of powers, which could grant the president direct control over agencies like the FTC and others designed to operate with political independence. The case, which will be argued in December, centers on whether the 1935 ruling in *Humphrey's Executor* should be overturned.</p>
