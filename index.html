        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a Utah man on death row for 37 years, are arguing that his severe dementia prevents him from understanding his impending execution, potentially violating constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. The defense presented evidence that Menzies, now 67, struggles with basic tasks like medication management and laundry, while prosecutors maintain he retains sufficient mental capacity. The judge will decide within 60 days whether Menzies is competent to be executed, a decision that could impact the possibility of him being executed by firing squad, a method he previously chose. Matt Hunsaker, whose mother was murdered by Menzies, expressed the emotional turmoil the ongoing case has caused his family.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has once again publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a 'fool' after the central bank decided to hold steady interest rates, citing economic uncertainties related to tariffs. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates in order to stimulate the economy, but the Fed remains cautious due to potential inflationary pressures from the tariffs. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook for employment and price stability, disregarding political pressures. Trump's attacks on Powell have previously unsettled markets, raising concerns about the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in kids’ lives, driven by demographic shifts, longer life expectancy, and the increasing need for child care support. Spending more time with grandparents is linked to better educational and mental health outcomes for children. Grandparents are increasingly stepping in to fill gaps in America's child care system, a role they are not always excited about filling. Experts suggest policymakers should embrace reforms that allow grandparents to spend time with their grandkids because they want to, not because their families have no other choice.</p>

Economist Martha Gimbel projects that tariffs could increase household expenses by approximately $5,000 per year, disproportionately affecting lower-income families.

          <p>New York City's financial watchdog is warning that the Trump administration's cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will create an 'open season' for scammers and predatory lenders. Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, is calling on state and local governments to compensate for the reduced federal oversight. The CFPB has recovered billions for consumers in the past, and its weakening could leave borrowers vulnerable to unfair practices. Borrowers with student loans have been especially vulnerable to unfair practices.</p>

          <p>Economists say that even though the overall market is strong, it can be tough for jobseekers to find a new gig. Unemployment was relatively low in April, at 4.2%, and job growth exceeded expectations, but businesses are hiring at their slowest pace since 2014. Experts suggest job seekers get creative with networking, look for internal opportunities, customize applications, and upskill or reskill. The article notes the growing divide in the labor market between those out of work and those who are employed.</p>

          <p>While Trump's plan to place Elon Musk in charge of a new Department of Government Efficiency was initially dismissed as a joke, it has since become a real force in government. However, as an effort to meaningfully reduce federal spending, DOGE remains wholly unserious. The project seems quite likely to expand long-term budget deficits. Slashing IRS enforcement will embolden tax evasion and reduce revenues by hundreds of billions of dollars over the decade.</p>
