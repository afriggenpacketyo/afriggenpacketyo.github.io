          <p>The Senegalese women's basketball team had their US training camp cancelled after several members were denied US visas, leading Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko to instruct the Ministry of Sports to move the training to Dakar. The team was preparing for the 2025 Women's AfroBasket tournament in Ivory Coast, and the visa refusals have raised concerns, especially given reports of potential travel restrictions on Senegal. The US State Department declined to comment on specific visa cases, citing confidentiality laws, while Nigeria's Foreign Minister warned that expanded travel bans could hinder energy and mineral deals with West African countries. The Trump administration has maintained that national security and visa overstay rates are key concerns. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles, potentially undermining a key tool for curbing planet-heating emissions. The court sided with oil and gas companies and Republican-led states, who argued that California's waiver to set tougher standards caused financial harm. The ruling overturns a lower court's decision that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing. Environmentalists and California's leadership have defended the waiver, emphasizing its role in driving vehicle innovation and reducing greenhouse gases, as transportation is a major source of pollution. </p>

Trenton Abston was apprehended with a TASER, gloves, rope, and duct tape after being seen on security footage scaling the wall to the mayor's neighborhood. The arrest occurred after Young defended the city against criticism from sports analyst Stephen A. Smith, who cited safety concerns as a deterrent for NBA players.

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with initial rides in Model Y vehicles within a geofenced area, though access is by invitation only.

The company plans to start with a small number of vehicles and gradually scale up the service, with launches in Los Angeles and San Francisco to follow. The success of this rollout is crucial for Tesla to deliver on its promises in the autonomous vehicle market. </p>

While some locals recognize the need for traffic improvements, others find the size of the box junction "ridiculous" and hope it may become a tourist attraction.

The album reflects lead singer Danielle's split from her longtime producer, Ariel Rechtshaid, marking both a personal and artistic unchaining. Musically, "I Quit" is characterized by its surge and excess, blending various genres and styles with instinctual and playful arrangements. The lyrics explore post-breakup grief, anger, and horniness, capturing the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle. </p>

Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to prioritize measures that keep society safe from gun violence, such as universal background checks and safe-storage regulations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Invasive insects like the Asian tiger mosquito and the Asian hornet are increasingly prevalent across Europe due to climate change and global trade, posing significant threats to native plants, animals, and human health. These pests compete with native species, destabilize ecosystems, spread diseases, and destroy crops, costing the EU billions annually. Efforts to manage these invasive species include trapping, nest removal, and biological control methods, such as using the Samurai wasp to combat the brown marmorated stink bug. The European Environment Agency emphasizes the need for ongoing vigilance and mitigation strategies to minimize the damage caused by invasive insects. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump "likely acted within his authority" in federalizing the California National Guard amid protests over immigration raids, indefinitely blocking a lower court order that would have returned control of the guard to the governor. The court cited acts of violence during the protests as justification for the federalization, stating that Trump had a basis for his decision. The ruling allows the Trump administration to maintain control of the guard as the case continues through the courts. The judges also said that Governor Newsom had no power to veto or countermand the Presidentâ€™s order. </p>

          <p>The "One Big Beautiful Bill" proposed by Republicans could significantly impact low-income children and families by scaling back key social safety net programs.

Proposed changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and tax credits could create administrative hurdles and reduce access to essential services.
