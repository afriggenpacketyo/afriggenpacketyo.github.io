          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the age-related aspects of buying annuities as a retirement planning tool, noting that while there are no federal age limits, individual insurers often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85. It explains that the timing of a purchase significantly affects costs and returns, with different age ranges offering distinct advantages. The piece suggests that the best age depends on an individual's retirement strategy, health, and financial goals rather than a specific number, advising a balance between higher payouts for older buyers and the risk of reduced product availability.

          <p>Prosecutors have started their closing arguments in the high-profile national security trial of 77-year-old pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong. Lai, who founded the now-shuttered Apple Daily tabloid, has pleaded not guilty to charges of colluding with foreign forces and sedition, which could result in a life sentence. The prosecution is focusing on his international connections, including meetings with U.S. officials, as evidence of advocating for sanctions against China. The trial is being closely watched internationally as a key indicator of press freedom and judicial independence in the city.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has expressed a sudden concern for protecting bald and golden eagles from wind turbines, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directing the enforcement of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Critics suggest this move is less about conservation and more about obstructing the development of wind energy, a frequent target of President Trump's criticism. The article points out that far greater threats to birds include cats, buildings, and climate change—the latter being a problem wind energy helps mitigate. It also notes the irony that the administration is simultaneously weakening other wildlife protection laws.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, ending a two-week standoff and restoring the quorum needed for legislative business, which allows Republicans to proceed with a controversial mid-decade redistricting plan. This Republican-led effort aims to create up to five new GOP-favorable congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In response, Democrats in other states, notably California, are advancing their own redistricting proposals to counteract the potential Republican gains. The developments highlight a growing national battle over partisan gerrymandering outside of the typical decennial census cycle.</p>

          <p>Shares of Meta Platforms declined following a report that the company is restructuring its AI team for the fourth time in six months, raising concerns about its strategy despite heavy investment in AI talent. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's stock remained stable after its competitor, Novo Nordisk, reduced the cash price of its diabetes drug Ozempic. The market's muted reaction is attributed to the fact that the price cut targets the less significant cash-pay market for diabetes treatments, as most patients have insurance coverage, unlike obesity medications where direct-to-consumer platforms are more crucial.

          <p>Gateway Church, one of the largest megachurches in the U.S., has officially installed Daniel Floyd as its new lead pastor, marking a significant transition for the congregation. The change in leadership comes 14 months after founding pastor Robert Morris stepped down following accusations of child sexual abuse, for which he now faces criminal charges in Oklahoma. In his first sermon, Pastor Floyd acknowledged the weight of the moment and promised to lead with integrity, aiming to begin a "new story" for the church. The institution is still navigating legal challenges, including a defamation lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The US Open mixed doubles tournament has been revamped this year, featuring a condensed schedule, a $1 million prize for the winners, and a star-studded lineup of top singles players like Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, and Carlos Alcaraz. This new format aims to generate more fan interest but has drawn criticism from doubles specialists, many of whom were unable to enter because entry was based on singles rankings. While some players express excitement for the high-profile matchups, others, including members of the WTA player council, have questioned the USTA's lack of consultation in making such a significant change.</p>

          <p>The £40 million transfer of academy graduate Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa to Newcastle has sparked frustration among fans of both clubs, who see it as a consequence of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Because the sale of a homegrown player counts as pure profit, it provides a crucial accounting benefit for clubs needing to balance their books, even if it means losing a beloved player. The article explains how these financial regulations can incentivize such sales, creating a difficult situation for ambitious clubs trying to compete with the established top teams.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open found that nearly a third of people using the new over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, had previously used no method of contraception. The research, based on a survey of nearly 1,000 users, also showed a significant shift from less-effective methods like condoms. The findings suggest that removing the prescription requirement is successfully reducing barriers to access, particularly for younger, uninsured, and rural individuals. The most common reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

          <p>The recent trend of frequent job-hopping, known as the "great resignation," has been replaced by "job hugging," where workers are clinging to their current positions amid a cooling labor market. The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest level in years, reflecting decreased confidence in finding new employment. This stagnation is linked to a slower hiring rate and reduced job openings, making workers more risk-averse. While providing stability, experts warn that staying put could lead to slower wage growth and skill stagnation for employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a two-stage framework that includes an initial 60-day truce in exchange for the release of about half of the remaining Israeli hostages, followed by negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated a preference for a deal that releases all hostages at once. The development comes amid intense Israeli military operations in Gaza and growing domestic pressure in Israel.</p>
