            <p>The U.S. Naval Academy canceled a planned speech by podcaster Ryan Holiday, citing concerns over political content aimed at young naval officers. Holiday, known for speaking on stoicism, planned to discuss the "pursuit of wisdom" but included a reference to the academy's removal of books from its library. The Navy stated its decision was a "schedule change" to maintain an apolitical environment. The book removals followed President Trump's order to eliminate "un-American, divisive" theories, leading to the removal of books like Maya Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order preventing the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants without due process. The order came after the ACLU claimed the government was attempting to defy a previous Supreme Court ruling requiring notice and an opportunity to challenge removal. The Court's action suggests a potential shift in its tolerance of procedural tactics used to evade judicial review. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order, highlighting the division within the court.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point, driven by discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become increasingly negative. The public also disapproves of Trump's handling of inflation and federal government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's efforts to expand coal mining while simultaneously cutting funding for agencies that protect miner health and safety have drawn criticism. The cuts, overseen by Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk's unofficial "department of government efficiency," affect agencies responsible for preventing occupational hazards like black lung. Critics argue that these actions undermine miner safety and health, particularly as cases of black lung are increasing among younger miners. The administration's decision to pause a new rule on silica dust also raises concerns.</p>
