          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are meeting in Scotland to negotiate a trade agreement. The meeting comes just before an August 1 deadline, after which the U.S. has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on all EU goods. While Trump has stated there is a "50-50 chance" of reaching a deal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the deadline is firm with no extensions. European negotiators are reportedly seeking a baseline tariff of around 15 percent, similar to the deal secured by Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" debuted with an estimated $118 million in domestic ticket sales, marking a significant success for the studio. The film's strong opening, coupled with a global haul of $218 million, suggests a potential rebound for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has seen inconsistent box office performance and critical reception since "Avengers: Endgame." With an 88% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the film's quality is seen as a key factor in its success, reinforcing the idea that audiences will respond to well-made superhero movies despite claims of genre fatigue.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man is in custody after a stabbing attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, left eleven people wounded. The incident, which police described as random, occurred near the store's checkout area. Citizens reportedly assisted in apprehending the suspect and providing aid to the victims before first responders arrived. The injured are being treated at a local medical center, with four in serious condition and seven in fair condition, though the hospital noted "encouraging signs of recovery." The FBI is assisting the Grand Traverse County Sheriff's Office with the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured his sixth victory of the season at a wet-dry Belgian Grand Prix, extending his championship lead. The Australian driver made a decisive move to overtake his teammate Lando Norris on the first racing lap after a lengthy rain delay. Piastri then expertly managed his medium-compound tires to finish the race without an additional pit stop, a strategy that initially seemed risky. The win places him 16 points clear in the championship, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished third, holding off Red Bull's Max Verstappen.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch announced that her party would legislate to ban all NHS doctors from striking if they win the next election. The proposal would place doctors under similar restrictions to those on police and military personnel, requiring minimum service levels during industrial action. The announcement comes as resident doctors began a five-day strike over pay, which the British Medical Association (BMA) says has declined by a fifth in real terms since 2008. The BMA condemned the proposal as a "desperate intervention" and an attack on the fundamental rights of workers in a modern democracy.</p>

While some see it as a one-off financial decision, others view it as a signal of a broader decline due to shifting viewer habits and rising production costs. The article notes that while Colbert's show consistently won its time slot in ratings, it also operated at a significant annual loss.

The senators are questioning a $30 million U.S. pledge to the GHF and are calling for a return to funding established UN-led aid mechanisms.

          <p>According to a BBC analysis, Israel's announcement of a "tactical pause" in Gaza is likely a gesture to appease international allies who have strongly condemned the growing starvation crisis. The article suggests the measures, including aid airdrops and humanitarian corridors, are insufficient to address the catastrophe and are viewed skeptically by aid organizations. Critics point out that the new aid distribution system, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), is considered inhumane and militarized, with over 1,000 Palestinians reportedly killed trying to access its sites. The analysis concludes that only a full ceasefire and an unrestricted, long-term aid operation can truly alleviate the suffering.</p>

          <p>White House OMB Director Russell Vought criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for being "too late" on both raising and lowering interest rates, suggesting the president seeks a successor more attuned to the market. Vought defended the administration's temporary withholding of education and health funds, citing a need for programmatic review to prevent waste and misuse. He confirmed the administration is always considering rescission packages to claw back funds appropriated by Congress, stating that all options are on the table to prevent a large omnibus spending bill and ensure fiscal discipline, while denying they are laying the groundwork for a government shutdown.

          <p>An investigation reveals that new mothers are having their lives disrupted and families threatened due to false positive drug tests administered in hospitals. Common substances like poppy seeds on a bagel can trigger a positive result for opiates, leading to immediate child welfare investigations in many states. The article highlights cases where mothers were forced into restrictive "safety plans" and temporarily separated from their newborns, even when confirmatory tests later proved their innocence. Critics and medical groups argue that a single, often unreliable, urine test should not be used as a basis for such drastic actions.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three areas of Gaza to allow aid agencies to distribute food and medicine amid a severe hunger crisis. The move, which applies to Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, follows intense international pressure and warnings of famine. While the UN's food agency welcomed the step, it reiterated that a full ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need. The Hamas-run Health Ministry reported additional deaths from malnutrition, highlighting the urgency of the humanitarian situation as aid convoys begin to move.</p>

          <p>A financial advice column analyzes the new "Trump IRA," a savings account for children under 18 established in a recent bill. The account allows for up to $5,000 in annual contributions and includes a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born in a specific timeframe. While acknowledging the free money is a benefit, the author argues that other savings vehicles like 529 education accounts, Roth IRAs, and whole life insurance policies offer more significant long-term advantages. The article suggests these alternatives provide greater tax benefits, flexibility, and growth potential for parents looking to save for their children's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Research on the four-day workweek indicates that the resulting boost in employee happiness comes not just from more free time, but also from feeling more effective at work. Lead researcher Juliet Schor notes that when faced with a condensed schedule, workers and teams are motivated to streamline processes and eliminate busywork, leading to a sense of accomplishment. This increased productivity and feeling of being "on top of their work" has a significant positive impact on overall well-being. The shift also fosters better team spirit, as colleagues collaborate to achieve the shared goal of a shorter week.</p>
