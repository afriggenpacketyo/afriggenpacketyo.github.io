          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marked the two-year anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, describing it as a "fateful war for our existence" and asserting that Israel's enemies have not broken the nation. He expressed profound sorrow for the victims and pledged unwavering commitment to recovering all hostages, both living and deceased. Netanyahu outlined three primary war objectives: the unconditional return of all captives, the complete eradication of Hamas's control in Gaza, and establishing a permanent guarantee that the territory will never again pose a threat to Israel. He stressed the critical importance of national unity to achieve these ambitious goals, particularly as indirect negotiations with Hamas continue in Egypt over a proposed peace plan.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 plummeted to their lowest annual level since 1970, with U.S. Border Patrol recording approximately 238,000 apprehensions. This significant reduction is largely attributed to the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, which included sealing and militarizing the southern border and effectively closing the American asylum system using emergency powers. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson celebrated this as a clear fulfillment of President Trump's promise to secure the border, highlighting increased national safety from unvetted individuals and dangerous drugs. While some analysts note a prior decline under the Biden administration's asylum limits, the Trump administration's stringent policies are widely seen as having established a "new normal" for migration flows.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on a Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors. Counselor Kaley Chiles, a Christian, argues the law unconstitutionally restricts her free speech in discussions with young patients who wish to explore reducing unwanted sexual attractions or aligning their identity with their physical body. Colorado, however, contends the law primarily regulates professional conduct, aiming to protect minors from unsafe and ineffective treatments, not speech itself. Several justices, including Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito, expressed skepticism about Colorado's interpretation, raising concerns about potential viewpoint discrimination. The case highlights a complex legal conflict between individual free speech rights and a state's authority to regulate medical practices for patient protection, with a significant decision anticipated by early July.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, a leading expert on generative AI, asserts that "no one knows anything" definitively about AI's future impact on jobs and the economy, including top AI research labs. He highlights the current lack of experienced gen AI workers and the evolving nature of the technology, rendering past training methods quickly obsolete. Mollick emphasizes a necessary cultural shift in the workplace, moving from rewarding "having answers" to valuing "asking brilliant questions" and rapid decision-making. He advises leaders to personally engage with AI tools for at least 10 hours weekly to understand its capabilities and limitations, fostering organic innovation rather than relying on restrictive task forces.</p>

This updated positive outlook for the region comes after a summer characterized by significant global economic uncertainty, largely driven by U.S. tariff policies. Specifically, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 remained largely unchanged, while Australia's ASX/S&P 200 experienced a slight decline, and futures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng index indicated an increase. With mainland China and South Korean markets closed for holidays, attention also turns to upcoming policy decisions from the Bank of Thailand and Reserve Bank of New Zealand, as global investors continue to navigate a complex and evolving economic landscape.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The system, currently located over 1,300 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, is projected to steadily strengthen and likely evolve into a hurricane within the next day or so. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several Caribbean islands, including Barbuda, Anguilla, and St. Kitts. Although Jerry is not currently expected to make direct landfall, forecasters warn that the storm will generate significant swells, leading to life-threatening surf and rip currents. Additionally, the Leeward Islands face the risk of flash flooding from up to four inches of rain, necessitating caution for residents in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Scott Gaffner, a soybean farmer in Illinois and a Trump supporter, is experiencing significant financial strain due to China's boycott of American soybeans amidst the ongoing U.S. trade war. China, historically the largest consumer of U.S. soybeans, has made no purchases this harvest season, leaving farmers anxious and their crops in silos. While the Trump administration considers a $10 billion financial aid package for affected farmers, Gaffner emphasizes that farmers desire "trade, not aid," fearing long-term loss of market share if China establishes new trade routes elsewhere. This situation highlights the economic impact of trade policies on rural American communities and future generations of farmers.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. airports, including Denver, Newark, and Burbank, experienced significant flight delays on Monday due to a critical shortage of air traffic controllers, a situation exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Federal data indicates that more air traffic control facilities are now flagged for low staffing levels than at any point since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom led to soaring delays. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association warned that the aviation system is "fragile" and urgently called for accelerated training and hiring to address this vulnerability. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed a "slight tick up in sick calls" among essential workers, who are mandated to work without pay during the shutdown, further straining an already precarious system and underscoring the need for a resolution.</p>

Maher, celebrated for her empowering social media presence, emphasized how sports can give bodies a purpose beyond their appearance, fostering a sense of capability.

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to drastically increase tariffs on imported steel, a move that the UK steel industry warns could trigger its "biggest crisis." The EU aims to halve the amount of steel that can be imported tariff-free, beyond which a 50% tariff will apply. This decision, driven by pressure from member states struggling with cheap imports, particularly from China, directly impacts the UK, as the EU is its most crucial export market for steel. UK Steel director general Gareth Stace urged the government to secure country-specific quotas to avert potential disaster, while Industry Minister Chris McDonald pledged to protect trade flows and explore stronger measures against unfair practices.</p>

Walker's confirmation was part of a larger "en bloc" vote, a procedural change implemented by Senate Republicans to approve numerous executive branch nominees with a simple majority, bypassing individual votes.

This collaboration is considered "incremental" to Nvidia's existing work with other AI firms and is focused on establishing OpenAI's own robust AI infrastructure for long-term operational independence, further solidifying Nvidia's pivotal role in the rapidly expanding AI industry.</p>

          <p>An analysis warns of a brewing civil-military crisis in the U.S., asserting that President Donald Trump and his allies are making rapid progress in seizing control of intelligence agencies and the justice system, with the military as the last remaining institution outside his grip. The article highlights Trump's efforts to politicize the armed forces, deploying troops to American cities and issuing potentially illegal orders, such as unilateral strikes against "narco-terrorists." It posits that senior military commanders may soon face a critical choice between obeying the president and upholding the Constitution and the law. The author, a former Naval War College professor, expresses deep trepidation over the unprecedented challenge to American civil-military relations.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is delaying the swearing-in of Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva, a new House Democrat, stating it will not occur until her party agrees to end the ongoing government shutdown. This decision represents an extraordinary power play, effectively denying a duly elected member her seat, despite Johnson's earlier public statement that he would swear her in "as soon as she wants." While the Speaker's office claims it's customary to swear in members during legislative sessions, Johnson previously swore in Republican representatives during pro forma sessions earlier this year. Grijalva's swearing-in is particularly crucial as she is expected to provide the final signature needed on a petition to force a full House vote on releasing further materials in the Jeffrey Epstein case, leading to accusations of a potential cover-up.</p>

          <p>UFC star Conor McGregor has been handed an 18-month suspension for violating the UFC’s anti-doping policy, specifically for missing three attempted biological sample collections within a 12-month period in 2024. Combat Sports Anti-Doping (CSAD) announced the ban, which is backdated to September 20, 2024, and runs through to March 20, 2026. CSAD noted that McGregor was recovering from an injury and not in fight preparation during the missed collections, and that he fully cooperated with the inquiry, accepted responsibility, and supplied information explaining the circumstances. These mitigating factors led to a reduction from the standard 24-month penalty for three whereabouts failures. McGregor, who last competed in July 2021, has since re-entered the UFC testing pool and provided four samples in 2025, but his planned bout for UFC 303 in 2024 was cancelled due to injury.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell acknowledged that while the current demand for computing power is "tremendous," the production of artificial intelligence data centers will eventually reach a saturation point.

The company's AI servers, powered by Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra chips, are sold to major clients like CoreWeave and xAI. Dell also highlighted that power availability remains a critical constraint for customers, with OpenAI and Nvidia's planned 10-gigawatt data center buildout alone accounting for a substantial portion of the U.S. power grid's expected additions in 2025.

          <p>The Department of Justice has assigned two assistant U.S. attorneys from North Carolina to the case against former FBI Director James Comey, ahead of his arraignment in Virginia. This development follows Comey's indictment last month by a grand jury, after President Donald Trump ousted the former U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, who reportedly had expressed internal doubts about bringing the case. Lindsey Halligan, Trump's handpicked replacement to lead the office despite having no prior prosecutorial experience, personally presented evidence to the grand jury and has reportedly struggled to gain internal support for the prosecution. Comey faces charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 Senate testimony on the FBI's Russia investigation, a case that highlights concerns about the politicization of justice within the department.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration officials detained Bayron Rovidio Marin for 37 days in a hospital, at times shackled to his bed, without ever formally charging him. This followed an encounter with agents at a Carson car wash where he sustained serious leg injuries. U.S. District Judge Cynthia Valenzuela issued a temporary restraining order, sharply criticizing ICE for failing to provide any proof that Marin had "violated any law or regulation" or was a "flight risk," and for severely restricting his access to counsel, medical providers, and family. Marin's lawyers contend his indefinite detention without charges represents a clear constitutional violation, especially given he was held under a pseudonym and constantly monitored by guards. This case raises serious concerns about due process, civil liberties, and the actions of federal immigration authorities.</p>

Imelda Avila-Thomas, a Department of Labor employee, described the situation as a "double whammy" for her household, planning a garage sale and suspending her daughter's tutoring due to the loss of income. While furloughed workers typically receive full backpay after the government reopens, President Donald Trump hinted at denying such compensation for some, adding to the widespread uncertainty and stress. The prolonged impasse is generating "desperation and uncertainty" across federal employee families, with workers urgently urging lawmakers to resolve the shutdown, calling it a "total disaster" that profoundly impacts their livelihoods.</p>

          <p>An analysis investigates whether President Donald Trump's voter coalition is fracturing due to a year of unpopular policies, confrontational tactics, and clashes with perceived enemies. While a majority of his 2024 coalition, particularly his loyal MAGA base, still supports him, there are clear signs of slippage among key groups like Hispanic/Latino Americans and young people. This decline, estimated at a 30 percentage point swing in approval, is primarily attributed to negative perceptions of the economy, including inflation and affordability concerns. These voters, who initially supported Trump to reject the status quo, are now expressing dissatisfaction with him as the incumbent, posing a long-term risk for Republicans.</p>

He specifically urged partners like the Netherlands and Japan to enforce synchronized restrictions, arguing that without such cooperation, existing controls are easily circumvented. The committee's report contends that current restrictions are insufficient, as Chinese entities can effectively cooperate to evade U.S. export controls even without official corporate links.
