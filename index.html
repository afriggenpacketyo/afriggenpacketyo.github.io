          <p>Martin Kettle argues that the UK faces significant economic and political divisions that threaten its stability, and Keir Starmer's Labour government must address these challenges. Starmer's attempt to foster collaboration between the UK government and devolved governments through the Council of the Nations and Regions is a crucial test of modern British governance. The article highlights the historical context of devolution and the need for cooperation to achieve policy goals, emphasizing that without collaboration, no government can effectively address the UK's pressing issues. The author suggests that this council could be key to restoring public confidence in politics.</p>

          <p>An Independent Sentencing Review in the UK has proposed releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence, aiming to alleviate severe prison overcrowding. The review, chaired by former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, advocates for managing more offenders in the community and suggests short custodial sentences should only be used in exceptional cases. The report also calls for increased funding for the Probation Service and greater use of electronic monitoring.

          <p>Richard Poplak discusses the exploitation of the myth of "white genocide" in South Africa by right-wing Afrikaners and their allies in the MAGA movement. The article examines how these lobbyists have successfully amplified their cause by appearing on shows like Tucker Carlson and exploiting the animus towards Black governance. Poplak argues that South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy is widely misunderstood and that the white minority still benefits from the economic legacy of apartheid. The author concludes that right-wing Afrikaners are attempting to rewrite South Africa's history and cast themselves as victims of reverse racism, furthering the global white replacement conspiracy theory.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke California's vehicle emissions waivers, a decision Democrats are calling "the nuclear option," due to the potential impact on states adopting California's standards. The waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than the federal government, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the move is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent.

          <p>The Republican-controlled House is set to vote on President Trump's massive tax and spending bill after overcoming intra-party divisions. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, creates new breaks, ends green-energy subsidies, and increases spending on the military and immigration enforcement. It pays for these changes by tightening eligibility for food and health programs, adding $3.8 trillion to the national debt. This article details the key provisions of the bill and the political challenges it faces.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the complexities of India's trade negotiations with the United States under President Trump, particularly concerning Apple's manufacturing presence. Trump has expressed a desire for Apple to move production to the U.S., complicating India's efforts to attract businesses relocating from China. The article details India's efforts to reduce tariffs and the challenges it faces in competing with China's established supply chain. The author suggests that Trump's stance may be a bargaining tactic rather than a genuine threat to India's relationship with Apple.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed a bill to provide newborns with $1,000 in accounts named after President Trump, called "Trump accounts." Children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested in financial markets. The proceeds could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house, but the accounts function much like typical investment accounts rather than tax-advantaged accounts.
