          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a previous withholding order citing persecution risks. Homan claimed that the facts surrounding the order had changed, alleging Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist affiliated with MS-13, a claim Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny. The Salvadoran president refuses to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., leading to diplomatic tensions and a visit by Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen. A federal judge has paused an order requiring the Trump administration to provide updates on its efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, giving automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. Tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some tariff costs, up to 3.75 percent of a new car's value in the first year, phased out over two years. Automakers have welcomed the changes, stating the leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like GM and allowing them to invest even more in the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party won the federal election, a surprising turnaround influenced by U.S. President Trump's annexation threats and tariffs. The election was largely a referendum on how to deal with Trump, with voters weighing the impact of his policies on Canada's sovereignty and economy. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was cast as having similarities with Mr. Trump that may have ended up costing him votes. Voters expressed concerns about tariffs affecting market prices and emphasized the need for Canada to diversify its global partnerships to avoid over-reliance on the U.S.</p>

Badenoch rejected claims of a rift between her and Jenrick regarding a potential electoral pact with Reform UK, emphasizing her lack of concern for criticism without attribution.</p>

          <p>Walmart and other major U.S. retailers have reportedly instructed some Chinese suppliers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States. This comes after a period of slowed shipments due to tariff hikes between the U.S. and China. A major exporter of stationery and office products in Ningbo received a notification from Walmart to resume normal deliveries, with the U.S. clients bearing the costs of the new import duties.

          <p>As part of President Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, unaccompanied minors are now being targeted for deportation, with the Department of Homeland Security conducting “welfare checks” on children who arrived in the US alone. These actions have sparked fears of a crackdown and prompted alarm about what one critic called “backdoor family separation.” The president has also signed two executive orders related to immigration, including one targeting so-called “sanctuary cities” that “obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws”.

          <p>A 45-year-old Iraqi man, Akeel Abdul Jamiel, was charged with voting illegally in the 2020 presidential election in upstate New York. Jamiel, a non-citizen, is alleged to have registered as a member of the Conservative Party and cast a ballot, with the investigation aided by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Jamiel, who appears to be a Trump supporter, has a history of legal issues, including a prior arrest for first-degree assault. The charge he faces, voting by aliens, is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of as much as $100,000.</p>

          <p>Patrick Vereb, a funeral home director in Pittsburgh, is facing charges for allegedly throwing out the bodies of thousands of pets and providing owners with the ashes of other animals. Vereb is accused of stealing over $650,000 from more than 6,500 customers who paid for pet burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024. Instead of performing the services, Vereb reportedly discarded the pets at a landfill and gave customers ashes from unknown animals.

          <p>As the US-China trade war escalates, China is determined to reduce dependence on the US market and build itself into a large consumer market. Trump's tariffs have further enhanced China’s determination to reduce dependence on the US market and embark on the path of building itself into a large consumer market. In September, Beijing implemented a package of countercyclical policies to fix the problem, seeking to boost domestic demand with a particular focus on consumption. China has a robust toolbox at its disposal for this purpose, including a range of fiscal and monetary policies, with fiscal policy taking the lead.</p>

          <p>President Trump has decided to give automakers a break on some of his tariffs, ensuring that different types of tariffs don't stack up on imports of foreign cars. Importers of foreign auto parts will be able to get some reimbursement from the government for tariffs for the next two years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the move will reward domestic manufacturers while "providing runway" to those needing time to invest in domestic plants. Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imported cars have faced complaints from automakers, though the United Auto Workers has praised the tariffs for potentially bringing more manufacturing jobs back to the United States.</p>
