          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked parts of President Trump's executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives among federal contractors and grant recipients.  The ruling focuses on a certification requirement deemed overly vague and potentially infringing on free speech rights.  A further hearing is scheduled to determine a longer-lasting injunction.</p>
