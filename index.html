        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures driven by weak domestic demand and ongoing trade tensions, particularly with the United States. The consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.1% year-on-year, slightly better than market expectations, while imports also saw a significant drop. Chinese policymakers are urged to implement more forceful and targeted stimulus measures to boost consumption as the country grapples with these economic headwinds. Despite a temporary trade truce with the U.S., exports to the U.S. have plunged, exacerbating the situation. The article suggests that China needs to rely on domestic demand to combat deflation. Optimism score is calculated based on the article's reflection of economic challenges and the need for government intervention.</p>

The vote is considered crucial in determining the next steps, which could include a ballot for strike action.
