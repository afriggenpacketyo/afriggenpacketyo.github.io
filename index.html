          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military offensive to take control of Gaza City, calling it the "best way" to defeat Hamas and free hostages. During a press conference, he also accused the international press of believing Hamas propaganda and dismissed some images of malnourishment as fake. The plan has drawn heavy criticism at the UN Security Council, with nations like the UK and France warning of potential violations of international humanitarian law. UN officials expressed alarm that the operation could trigger another major calamity in the region, causing more death and displacement.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators, led by the UK's chief rabbi, marched through central London to demand the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Protesters carried Israeli flags and placards with hostages' faces, expressing support for Israel and anger at the UK government's conditional plan to recognize a Palestinian state. Some attendees voiced concerns about rising antisemitism in Britain since the conflict began. The Metropolitan Police reported one arrest for assault and a racially aggravated public order offense during the largely peaceful demonstration, which had a significant security presence.</p>

          <p>"Dawson’s Creek" actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, has shared that the primary warning sign he experienced was a subtle change in his bowel movements. The 48-year-old actor admitted he initially dismissed the symptom and was unaware that the recommended screening age had been lowered to 45. Medical experts interviewed for the article confirmed that changes in bowel habits are a key red flag, alongside fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. They stressed the critical importance of early detection through screening, as many colorectal cancers develop silently until they are in advanced stages.</p>

          <p>A new NPR series, "The World, Reordering," examines the significant shifts currently underway in the global geopolitical landscape. The series posits that the "liberal international order" established after World War II, characterized by U.S. leadership and multilateralism, is now fracturing. This change is driven by the resurgence of authoritarian powers and a shift in global alliances, with many countries preparing for a future with diminished U.S. influence. The reporting aims to understand these new dynamics, exploring how countries are forming new partnerships to fill the perceived vacuum and considering what this reordering means for future global stability.</p>

          <p>The political conflict over Texas's redistricting plan has intensified, with Governor Greg Abbott threatening that the fight "could literally last years." Abbott vowed to call continuous special legislative sessions and have Democratic lawmakers arrested upon their return to the state for breaking quorum to block the Republican-led proposal. The plan, reportedly instigated by Donald Trump, aims to create five new GOP-leaning congressional seats, a move Democrats like Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have decried as "cheating." The high-stakes battle reflects national concerns over gerrymandering and its potential to influence control of the U.S. House in upcoming elections.</p>

The policy shift has drawn criticism from within the chancellor's own conservative CDU/CSU bloc, though it is supported by coalition partners and some foreign policy experts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope that Merz would reverse the decision, which marks a significant change in Germany's staunch support for Israel.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing internal turmoil and public scrutiny, exemplified by the case of Sarepta Therapeutics. In 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's expensive gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, despite reviewer concerns over limited data. This decision was initially praised as a sign of the agency's flexibility for patients with few options. However, after three patient deaths were linked to the company's treatments, the FDA requested a suspension of the drug's distribution, causing the company's stock to plummet. This situation highlights the difficult dilemmas the agency faces in balancing rapid access with ensuring patient safety.</p>

He credited Trump's strategy with breaking a deadlock and praised recent moves to increase defense spending and allow U.S. weapons into Ukraine.

          <p>Apple's recent and remarkable 13% weekly stock advance was largely driven by a massive "short squeeze," where investors betting against the stock were forced to buy shares to cover their losses, pushing the price higher. Before the rally, many short-sellers targeted Apple, believing its stock was poised to fall due to a perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial hits from antitrust rulings. However, positive developments, including an apparent exemption from certain tariffs, reversed the stock's trajectory. This squeeze was so powerful it helped lift major market averages, obscuring negative trends elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Expert Argues a Strong Personal Brand is a Crucial Career Tool for Introverts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that developing a personal brand is a key strategy for career advancement, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She defines a personal brand as simply "something in your career that people know you for," which allows you to shape the narrative others have about your skills and talents. Chan advises starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build comfort and momentum. She also emphasizes that offline activities, like hobby groups, can lead to unexpected professional opportunities.</p>

          <p>China conducted a large-scale rehearsal for its upcoming military parade, leading to the closure of central Beijing near Tiananmen Square from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. The parade, scheduled for September 3, will commemorate the 80th anniversary of what China marks as its victory over the Japanese invasion and the end of World War II. The rehearsal involved a "commemorative assembly" and tested the event's complex command operations and logistical support systems. The full parade is set to travel along Changan Avenue, where President Xi Jinping is expected to preside over the event.</p>

          <h2>A New Biography Explores the Theological and Comic Genius of Novelist Muriel Spark</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark" by Frances Wilson, re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic wit obscures her identity as a major modern religious writer. The article suggests Spark's conversion to Roman Catholicism was central to her art, allowing her to explore themes of divine judgment and suffering through a darkly humorous lens. Spark's narrative technique, particularly her use of "auto-spoilers" that reveal a character's fate early on, is presented as a way of playing God with her characters. This forces the reader to focus not on what happens, but on why, mirroring theological questions about providence.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggests her predecessor, Alex Salmond, might have been responsible for leaking details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. While denying she or her government released the information, she described such an act as "classic Alex." Allies of the late Salmond, who was cleared of all charges in 2020, have dismissed the claim as a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy." The journalist who broke the original story also expressed skepticism, stating it was a "conspiracy theory too far." The explosive claim reignites the bitter feud that fractured the leadership of the Scottish independence movement.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he created with Adidas Originals culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans, but the product was reportedly made in China without partnership or credit to the originating communities. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, who stated her government was exploring legal options to support the affected artisans. In his statement, Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in a "meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community," and promotional images have been removed.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has sparked significant concern among U.S. allies, particularly Ukraine. The meeting, intended to fulfill a campaign promise to end the war, is viewed with apprehension that Trump might agree to a deal that legitimizes Russian aggression by ceding Ukrainian territory. This article details the back-channel negotiations led by envoy Steve Witkoff that secured the summit, highlighting Trump's transactional approach to diplomacy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has strongly condemned the possibility of a deal being struck without his country's participation, framing it as a decision against peace itself.</p>
