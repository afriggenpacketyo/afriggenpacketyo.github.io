          <p>Beijing has been struck by deadly floods again, marking the fifth such disaster in northern China since 2012. This year's event is considered unusual because the severe storms primarily impacted the northern areas of the capital, in contrast to the floods of 2016 and 2023 which were concentrated in the south. The article explains that while the rainy season in July and August is typical for the region, the intensity and specific location of this year's flooding highlight a pattern of increasingly severe weather events hitting the city.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is dangerously complacent about the escalating risk of nuclear war, as key arms control treaties like the INF Treaty are dismantled. The author points to Russia's nuclear threats regarding Ukraine and the buildup of nuclear-capable weapons by both NATO and Russia, creating a new and frantic arms race. The piece criticizes the lack of public opposition compared to the Cold War era and warns that nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as offensive tools for winning wars, not just deterrents. The author calls for an urgent halt to this madness to avoid global extinction.</p>

The documentary portrays the 19th-century invasion of Xinjiang by Yaqub Beg, a Central Asian general, as a foreign-backed separatist threat that was rightfully suppressed. This narrative aligns with President Xi Jinping's goal of cementing a singular "community for the Chinese nation."</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry is experiencing a significant downturn after a decade-long boom, with slowing sales and a growing number of distilleries facing financial trouble. The article attributes the decline to several factors, including changing consumer habits, post-pandemic inflation, and the impact of global trade tariffs. An oversupply, resulting from production decisions made during the boom years, is also driving down prices. This "bust" follows a renaissance for the spirit, which had seen its popularity surge due to favorable pricing, nostalgia, and a burgeoning collector's market. (not investment advice)</p>
