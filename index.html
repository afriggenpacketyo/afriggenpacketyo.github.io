          <p>A juror in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial was dismissed due to inconsistencies regarding his stated residence, raising concerns about his candor during jury selection. The judge determined that the juror's statements about living in the Bronx were questionable, leading to his replacement with an alternate juror from Westchester. The trial resumed with testimony from a paralegal detailing messages from Combs' assistant about setting up a "hotel night." Combs has pleaded not guilty and faces a potential life sentence if convicted. Optimism in the judicial process is measured, as the integrity of the jury is crucial for a fair trial.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has launched a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile, priced at $47.45 per month, offering unlimited calls, texts, and data. Coinciding with the 10-year anniversary of Trump's first presidential run announcement, the company plans to introduce a $499 phone manufactured in the U.S. Eric Trump emphasized that this venture aligns with his father's policy to bolster American manufacturing and employment, aiming to disrupt the mobile phone industry. The plan includes free calls to over 100 countries, roadside assistance, and telehealth services, while the phone will feature fingerprint and facial recognition unlocking, 256GB storage, and 12GB RAM.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston extended a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's attempt to block Harvard University's international students from entering the country. The order, now extended until June 23, allows the judge time to consider a longer-term injunction against the proclamation. The Trump administration's June 4 proclamation cited Harvard's engagement with China and other national security concerns as reasons for limiting foreign student entry. Harvard has amended its lawsuit, arguing that the proclamation circumvents the judge's previous decision and violates the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>A review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales, led by Baroness Casey, reveals significant flaws in data collection, making it impossible to assess the true scale of the issue. The report emphasizes a critical data gap regarding the ethnicity of perpetrators, which is often not recorded. While national-level conclusions are difficult, local data from certain police forces indicate a disproportionate number of suspects from Asian ethnic backgrounds in group-based child sexual exploitation. The government has pledged to make ethnicity and nationality data collection mandatory and will commission research into the cultural and social drivers of this issue.</p>

This move aims to monetize WhatsApp's large user base while minimally impacting personal chats. Advertisements will be shown within the status section of the Updates tab, and businesses will be able to pay to promote their channel within that brand feed. The company emphasizes that daily chats will remain encrypted and not used for ad targeting, using limited information like country, language, and channel subscriptions instead.
