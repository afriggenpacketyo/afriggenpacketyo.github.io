          <p>A key inflation measure in the United States indicated a slowdown in price growth during April, even as President Trump's tariffs were implemented. Consumer spending decreased despite rising incomes, suggesting a possible early reaction to higher prices on imported goods. The Commerce Department reported that consumer prices increased by 2.1% year-over-year, a decrease from March's 2.3% and the lowest since September, indicating a continued decline from the post-pandemic inflation spike. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring core prices and is likely to maintain stable interest rates while assessing the impact of tariffs on inflation and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump commended Elon Musk for his work leading the DOGE initiative, aimed at improving government efficiency, as Musk concluded his tenure. Trump praised Musk for bringing "colossal change" to Washington and presented him with a golden key to the White House. Musk, despite facing criticism and challenges, vowed that his departure would not be the end of DOGE's influence. The DOGE initiative faced numerous hurdles, including protests from labor unions and Democrats, and fell short of its initial cost-cutting goals, achieving $175 billion in savings compared to the original $2 trillion target.</p>

          <p>California is contesting its designation as a sanctuary jurisdiction by the Trump administration, arguing that its policies do not obstruct federal immigration law enforcement. Governor Newsom's office has requested the state's removal from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions, asserting that federal court rulings have rejected the administration's argument. The state's sanctuary policies, enacted in 2018, aim to balance preventing local law enforcement from being used for immigration enforcement while still allowing cooperation with federal authorities in certain cases. Homeland Security Secretary Noem has stated that sanctuary communities endanger Americans by protecting criminal illegal aliens.</p>

The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) reports that some of the food, including 200,000 metric tons of flour, is nearing its expiration date. Israel has allegedly limited aid entry to goods from Israel, preventing supplies from Jordan and Egypt from reaching Gaza. Aid organizations are facing significant storage costs for goods valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

The author suggests that heightened awareness of childhood trauma and the redefinition of "harm" have led to impossibly high standards for parenting. This cultural shift, coupled with other factors like financial concerns and career aspirations, may contribute to the growing trend of people choosing not to have children.
