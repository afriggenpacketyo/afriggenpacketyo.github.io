        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Elon Musk's threat to form a new political party in response to a major government spending bill, examining the significant historical challenges third parties face in the American political system. It discusses structural barriers like the "winner-takes-all" electoral process and the immense financial resources required to compete with the Democratic and Republican parties. The analysis also covers the "spoiler effect," where third parties often influence major party platforms by drawing away votes rather than winning elections themselves, suggesting any new movement would need to tap into deep grassroots dissatisfaction to succeed.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that President Trump's tariff policies were the primary reason the central bank did not cut interest rates earlier.

          <p>A key provision within the Senate Republican spending package would permanently increase the maximum child tax credit to $2,200 and subsequently index it to inflation. This article details the proposal, contrasting it with the House version and explaining the current rules, including income-based phase-outs. As part of the broader "big, beautiful bill," this change aims to provide financial relief to families. However, policy experts note that due to the credit's partial refundability structure, the lowest-income families may not be able to access the full benefit from the proposed increase.</p>

          <p>The families of the four murdered University of Idaho students are divided over a potential plea deal for the accused killer, Bryan Kohberger. The agreement would see Kohberger plead guilty in exchange for four consecutive life sentences, allowing him to avoid the death penalty. The father of victim Madison Mogen expressed relief at the prospect of avoiding a painful and lengthy trial. In contrast, the family of Kaylee Goncalves stated they are "beyond furious" with the deal, demanding a full confession and complete accountability rather than a negotiated plea.</p>

          <p>This article outlines several ways homeowners can strategically use their home equity, which has grown significantly due to rising property values. With interest rates on credit cards at record highs, using a lower-rate home equity loan or HELOC is presented as a more affordable borrowing option. The suggestions include consolidating high-interest debt, funding home renovations that increase resale value, and investing in a diversified portfolio. The piece also mentions financing a small business or education, but consistently cautions that these strategies involve risk as the loan is secured by the owner's home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article critically examines the justification behind HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to cut U.S. funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The decision was based on a single 2017 study that claimed the DTP vaccine increased child mortality in Guinea-Bissau. Vaccine experts interviewed by NPR dismantle the study, citing its reliance on 40-year-old data, significant methodological flaws, and the fact that its own authors later published conflicting results. Global health organizations have repeatedly reviewed and dismissed the claims, raising serious concerns about the potential harm of defunding a program credited with saving millions of lives.</p>

The decision halts the termination of approximately 10,000 employees and the restructuring of key agencies like the CDC and FDA, with the judge stating that the executive branch overstepped its authority in attempting such wholesale changes without congressional approval.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and top administration officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, have threatened to prosecute CNN for its reporting. The threats are a response to the network's coverage of an app named "IceBlock," which allows users to track and potentially avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Officials allege that CNN's reporting is illegal and actively encourages interference with law enforcement operations. This action represents a significant escalation in the administration's ongoing conflict with news media organizations and raises serious concerns about freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>The Republican "big, beautiful bill" includes a provision to create a new federal income tax deduction for tipped workers, a key promise from President Trump. This article examines the proposal, noting differences between the House and Senate versions regarding income and deduction caps, and points out that the tax break would be temporary, expiring in 2028. Critics, including policy research centers, argue the measure is an inefficient way to help low-wage workers, as over a third of them already have no federal income tax liability and the benefit excludes many non-tipped employees in similar pay brackets.</p>

          <p>Recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in California's agricultural regions have led to severe labor shortages, causing significant economic damage. Farmers and farm supervisors report that a large percentage of their immigrant workforce, many of whom are undocumented, are no longer showing up for work out of fear of deportation. As a result, valuable fruit and vegetable crops are rotting unharvested in the fields during a peak season. This situation threatens the viability of many farms and could lead to disruptions in the food supply chain and higher prices for consumers.</p>

While these programs can reduce a borrower's total debt by 30% to 50%, they are typically only available to those demonstrating significant financial hardship and can have a lasting negative impact on one's credit score. The piece advises that forgiveness is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It suggests that individuals should first explore all alternative debt relief options, such as nonprofit credit counseling or debt consolidation loans, before committing to a forgiveness plan.
