          <h2>Danish Slave Ships Wreckage Discovered off Costa Rica</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 19:04:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks found off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which were wrecked in 1710. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum confirmed the ships' identities through investigations of ship timbers, cargo bricks, and clay pipes recovered during underwater excavations. The Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, and the Christianus Quintus wrecked in the surf. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but didn't abolish slavery until 1847.</p>

          <p>Jax Ulbrich, the son of Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, has apologized for prank-calling former University of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders during the NFL Draft. Ulbrich impersonated the New Orleans Saints' general manager, falsely telling Sanders he would be drafted by the team. The Falcons released a statement explaining that Ulbrich's son found Sanders' number on an open iPad belonging to his father and the team.

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating is declining as he approaches 100 days in office, with recent polls indicating that a majority of Americans disapprove of his performance. Approval ratings hover between 39% and 45% across three different surveys, marking the lowest approval rating for a newly elected president at this milestone in over seven decades. This decline represents a shift from the initial uptick in favorability ratings Trump experienced upon returning to the White House in January. The polls reflect growing skepticism among Americans regarding Trump's policy decisions and overall handling of the presidency.</p>

          <p>Canada is holding a snap general election after Mark Carney, the new Liberal Party leader, called for a vote shortly after becoming prime minister. The election follows Justin Trudeau's resignation and growing calls for a vote amid trade tensions with the US. Voters will elect members of parliament, with the leader of the party winning the most seats becoming prime minister. The Liberals, Conservatives, New Democrats, and Bloc Quebecois are the main parties contesting the election, with polls indicating a tight race between the Liberals and Conservatives.</p>
