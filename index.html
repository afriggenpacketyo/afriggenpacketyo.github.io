          <p>A powerful storm system brought tornadoes, large hail, and strong winds to the upper Midwest, resulting in three deaths in Enderlin, North Dakota, and widespread damage across the region. The storm, confirmed as a tornado, impacted Cass and Ransom counties, leaving approximately 20,000 customers in North Dakota without power. In Minnesota, Beltrami County experienced wind gusts up to 106 mph at Bemidji Regional Airport, causing flash flooding, downed trees, and extensive property damage, including roofs torn off buildings and numerous gas leaks. Itasca State Park also suffered significant wind damage, leading to closures and the clean-up efforts are complicated by dangerous heat conditions across the Midwest and Northern Plains. The high heat index is expected to reach into the 100s in Minnesota, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, and Iowa, with millions under extreme heat alerts. </p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats proposes offering new army recruits a £10,000 bonus after completing training and serving for two years, along with a £20,000 payment for former armed services personnel who return for two additional years. The proposal aims to increase the number of trained soldiers in response to global uncertainties, including concerns about Russia and the United States. The Liberal Democrats also advocate for a public awareness campaign to prepare British homes for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The plan anticipates raising defense spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by an increase in the Digital Services Tax.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated that Kneecap's scheduled performance at Glastonbury Festival is "not appropriate" after band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh faced a terror offense charge. The charge relates to allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a gig last November, and the Prime Minister's comments followed Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch's call for the BBC not to broadcast the performance. Kneecap responded to the Prime Minister's comments with an expletive-laden accusation of arming a genocide, referring to Israel's actions in Gaza. The BBC, as the festival's broadcast partner, stated that its programming would adhere to editorial guidelines, with decisions made closer to the event.</p>

          <p>A member of Palestine Action has criticized the government's plan to proscribe the group as a terrorist organization, calling it "absurd" and a threat to British democracy. Saeed Taji Farouky, a member of Palestine Action, stated that the government's move is a "knee-jerk reaction" and an attempt to suppress the group's activities. This comes after Palestine Action activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed red paint on two planes, an incident that prompted a security review at military bases across the UK. Amnesty International UK has expressed concern over the use of counter-terrorism powers to target protests.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin, calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrators in Berlin criticized German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comment that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran. Protesters in London waved Palestinian flags and carried signs advocating for an end to arming Israel and opposing war with Iran. The marches reflect ongoing concerns about the conflict and its impact on the region.</p>
