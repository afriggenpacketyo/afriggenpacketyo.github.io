          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios and streaming services, including Netflix, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery, experienced a decline after President Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Trump cited tax incentives offered by foreign countries as a national security threat. The potential tariff raises questions about its implementation, scope, and impact on international relationships, as Hollywood relies heavily on international box office sales. Industry experts worry about potential retaliatory measures from other regions, which could further limit Hollywood's access to global markets.</p>

          <p>Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general, argues that Donald Trump's expansion of presidential power in his second term is not entirely novel but builds upon excesses of previous presidencies. He contends that Trump's use of emergency powers, claims of national security authority, and executive-order programs echo actions taken by presidents such as Nixon, Bush, Obama, and Biden. Goldsmith calls for reforms to limit presidential power and restore Congress's role in policymaking.

This decision has raised concerns about oversupply amid fears of a recession, leading to a decrease in oil prices.
