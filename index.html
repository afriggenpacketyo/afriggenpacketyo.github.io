          <p>A 20-year-old inmate who escaped from a prison near Lyon, France, has been recaptured. The man successfully fled by hiding inside a large bag carried out by his cellmate, who was being officially released. The escape, described by the prison administration as an "extremely rare event," highlighted serious dysfunctions, including an occupancy rate of 170%. An internal investigation was launched to determine how the security breach occurred, with authorities noting the accomplice has not yet been found.</p>

          <p>Chris Kirby, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, transformed his passion for hummus into a highly successful company, Ithaca Hummus. After leaving a burnout-inducing restaurant career, he launched his business at a local farmers market while studying at Cornell University, starting with just a $450 blender. By focusing on a quality product and a slow, deep growth strategy, the brand expanded into over 8,000 retailers nationwide. The company has generated over $150 million in lifetime sales and is projected to earn $50 million in revenue this year.</p>

          <p>Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, with its price subject to constant fluctuation. As of July 11, 2025, the price was noted at $3,357.20 per ounce, though this figure changes continuously. Key factors influencing its value include supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Additionally, interest rates, currency movements, market sentiment, and the policies of central banks play significant roles in determining the precious metal's market price.

          <p>Following learning disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, some experts suggest using 'brain training' programs in schools to improve children's cognitive skills like working memory. A recent German study indicated that such training improved IQ and long-term academic outcomes for young students. However, critics and other large-scale reviews express caution, noting that results from research settings often don't translate to real-world classrooms. Some researchers worry that replacing core subjects like reading with this training could be detrimental, especially for disadvantaged children, and that the overall evidence remains inconclusive.</p>

Meanwhile, smoke from extensive wildfires in Canada has drifted into the U.S., causing unhealthy air quality across the Upper Midwest.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has subtly pushed back against escalating attacks from the Trump administration by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. This move follows accusations from OMB Director Russell Vought of mismanagement and an "ostentatious overhaul," which some see as a pretext to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed's webpage clarifies that costs increased due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes, and refutes claims of new "VIP dining rooms."

This consideration follows criticisms from Donald Trump regarding the significant government financial support Musk's companies have received.

The controversy stems from the use of an autopen to sign the documents, which critics, including Donald Trump, have used to question Biden's mental acuity and the legality of the orders.

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo was compromised by hackers who posted a series of "disgusting" antisemitic messages. The posts, which called for the extermination of Jewish people and attacked President Donald Trump, appeared on the verified page with 650,000 followers. Sesame Workshop, the non-profit behind the show, confirmed an "unknown hacker" gained access and promptly removed the offensive content. The incident has drawn attention to the ongoing issue of hate speech and security on the social media platform.</p>

          <p>A performance by British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival has ignited a major controversy over censorship and political expression. After leading chants of "Death to the IDF" that were broadcast live by the BBC, the band faced a severe backlash, including a police investigation, being dropped by their agent, and having their US visas revoked. Several festivals have since canceled their appearances, prompting other bands to pull out in solidarity. The incident has sparked a broader debate on whether such statements constitute hate speech or are a legitimate form of political protest against events in Gaza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leah Goodridge, a former member of New York City's rent guidelines board, argues that proposals for a citywide rent freeze are not unrealistic and serve as a critical lifeline for many residents. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney, she refutes criticisms that such measures are out of touch, pointing to the four times a freeze was implemented under the de Blasio administration based on data and reports. Goodridge contends that opposition to rent freezes is part of a broader agenda by landlords to weaken rent stabilization laws entirely. She frames the debate as a struggle against a powerful real estate industry prioritizing profits over people.</p>

          <p>An article explores the long and varied history of queerness, challenging the modern binary gender model by highlighting its acceptance in many past societies. It notes that while some historical periods saw draconian punishments for non-normative identities, others, like ancient Greece and Rome, were more accepting of same-sex relationships. The piece discusses notable queer figures from Leonardo da Vinci to Anne Lister, as well as the concept of a "third gender" in various cultures worldwide. It concludes by reflecting on the hard-won freedoms for LGBTQ+ people today and the ongoing need to protect these rights.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting it could be transformed into an employee-owned mutual organization. This proposal comes as the government seeks a "fresh vision" for the state-owned enterprise, which has been plagued by the Horizon IT scandal and a poor commercial track record. The consultation will also examine the number of branches the Post Office should be required to operate and what future services it should offer, particularly banking. Proponents argue that a mutual model could help reform the organization's culture and prevent future scandals.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has imposed a hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people in parts of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Wiltshire, effective July 22. The restriction is a response to a lack of rainfall and increased demand, which have strained water supplies in the region. The ban prohibits using a hosepipe for activities like watering gardens or washing cars, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. This measure follows similar bans by other water companies as the Environment Agency declares a state of prolonged dry weather in large parts of southern England.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement, which advocates for building more housing to increase affordability, is fundamentally a progressive cause rather than a centrist or libertarian one. It reframes the debate by comparing restrictive local zoning laws to a cartel's effort to limit supply and artificially inflate prices for the benefit of existing landowners. The author contends that opposing new housing development is a conservative stance that protects the wealth of a landowning elite. By fighting against this "regulatory capture," the pro-housing abundance movement aligns with populist, anti-monopoly principles aimed at creating a fairer market for everyone.</p>

The tariffs, set to begin August 1, could impact a wide range of European goods and destabilize economies across the bloc. In response, the EU has suspended its own retaliatory tariffs on US goods, hoping to negotiate a deal before the deadline. While some EU leaders advocate for preparing strong countermeasures, the overall sentiment is to pursue a negotiated solution to avoid a full-blown trade war.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has uncovered thousands of instances of abuse involving the use of restraints on inmates in federal prisons. The investigation found that prison officials violated their own policies by shackling prisoners for extended periods, sometimes for days or weeks, and using restraints as a prohibited form of punishment. The report details severe cases, including one death following prolonged restraint and another instance leading to an amputation. The Bureau of Prisons has agreed with the report's recommendations and stated it will revise its policies and practices.</p>
