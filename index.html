            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, can be deported due to alleged threats to foreign policy, a claim initially made by the Trump administration. The judge agreed with Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assertion that Khalil's presence poses an adverse foreign policy consequence, despite Khalil's team presenting evidence against the administration's narrative. Khalil's lawyers plan to file applications for relief to stop his deportation, arguing the ruling violates his right to a fair hearing and weaponizes immigration law to suppress dissent. His wife called the ruling a devastating blow and an attempt to silence those speaking out against the killing of Palestinian families.</p>

            <p>This article delves into the investigation surrounding the murder of Fabio Sementilli, a beauty industry executive, exploring the alleged involvement of his wife, Monica, and her lover, Robert Baker. Evidence suggests Monica was having an affair with Baker, who has since pleaded no contest to the murder and implicated Monica in the crime. The prosecution presented evidence of Monica's actions on the day of the murder, including her alibi and surveillance footage, while the defense argued that the evidence was circumstantial and did not prove her involvement. Baker has since claimed that Monica had no knowledge of his plan to murder her husband.</p>

            <p>Due to high egg prices, families are seeking alternative Easter traditions, with crafters painting rocks and influencers dyeing marshmallows and potatoes. Craft retailers report increased sales of craft egg kits, while major retailers offer plastic eggs and Play-Doh Easter eggs. Some families are opting for reusable foil eggs or focusing on the crafting aspect rather than the consumption of eggs. Paas, a supplier of egg dyeing kits, said that while 94% of those who celebrate Easter will dye eggs this year, 78% of families said they would dye fewer of them than in past years due to the expense.</p>

            <p>Laguna Beach has enacted a new ordinance requiring pickleball players at Lang Park to use quieter paddles due to noise complaints from residents of a nearby senior living facility. The ordinance is a compromise after previous measures like reduced playing hours and a noise-blocking fence. While some residents believe the ordinance is insufficient, pickleball players feel they have made enough concessions and want some playing hours restored. The city is considering moving the pickleball courts further away from the senior living facility in the long term.</p>

The government's reluctance raises concerns about Abrego Garcia's safety, given his past risk of gang targeting in El Salvador, and is seen as part of a larger pattern of attacks on the rule of law.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors and attorneys for the Menendez brothers faced off in court as Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman seeks to reverse a prior recommendation for a lighter sentence. Hochman's team argued that the previous DA's office did not adequately review the case and that the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes. Defense attorneys accused the prosecution of playing politics with the brothers' lives, while supporters of the Menendez brothers say they have shown remorse and are not a risk to society. The ultimate decision on resentencing is pending.</p>

But as part of the crackdown on illegal immigration, legal immigrants are getting caught up in the mix. And then there's people like Amir Makled – a U.S. Citizen and lawyer. Makled was detained by Border agents at a Detroit airport as he returned from a family vacation in the Caribbean.</p>
