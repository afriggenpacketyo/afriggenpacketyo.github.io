          <p>Shares of major European automakers fell significantly after the European Commission announced plans to increase steel tariffs and reduce import quotas. The proposal, intended to protect the EU's domestic steel industry, has sparked alarm among car manufacturers who fear inflationary pressures and higher costs. Industry groups like the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association argue the measures are excessive and are calling for a more balanced approach to protect both steel producers and users.

          <p>Germany's government has revised its economic growth projection for 2025 from zero to 0.2%, anticipating a modest recovery in the latter half of the year. The forecast for 2026 has also been increased to 1.3%, with growth largely attributed to increased state financing for infrastructure and defense. However, critics note this growth is fueled by public debt, while the economy minister acknowledged the need for lower energy prices and tax reforms to stimulate the struggling manufacturing sector.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has called for the jailing of Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor, accusing them of failing to protect federal immigration officers. The statement comes as National Guard troops, deployed by the Trump administration, arrive near Chicago to support mass deportation efforts, despite strong objections and a lawsuit from state and city officials. The officials have condemned the move as an unlawful and dangerous use of military personnel for political purposes.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, pleaded not guilty in a federal court in Virginia to charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation. The indictment stems from his testimony before a Senate panel in September 2020. The prosecution is viewed as a major step in former President Trump's long-standing campaign against Comey, who led the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. A trial date has been tentatively set for early January.</p>

A key component of this strategy is a clandestine barter system with China, where Iranian oil is exchanged for the construction of major infrastructure projects, bypassing the international banking system and providing Iran with crucial revenue.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged period of high prices, U.S. cocoa futures have dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years, losing 10% of their value in a single week. This sharp decline has led investment banks like Citi and Societe Generale to warn that the commodity has become "extremely oversold," with money managers taking on historically large short positions. This situation makes the market vulnerable to a "short squeeze," where a sudden rush to buy back the asset could cause prices to rebound sharply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent polling data suggests a dramatic transformation in U.S. public opinion regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, two years after the October 7 attack. Support for Israel has fallen to historic lows, particularly among Democrats and younger voters, while sympathy for the Palestinian cause has increased. This shift is influencing political discourse, with a growing number of politicians openly criticizing Israel's actions in Gaza, and may signal long-term changes for U.S. foreign policy and the influence of pro-Israel lobby groups.</p>

          <p>A Guardian opinion article argues that the Gaza peace plan drafted by Tony Blair and Donald Trump reflects an imperialistic worldview focused on economic exploitation rather than genuine political solutions. The plan envisions Gaza as a "special economic zone" governed by an unelected board of international business figures, including Blair himself, with an emphasis on creating investable projects. The author contends this approach reduces politics to dealmaking and crude self-interest, continuing a pattern of failed, market-driven interventions in the Middle East.</p>

While the reviewer notes that recent rule changes like the pitch clock have already addressed some of these issues, the book is praised as a celebration of the sport's tradition of debate and storytelling.</p>

White-collar roles in fields like technology and finance, which rely on cognitive skills that AI can replicate, are considered most at risk of disruption. In contrast, jobs requiring physical labor or significant human interaction, such as nursing or construction, are more insulated.

At the party's conference, members and politicians debated strategies to appeal to younger generations, from increasing their presence on platforms like TikTok to implementing youth-focused policies like housing reform. The challenge highlights a growing disconnect, with many young people feeling the economy is geared against them and are therefore drawn to parties promising more radical change.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Animal Welfare Institute indicates that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is increasingly issuing warnings instead of meaningful penalties for violations of the Animal Welfare Act. This trend allows businesses, such as dog breeders and research labs, to avoid fines for severe animal neglect and mismanagement. Critics attribute the weak enforcement to understaffing at the USDA and a chilling effect from a 2024 Supreme Court decision that limited the power of federal agencies to impose civil penalties.</p>

The provision allows for a direct, tax-free transfer of up to $108,000 annually from a traditional IRA to an eligible charity. This method is particularly beneficial because it excludes the donated amount from the retiree's adjusted gross income, which can help lower Medicare premiums and satisfy required minimum distribution obligations without increasing the individual's tax burden.</p>
