          <p>Amazon has terminated Palestinian software engineer Ahmed Shahrour, who was suspended last month for publicly criticizing the company's Project Nimbus contract with the Israeli government. Amazon cited violations of its standards of conduct and acceptable use policy, alleging he misused company resources for non-work-related messages about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Shahrour, however, views his firing as a blatant act of retaliation aimed at silencing Palestinian dissent and protecting Amazon's involvement in what he calls the ongoing genocide in Gaza. This situation underscores a broader trend across the tech industry, where employees are increasingly vocal about their employers' business dealings with the Israeli military, prompting similar actions at companies like Microsoft and Google.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' expectations, though this represented a moderation from the previous quarter's growth. The Ministry of Trade and Industry indicated that manufacturing, particularly in biomedical and general sectors, and construction were the main drags on overall growth. Despite the robust third-quarter performance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has issued a warning that GDP growth is projected to slow in 2026 as trade-related sectors normalize. However, global investment in artificial intelligence, along with ongoing infrastructure spending and favorable financial conditions, is expected to provide support to Singapore's manufacturing and financial services sectors.

The devastating blast left no survivors, and its precise cause remains under intensive investigation by agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). During a news briefing, local sheriffs released the victims' names, emphasizing the profound impact on the close-knit community and the urgent need to support their grieving families. Tributes poured in for those lost, including Mindy Clifton, a 20-year corrections veteran, and Rachel Woodall, a production manager, underscoring the deep personal connections affected by this tragedy.</p>

The flight saw the booster execute a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico as planned, with the spacecraft proceeding to skim space before its descent towards the Indian Ocean. This test incorporated enhanced maneuvering for the spacecraft, building upon the successes of prior flights and marking continued progress in the development of this reusable space transport system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside over 20 world leaders, attended a summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign a declaration cementing the Gaza ceasefire agreement. The "Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity" outlined commitments for diplomatic resolution and peace, though its text appeared largely symbolic. Notably absent was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing a Jewish holiday. Trump, who earlier praised Netanyahu in the Knesset, declared a "new dawn in the Middle East" and asserted the war was over, even as complexities regarding lasting peace and Gaza's future governance remain.</p>

          <p>Five individuals, including a child, were hospitalized after a helicopter crashed in Huntington Beach, Southern California, on Saturday afternoon. The incident occurred near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, with both occupants of the helicopter and three pedestrians on the street sustaining injuries. Dramatic video footage circulated on social media captured the helicopter spinning multiple times before it plummeted into palm trees and the outdoor stairway of a pedestrian bridge. Federal aviation authorities and the National Transportation Safety Board have been notified and are investigating the cause of the crash. The helicopter was identified as a Bell 222, and its registered owner reportedly suffered broken ribs and a fractured spine.</p>

The attorney points to ignored evidence, including a 3D recreation suggesting self-infliction of all wounds was impossible, unexplained bruises, and missing surveillance footage. This ruling follows years of legal challenges from her parents, who sought to change the manner of death to homicide or undetermined.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 247, legislation that will significantly increase the wages for California's incarcerated firefighters, raising them from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. These fire crews are a vital component of the state's wildfire suppression efforts, performing dangerous tasks like clearing brush and digging containment lines. The new law, which takes effect immediately and is supported by a $10 million budget allocation, addresses a long-standing social justice concern regarding their extremely low pay. This measure builds upon previous legislation from 2020 that allows nonviolent incarcerated individuals who worked on fire crews to have their records expunged, recognizing their critical contributions.</p>

The bill's author, Assemblymember Tina S. McKinnor, emphasized its focus on racial disparities and systemic barriers to sports participation.

          <p>Donna Adelson, the 75-year-old matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been sentenced to life in prison for the 2014 murder-for-hire of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel, a Florida State University law professor, was killed amidst a bitter custody dispute with Adelson's daughter. Adelson, found guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation, maintained her innocence and pledged to appeal, claiming a miscarriage of justice. This sentencing marks the fifth person convicted in the elaborate plot, which has captivated Florida with its sordid details of family tensions and a calculated killing.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 495, significantly easing the process for fire victims to claim personal property losses. The new law allows policyholders whose residences were totally destroyed to receive 60% of their personal property coverage, up to $350,000, without providing an itemized list. It also extends the claim filing period to at least 100 days. This legislation addresses previous inefficiencies that delayed financial support for survivors. Newsom also signed SB 429, which funds the nation's first public wildfire catastrophe model, aiming to create a transparent benchmark for insurance rate-setting in a climate-changed environment.</p>

          <p>As China begins drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive blueprint guiding its national development, the potential implications and opportunities for industrial collaboration across the Taiwan Strait are under close scrutiny. A recent visit by a delegation of Taiwanese executives, representing major companies like Delta Electronics, to leading mainland Chinese manufacturers highlighted explorations into potential partnerships, particularly within the burgeoning electric vehicle industry. This engagement signifies an evolving cross-strait relationship where Taiwanese firms increasingly contribute specialized components and parts to mainland Chinese companies in various high-tech sectors. The upcoming plan is expected to significantly influence the economic landscape and shape future business interactions between the two regions.</p>

          <p>Cameron McGerr, a 16-year-old from Scotland, is campaigning for mandatory CPR training in schools after losing both his parents to heart conditions. He believes that if he had known CPR, he might have saved his father, who died from cardiac arrest. Cameron's "Pulse of Life" campaign has already led his school to introduce the training and he presented his case to Scottish MSPs, highlighting the critical importance of immediate action. Health groups support his initiative, noting that widespread CPR knowledge could significantly improve the one-in-ten survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of Americans, including families like Shana Verstegen's, fear significant increases in healthcare costs if Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) premium tax credits expire at year-end. These federal subsidies, expanded during the pandemic, save families hundreds monthly, and their renewal is a key demand from Democrats in the ongoing government shutdown negotiations. Health policy experts warn that without an extension, up to seven million people might stop buying marketplace insurance, with four to five million potentially losing coverage entirely. The expiration could disproportionately affect conservative states that haven't expanded Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

Hegseth, a former Fox anchor, responded defiantly on social media, while a Pentagon spokesperson claimed reporters were having a "meltdown."

          <p>Security Minister Jarvis stated that National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell made no decisions regarding evidence in the collapsed China spy case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry. Charges were dropped because the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) could not classify China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses, a requirement exposed by recent case law. Jarvis refuted claims of government interference, asserting that the deputy national security adviser provided evidence without constraint. He blamed antiquated legislation and the previous Conservative government for not updating national security laws, which the 2023 National Security Act has since addressed.</p>
