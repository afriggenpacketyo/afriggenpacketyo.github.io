          <p>An explosion at a bar in Madrid's Puente de Vallecas district has injured at least 25 people, with several in serious condition. While a gas leak is the suspected cause, authorities have not yet confirmed the origin of the blast. The incident has rendered the building unstable, forcing the temporary relocation of residents from nine housing units. Firefighters have secured the area, confirming no one is trapped in the rubble.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, allowing approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar to legally work outside their border camps. This policy shift comes after significant cuts in international food aid, particularly from the U.S., which led to rising malnutrition. The move is praised by the UNHCR as a "turning point" that promotes self-sufficiency for refugees and could help fill labor shortages in the local economy. Refugees who have spent decades in camps now see a new opportunity for freedom and a future.</p>

          <p>Since the 2022 invasion, Russia has forcibly relocated tens of thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied territories, placing them in orphanages or with Russian families. Ukraine has made their return a prerequisite for any peace talks, while Russia denies the abductions, claiming it "rescued" the children. International pressure is mounting, with the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for the war crime of unlawful deportation. Despite these efforts, the process of reuniting children with their families remains slow and bureaucratic.</p>

The exercises involve heavy armored vehicles, naval deployments, and rehearsals for missile strikes, including the use of nuclear-capable Oreshnik missiles. The drills are causing significant concern among neighboring nations like Poland and Lithuania, especially after a recent Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace.

          <p>The FBI has increased its reward to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of a man who allegedly fired a pistol at federal officers during an immigration raid at a Camarillo cannabis farm. The July 10 raid on Glass House Farms resulted in over 300 arrests of suspected undocumented workers and sparked chaotic protests. During the turmoil, one worker died after falling from a height while trying to flee, and several protesters were injured in clashes with agents. The FBI emphasized that the investigation targets criminal assault on officers, not First Amendment-protected activities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has labeled the recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace as an "unacceptable and dangerous development." While condemning the act, Rubio stated that it is not yet clear whether Russia deliberately targeted Poland, a NATO member state. The incident prompted Poland to shoot down the drones, marking the first known instance of a NATO country firing on Russian targets during the Ukraine war. NATO has since announced plans to strengthen its eastern flank in response to the escalating situation.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers and advocates are raising alarms that approximately 1,000 unaccompanied children from Central America, including dozens in California, are at risk of being deported before their court cases are complete.

          <p>Following the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson for the assassination of Charlie Kirk, questions about his motivation remain a central focus, fueling intense political debate. Utah's governor stated that Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," though specific evidence has not been released. In the absence of a clear motive, public figures have offered contrasting reactions, with some calling for unity and prayer while others, including former President Trump, blame "radicals on the left." The incident has highlighted the deep political divisions in the U.S. and the rush to frame such events within existing partisan narratives.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office specifically questioned Lord Mandelson about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as ambassador to the US, the BBC understands. The questions arose after initial vetting flagged the relationship, but Mandelson's answers were deemed sufficient at the time. He was subsequently fired after newly surfaced emails showed him sending supportive messages to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. Downing Street sources now suggest Mandelson was "economical with the truth," leading to growing pressure on the Prime Minister over his judgment in the appointment.</p>

          <p>Economist David Rosenberg is warning that the stock market is in a "gigantic price bubble," pointing to extremely high valuations that historically precede negative returns. He highlights the Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio for the S&P 500, which is currently at its third-highest level ever. Historically, when the CAPE ratio has exceeded 35, one-year forward returns for the market have been negative. Rosenberg argues that these high valuations, combined with rising recession risks from a slowing labor market, signal potential trouble ahead for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an ultimatum to NATO allies, stating in a letter that the U.S. will only impose "major" new sanctions on Russia if they collectively agree to stop buying Russian oil. He criticized some allies for continuing to purchase Russian energy, claiming it weakens their negotiating position and shows a lack of commitment. Trump also called for NATO as a group to impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China, suggesting these combined actions would quickly end the war in Ukraine. The demands represent a significant shift and face an uncertain reception from allies.</p>

          <p>Arsenal demonstrated the value of their £250 million summer investment with a convincing 3-0 win against Nottingham Forest, despite missing several key players due to injury. With five new signings in the starting lineup, the team showed impressive depth and quality, cruising to victory without conceding a goal from open play. Manager Mikel Arteta justified the aggressive recruitment by pointing to the demanding schedule of domestic and Champions League football, stating the need for more high-caliber players to maintain standards. Newcomers like Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze were particularly impressive in the dominant performance.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed SB 53, a bill that would require developers of powerful "frontier" artificial intelligence models to publish detailed safety and security reports. The legislation aims to mitigate potential "catastrophic risks," such as AI-enabled bioweapons or massive cyberattacks, by mandating transparency and establishing whistleblower protections. While some in the industry argue the bill stifles innovation, proponents see it as a necessary, light-touch approach to governance in a rapidly evolving field. As the hub of AI innovation, California's law could set a precedent for AI regulation across the United States.</p>

          <p>A large homeless encampment in Los Angeles's Koreatown, which features an improvised tennis court, garden, and BBQ pit, has sparked outrage among local residents and highlighted bureaucratic dysfunction. The encampment, located on a privately owned, undeveloped lot, has become a symbol of the city's broader homelessness crisis. While city officials and the property owner are slowly taking steps to address the situation, the presence of such encampments can negatively impact local property values and quality of life. The article notes that this issue is a symptom of the larger lack of affordable housing and resources in the city.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, has stated that if elected, he would order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes. Citing an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant, Mamdani asserted his intention to uphold international law, despite the U.S. not recognizing the ICC's jurisdiction. Legal experts have described the potential move as a "practical impossibility" that would create a direct conflict with the federal government. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, currently holds a significant lead in the polls for the November election.</p>

          <p>New documents show that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described a condominium she purchased in 2021 as a "vacation home" on a loan estimate form. This characterization could weaken the Trump administration's claims that she committed mortgage fraud by allegedly declaring two different properties as her primary residence simultaneously. President Trump has sought to fire Cook "for cause" based on these allegations, a move she is currently fighting in court. The dispute comes as the Fed is set to meet on interest rates, and it represents an unprecedented attempt by a president to remove a Fed board member.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County judge has dismissed the sweeping racketeering (RICO) conspiracy charges against 61 individuals who protested the construction of an Atlanta police training center known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the Georgia Attorney General's office lacked the proper authority to bring the RICO case after local district attorneys had declined to do so. The decision is a major blow to the state's two-year effort to prosecute the protest movement using a law typically reserved for organized crime. The state has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>
