          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not agree to a trade deal with the U.S. under President Trump unless all new tariffs are reconsidered, highlighting the disagreement over negotiable tariffs. The U.S. is unwilling to remove tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, while Japan seeks their elimination, especially concerned about the 25% duties on the auto industry, which represents a significant portion of Japan's exports to the U.S. Despite ongoing negotiations, Japan remains firm on its stance, emphasizing its commitment to protecting its national interests in tariff talks with the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 25% tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, intended to incentivize domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign imports, follow earlier levies on imported cars, with exemptions for parts from Canada and Mexico meeting North American trade agreement requirements. Automakers and suppliers warn that relocating assembly lines will take years, and uncertainty surrounding trade policy hinders investment in domestic manufacturing. The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles, impacting consumer affordability. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:34:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) teaches caregivers to avoid 'elderspeak,' a form of communication resembling baby talk that can undermine older adults' sense of dignity. The program, developed by researchers at the University of Iowa and the University of Kansas, includes videos demonstrating appropriate and inappropriate communication techniques. Studies have shown that reducing elderspeak can decrease resistance to care and lower the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes. The training emphasizes addressing older adults respectfully, avoiding terms of endearment, and using appropriate language and tone.</p>

          <p>Following internal reports revealing the presence of antisemitism and Islamophobia at Harvard University, adjunct professor Eugene Litvak expressed that the university was unprepared for the challenges after the October 7 Hamas attack. Litvak commended Harvard's president for acknowledging the problem, while also emphasizing the importance of addressing the financial challenges facing public healthcare programs like Medicaid and Medicare. Meanwhile, President Trump announced plans to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, leading to ongoing tensions between the administration and the university, including a lawsuit over frozen research grants. Litvak also suggests that reducing government spending on healthcare could help solve the looming crisis.</p>

          <p>The retrial of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend, has commenced under intense scrutiny, with special prosecutor Hank Brennan leading the case. The trial hinges on conflicting narratives: whether Read ran over O'Keefe or if he was killed inside a house and the scene was staged. Key points of contention include the lack of collision injuries on O'Keefe's body, the presence of dog scratches, and inconsistencies in witness testimonies. The defense is focusing on undermining witness testimony and highlighting the close-knit community of Canton, while the prosecution is emphasizing forensic data. The outcome remains uncertain given the complex evidence and the shadow of a botched police investigation.</p>

Albanese's victory comes amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration, influencing Australian voters.

Key areas of focus include resisting central government's placement of asylum seekers in Reform-led counties and auditing council jobs to ensure value for money. Despite inexperience among newly-elected councillors, Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice believes this will be an advantage, bringing fresh perspectives and common sense.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent BBC interview exposed deep rifts within the Royal Family, particularly concerning security arrangements in the UK. Harry expressed his sadness over the lack of contact between his children and the wider family, and the lack of communication with his father due to security issues. He also voiced a desire for reconciliation, suggesting that security is a "sticking point". Buckingham Palace responded with a statement indicating these issues have been repeatedly examined by the courts, while the Home Office defended the UK's security system as "rigorous and proportionate."</p>

          <p>Following a week of bloodshed, Druse leaders in Ashrafieh Sahnaya, Syria, have agreed to integrate militia fighters into government forces in exchange for government concessions. This decision comes after deadly clashes between Druse fighters, government forces, and Sunni extremists, incited by a debunked audio clip. While some residents express skepticism, the agreement represents a shift in the Druse militias' stance, who had previously resisted integration into the national military. The violence, which included Israeli airstrikes, underscores the shaky security situation and sectarian tensions in Syria.</p>
