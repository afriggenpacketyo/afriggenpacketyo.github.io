          <p>Tesla announced a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue to $28.10 billion, marking a return to growth after two consecutive quarters of declines and beating analyst estimates. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents fell short of predictions, causing the stock to drop in extended trading. The lower profitability was attributed to reduced electric vehicle prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly for AI and other R&D projects. The report also highlighted challenges such as a sales slump in Europe and the recent expiration of U.S. federal tax credits, which had previously pulled sales forward into the quarter.

          <p>Southwest Airlines significantly outperformed Wall Street expectations by reporting a surprise third-quarter profit, with adjusted earnings of 11 cents per share against a consensus forecast of a loss. The carrier also issued a strong forecast for the remainder of the year, anticipating continued robust travel demand and higher fares, with unit revenue expected to rise between 1% and 3% in the fourth quarter. This positive financial performance comes as the airline undergoes strategic shifts, including abandoning long-standing policies like open seating, in an effort to better compete with its rivals and increase overall sales.

          <p>Shares of Beyond Meat showcased extreme market volatility as a meme stock-fueled rally quickly collapsed, with the stock closing down 1.1% after having surged by as much as 112% earlier in the same session. The initial spike was attributed to its inclusion in a specialized meme stock ETF, which appeared to trigger a short squeeze among investors. This event is reminiscent of the retail trading frenzies seen during the pandemic. The plant-based food company's stock has been under significant long-term pressure, and this recent fluctuation has sparked commentary about potential market frothiness and the unpredictable nature of such trades.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is set to impose a "substantial" new package of sanctions against Russia, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as the conflict in Ukraine continues. This announcement coincides with a visit from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte to the White House to discuss President Trump's peace initiatives. The move follows recent intense Russian drone and missile strikes in Ukraine that resulted in at least seven deaths, including two children. The specific details of the sanctions have not yet been released, but they come as U.S. lawmakers have been awaiting a green light from the administration to pass a broader sanctions bill.</p>

          <p>President Trump has formally requested approximately $230 million from the Department of Justice through two administrative claims to settle damages from past federal investigations into his conduct. The claims, which relate to the Russia interference probe and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, have raised serious conflict of interest concerns. This is because the top DOJ officials who would be tasked with approving such a taxpayer-funded settlement, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward, previously served as Trump's personal defense attorneys in those very cases. Critics are calling for their recusal.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official has confirmed that the entire East Wing of the White House will be demolished to accommodate the construction of a new, large ballroom championed by President Donald Trump. This decision reverses a previous promise that the East Wing's structure would remain untouched, with the change being attributed to unspecified "structural reasons." The $250 million project is reportedly being funded by private donors, including a $22 million contribution from Alphabet as part of a legal settlement with Trump, and has drawn public anger over the destruction of the historic wing.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S. cattle ranchers "don't understand" the benefits of his tariffs after they publicly criticized his proposal to import beef from Argentina to lower domestic consumer prices. In a social media post, he claimed his trade policies were the sole reason for the ranchers' recent success and insisted they must also get their prices down. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and several Republican senators have strongly opposed the plan, arguing that direct government intervention in the market will ultimately harm American producers and create chaos at a critical time of year.</p>

          <p>The Minnesota Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that USA Powerlifting engaged in discriminatory practices by barring a transgender athlete, JayCee Cooper, from competing in a women's event in 2018. The court found that the organization's policy of categorically excluding transgender women from the women's division was a facial violation of the state's Human Rights Act. However, the ruling also sent a portion of the case back to a lower court to determine whether USA Powerlifting has a "legitimate business purpose" for its policy.

Additionally, a strengthening U.S. dollar, rising real yields, and an easing of geopolitical and economic fears have collectively reduced gold's appeal as a traditional safe-haven asset.

Avian flu alone has impacted over three million turkeys in 2025.

          <p>According to a new analysis by Oxford Economics, many American taxpayers may receive larger tax refunds in 2026 because of the retroactive provisions in the Republicans' latest tax cut legislation. The law, which extends the 2017 cuts and adds new breaks like an increased SALT deduction cap, is projected to deliver an additional $50 billion in savings. Since the IRS has not yet updated its payroll withholding tables to reflect these changes, many employees are likely overpaying their 2025 taxes and will receive the difference as a refund. The analysis also notes that a disproportionate share of the benefits will go to upper-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the current Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean Sea and is projected to bring heavy rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica over the next several days. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting that the slow-moving storm could produce 5 to 10 inches of rain in some areas, creating a significant risk of flash flooding and landslides. While Melissa has the potential to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday, its longer-term track remains uncertain, with current models suggesting it is unlikely to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <h2>Commentary: Trump's Demolition of White House East Wing Seen as a Powerful Metaphor</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing demolition of the White House's East Wing for a new ballroom is being interpreted by critics as a potent, if on-the-nose, metaphor for the Trump presidency. Presidential historians and commentators are framing the physical destruction of a part of the historic executive mansion as symbolic of what they see as the president's broader dismantling of political norms and institutions. While the White House has defended the project as a "visionary addition" akin to past presidential renovations, President Trump himself has celebrated the construction noise, calling it "music to my ears" and a sound that reminds him of money.</p>

          <h2>California's Proposition 50 Support Driven by National Politics and Opposition to Trump, Poll Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that voter support for California's Proposition 50, a state-level ballot measure concerning redistricting, is being heavily influenced by national political sentiments. A clear majority of those planning to vote "yes" on the measure cite their opposition to the Trump administration as a primary motivation. These voters tend to view the proposition as a tool to oppose national Republicans, whom they feel treat California unfairly. Conversely, opponents of the measure are more focused on state-specific concerns, such as a potential shift in power from rural to urban areas, but their numbers are currently smaller.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor, speaking for over 21 hours to protest the policies of the Trump administration. Beginning Tuesday evening and continuing through Wednesday, Merkley railed against the administration's deportation efforts, the perceived "weaponization" of the Justice Department, and the controversial deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland. In one of the longest Senate addresses in recent years, Merkley described the current political climate as the "biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War," stating he had come to the floor to "ring the alarm bells."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent layoffs at several artificial intelligence startups, including the dismissal of 600 employees within Meta's AI unit, point to a disruptive trend in the tech industry. When large technology companies acquire or make significant investments in smaller AI firms, the workforces of those startups often face immediate restructuring and job cuts as the parent company moves to eliminate duplicate functions. This approach marks a shift from past acquisition strategies that often prioritized retaining a startup's unique culture and talent. Analysts suggest this reflects a broader push by big tech toward leaner staffing and flatter organizational structures.</p>

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has issued a formal demand for Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the government's files on Jeffrey Epstein. The demand was prompted by the posthumous publication of a memoir by survivor Virginia Giuffre, which Garcia states contains horrific allegations that contradict the Justice Department's earlier claim that the files did not justify further investigation. Garcia accused the attorney general of disregarding a congressional subpoena and raised serious questions about the department's motives for continuing to withhold the documents from the committee.</p>

          <p>Thames Valley Police have concluded their investigation and will not file charges against four men who were arrested for projecting an image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein onto the walls of Windsor Castle. The protest took place in September during the president's state visit to the United Kingdom. The men had been arrested on suspicion of offenses including malicious communications and public nuisance. The political campaign group Led By Donkeys claimed responsibility for the nine-minute projection, which was intended to highlight questions about the president's relationship with the disgraced financier, and called the arrests a "ridiculous overreaction."</p>
