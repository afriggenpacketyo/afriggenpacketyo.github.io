          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, with experts attributing this trend to factors like poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation has reduced citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of cheap, processed foods with low nutritional value. Researchers also warn of the risks associated with toxic chemicals in food production, including pesticides that can disrupt hormones and cause weight gain. The Turkish Health Ministry has launched a public health campaign to combat obesity, but critics argue that it stigmatizes overweight individuals and overlooks broader economic struggles.</p>

The government announced a Â£1.5 billion investment in new defence factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK, supporting the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. The review acknowledges a "new era of threat" and the "immediate and pressing" danger posed by Russia, addressing deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions, and the UK's depleted stockpiles.

          <p>Donald Trump's approach to China, characterized by aggression and perceived weakness, is increasing the risk of a conflict over Taiwan, according to Simon Tisdall. Xi Jinping may see an opportunity to unify Taiwan with China due to Trump's chaotic tariffs, isolationist policies, and disruption of alliances. The US's policy of "strategic ambiguity" has turned into one of chronic pusillanimity under Trump, emboldening China. Trump's policies are driven by self-interest, money, and fear, not principles, treaties, or laws, making the US appear beatable to China.</p>

She shares stories of patients who, facing death, reconcile the differences between the life they have and the one they longed for. The author contrasts the idea of clichÃ© bucket lists with the more complicated version of the ordinary that people often seek when reflecting on mortality. These wishes often involve mending relationships or achieving long-postponed personal goals.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite its potential impact on medal prospects. Head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries being reported among growing children. While World Skate also mandated a minimum age of 12 for other international tournaments, Japanese organizers kept recent domestic competitions open to future stars aged between 7 and 10. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after a doping scandal at the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.</p>

          <p>South Korean women who played a key role in protests leading to the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk Yeol say they feel invisible again as the country prepares to elect a new president. The two main candidates have been largely silent about equality for women, and a third candidate with anti-feminist views is gaining popularity among young men. These women feel that their voices are being erased, despite their efforts to make the world a better place. They are frustrated by the lack of attention to gender equality in the current election cycle.</p>
