          <p>Canada's 2025 federal election saw Mark Carney's Liberal Party projected to win enough seats to form a government, though it remains unclear whether they will secure a majority. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, are expected to remain the opposition. The Liberals and Conservatives dominated the popular vote, securing a combined 90% of seats, while smaller parties like the NDP experienced a decline in support. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, particularly between the oil-rich provinces and the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars is initiating a $1.9 billion cost-cutting program due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter of the year, with profits falling from 4.7 billion krona to 1.9 billion krona. The cost-cutting measures include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations. The company is also adjusting its U.S. product lineup to focus on growth and is exploring ways to optimize its manufacturing footprint. Volvo Cars has withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, citing market headwinds, price competition, and the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a comeback victory in the Canadian election, fueled by anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over the country's economic survival. Carney framed the election as a fight against Trump's threats to Canada's sovereignty, warning that the U.S. president aimed to exploit the country. The Conservatives made gains but fell short of victory, while divisions within Canada were highlighted by the election results. Carney plans to prioritize trade negotiations with the U.S. and focus on strengthening Canada's economy.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower economic growth in the first quarter of 2025, with its GDP increasing by 5.2%, falling short of the national growth rate of 5.4%. The city's exports declined by 8.7% during the quarter, while China's overall exports rose by 6.9%. This underperformance is attributed to a high baseline from the previous year and pressures from the tariff war with the U.S. and industrial transition. Some enterprises in Shenzhen face high costs and insufficient orders, putting pressure on foreign trade and exports.</p>

          <p>Australia's wine export surge to China, following the lifting of trade barriers, is showing signs of slowing down, despite a significant increase in the past year. Exports totaled just over A$1 billion in the 12 months to March 31, 2025, but have decreased in recent months. This slowdown occurs amid a broader global decline in wine consumption, particularly in China. China's trade barriers, previously imposed during a political dispute, contributed to Australia's wine glut, leading to vineyard closures and lower grape prices.</p>

          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to milk-based drinks, including milkshakes and lattes, as well as non-dairy substitutes. The government is also considering reducing the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy. The sugar tax, known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), was introduced in 2018 to tackle obesity. Opponents argue that the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to address the root causes of obesity.</p>

          <p>A major power outage affected large parts of Spain and Portugal, disrupting daily life for millions. Subway and railway trains were halted, phone service was cut, and traffic lights and ATMs stopped working. Spanish power distributor Red Eléctrica reported that about 99% of the power capacity had been restored across the country early Tuesday morning. The cause of the outage is still being determined, with a problem in the European grid being cited as a possible reason.</p>

          <p>The model of football associated with Pep Guardiola is shaping the present and future of the game, with three of Guardiola's disciples reaching the Champions League semi-finals. This style emphasizes positional football and a cultural framework that prioritizes structure and strategy. While some critics argue it removes spontaneity, it has become a winning model, influencing clubs and academies across Europe. This approach represents a shift from a culture that prioritized structured defense and freedom in attack to a more integrated system.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen an unprecedented use of executive orders, with more than a quarter of them facing legal challenges. These orders have restructured the way the United States is governed and changed the course of foreign and domestic policy. Many of Trump's executive orders are based on personal preference and vengeance, rather than policy priorities. All three branches of the US government have the legal power to overturn executive orders, but legislation is a much more durable route for achieving lasting policy change.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's rapid and radical program of change in his first 100 days is fraught with political risk. Opinion polls suggest the public is less enthusiastic than his base, and his approval rating is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years. Potential scenarios that could derail his agenda include a tariff dream turning into a recession nightmare, a constitutional crisis over immigration, and a DOGE spinning out of control. The success of the Trump administration hinges on balancing ambitions to reset the global trading order with the impact on average American consumers.</p>
