            <p>The bond market experienced a sharp sell-off, with the 10-year Treasury yield briefly spiking above 4.5%, raising concerns on Wall Street about a potential recession. This unusual behavior, where bond yields rise instead of falling during economic uncertainty, suggests investors are losing confidence in bonds as a safe haven. The market reaction coincides with President Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods and China's retaliatory measures, exacerbating fears of a global trade war and its impact on economic stability. The iShares 20+ year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) also reflected this downturn, falling 5% this week (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Investors are reportedly fleeing to German bonds as Trump's tariffs spark a sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, driven by concerns about geopolitical volatility and the U.S. dollar's diminishing safe-haven status. While U.S. Treasury yields are rising, indicating decreased demand, German bonds are bucking the trend as investors seek stability amid trade war uncertainties. Analysts suggest that China's potential move away from U.S. debt holdings in response to Trump's policies is contributing to the Treasury sell-off. The situation has drawn comparisons to the UK's 2022 "mini budget" crisis, raising fears of financial instability (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>President Trump's escalating trade war, marked by increasing tariffs, has created an opportunity for China to position itself as a defender of the global economic order. China's foreign ministry has criticized the US for violating WTO rules and undermining multilateralism, appealing to countries in the Global South. While the US is seen as disrupting the established international system, China is attempting to portray itself as a responsible global power. The key question is whether China can effectively capitalize on this diplomatic opening and strengthen its relationships with aggrieved parties.</p>

            <p>A New York pediatrician, Stuart Copperman, has been ordered to pay $1.6 billion to 104 women, including a priest in Las Vegas, after being accused of sexual abuse spanning from the 1980s. Copperman, who was never criminally charged, had his medical license revoked in 2000 following complaints from former patients. The lawsuits were made possible by New York's Child Victims Act, which temporarily lifted statute of limitations laws. The court ruled in favor of the women due to Copperman's failure to respond to the litigation, marking one of the largest cumulative awards against a single individual in the U.S.</p>

            <p>A new report reveals that top US companies spent three times more on share buybacks than on taxes after the 2017 Trump tax cuts, using the savings to enrich investors rather than lower prices for consumers. Eleven major consumer goods corporations collectively recorded nearly $500 billion in profits since the cuts, enacting $463 billion in buybacks while paying only $140 billion in federal taxes. Critics argue that these buybacks exacerbate wealth inequality, as companies prioritize shareholder returns over reinvestment and wage increases.

            <p>Volatility in financial markets led to a sharp drop in mortgage interest rates last week, resulting in a 20% jump in mortgage application volume, reaching the highest level since September 2024. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 6.61%, spurring refinancing activity and increased home purchase demand. Adjustable-rate mortgages also saw a rise in popularity, as borrowers sought to take advantage of lower initial rates. However, the increase in mortgage demand may be short-lived, as rates have already begun to climb again this week (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Prominent Trump supporters, including Bill Ackman and Razib Khan, are expressing regret over their decision to support Trump due to his implementation of sweeping tariffs. These individuals, who initially backed Trump for his stance on cultural issues, now worry about the economic consequences of his trade policies. They admit to underestimating the potential for Trump's non-cultural ideas, like tariffs, to cause significant economic harm. The dissent reflects a growing unease within the right-wing coalition regarding the Trump administration's economic direction.</p>

            <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is facing significant disruptions due to the Secretary of Commerce personally reviewing all contracts with commitments above $100,000. This has led to backups, uncertainty, and the potential lapse of critical services, including website maintenance, emergency alert translations, and facility upkeep. The unusual level of scrutiny has raised concerns about the technical merit of contract decisions and the potential for data loss. NOAA, responsible for weather forecasts and oceanic research, relies heavily on contractors, making the situation even more precarious.</p>

The government has offered £500m to support a switch to electric arc furnaces, but the company has rejected the move.

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs on nearly all of the U.S.'s trading partners have taken effect, causing U.S. businesses to incur additional costs on imported products.

The Supreme Court has also allowed the Trump administration to proceed with firing 16,000 probationary federal employees, adding to the administration's controversial policies.
