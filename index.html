        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a significant opportunity for investors to pay a 0% long-term capital gains tax rate due to changes in President Trump's recent tax legislation. For 2025, the 0% rate applies to single filers with taxable income up to $48,350 and married couples up to $96,700. The bill's increased standard deduction and other breaks could allow more people to qualify, enabling strategies like "tax-gain harvesting" to sell profitable assets tax-free or reset their cost basis for future savings. This financial strategy is presented as a "golden opportunity" for those who fall within the new income thresholds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing financial pressures that have led to widespread closures, independent rural hospitals across the United States are increasingly forming "clinically integrated networks." These collaborations allow them to remain autonomous while pooling resources to negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units and to qualify for value-based care contracts. The Rough Rider Network in North Dakota, for example, helps 22 hospitals share costs and improve patient outreach for preventive care. This model offers a viable alternative to being acquired by larger health systems or shutting down entirely, preserving local jobs and healthcare access.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been discharged from the hospital and is reportedly "recovering well" following a car crash in New Hampshire. The incident occurred on Interstate 93 after Giuliani and an associate had stopped to assist a woman involved in a domestic violence situation. Their vehicle was then struck from behind by another car, which police have confirmed was not connected to the initial domestic incident. Giuliani was diagnosed with a fractured thoracic vertebrae and other injuries, but his spokesperson stated the crash was not a targeted attack.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, the co-creator of the comedy series 'Father Ted,' was arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence through his posts on the social media platform X. The arrest, conducted by five officers, reportedly relates to three posts from April concerning his views on transgender individuals in female-only spaces. Linehan stated his bail conditions prohibit him from using X, and he has defended his posts as making a serious point with a joke. The arrest has sparked a significant backlash and a debate on free speech, with figures like author JK Rowling and politicians criticizing the police action as disproportionate.</p>

Now, his cognitive decline prevents her from leaving, yet she struggles with the expectation to provide loving care to someone she no longer feels connected to. The columnist advises her to release any guilt, acknowledging the immense difficulty of her situation, and to find small, personal ways to care for her own well-being.</p>

The court found that Morgan shot Scott six times outside a gym in February 2024 as an act of revenge. The motive stemmed from a 2020 incident where Scott, while on duty, confiscated a phone from Morgan's cell, which exposed Morgan's illicit relationship with another officer. The judge called the killing a "cold-blooded execution," and Scott's family delivered powerful statements in court, remembering him as a brave and principled man.</p>

Despite Musk's ambitious forecast of turning Tesla into a $25 trillion company on the back of Optimus, the company faces stiff competition in both the robotaxi and humanoid robot markets.

          <p>Hundreds of prominent economists, including several Nobel laureates, have co-signed an open letter denouncing President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The letter argues that this action threatens the Federal Reserve's crucial independence from political pressure, which is a cornerstone of the U.S. financial system. Trump sought to fire Cook for "cause" based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which the economists described as "unproven accusations." The signatories expressed their support for Governor Cook and the institutional safeguards that protect the central bank from day-to-day politics.</p>

          <p>Gabby Thomas, the Olympic champion in the 200m, has withdrawn from the upcoming World Athletics Championships in Tokyo due to an Achilles tendon injury. Thomas, who also won gold on two relay teams in Paris, has been managing the injury since May and exacerbated it in July. In her announcement, she emphasized the importance of prioritizing long-term health, stating that "it's OK to be human and take care of myself." The 28-year-old athlete was not at her best during the recent US nationals but still managed to secure a spot on the team before making this difficult decision.</p>

          <p>San Diego Padres relief pitcher Jason Adam will miss the remainder of the season after rupturing a quad tendon while fielding a ball in a recent game. The injury is a significant blow to the Padres, as Adam has been exceptionally effective, particularly against their division rivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 15 career appearances against the Dodgers, Adam has never allowed a run, making him a uniquely dominant force in the close pennant race. His absence will be deeply felt in the Padres' bullpen as they head into the final month of the season.</p>

A strong prior payment history can also improve the chances of approval.
