            <p>Mikal Mahdi, convicted of two separate murders in 2004, was executed by firing squad in South Carolina after his appeals were rejected by state and federal courts. Mahdi chose this method over lethal injection or the electric chair. His lawyers argued ineffective counsel during his original trial, while prosecutors highlighted his violent nature and prison misconduct. The execution marked the second firing squad execution in South Carolina in five weeks. </p>

            <p>Alaska lawmakers face uncertainty in crafting the state budget due to volatile oil prices influenced by President Trump's tariff policies. The fluctuations have exacerbated tensions over allocating funds between the yearly oil-wealth fund dividend and essential services like education. With little interest in raising taxes, lawmakers are struggling to address recurring budget deficits. The situation is further complicated by hopes that tariffs could encourage countries to invest in Alaska's liquefied natural gas project. (not investment advice)</p>
