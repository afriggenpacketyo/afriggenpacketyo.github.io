          <p>The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, by a single vote. Speaker Mike Johnson humorously mentioned that Representative Andrew Garbarino missed the vote because he fell asleep, despite his crucial role in negotiations. Garbarino stated he was moments away from the House floor when the vote closed, emphasizing his efforts to lift the cap on SALT deductions for Long Island families. The bill, which includes raising the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 for certain incomes, now heads to the Senate, facing an uncertain future due to Republican skepticism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is investigating Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's admissions policies following claims of discrimination against Asian American applicants. Virginia's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, found reasonable cause that the school's revised admissions process, implemented in 2020 to promote diversity, disadvantaged Asian American students. These changes included eliminating standardized testing and application fees, and setting aside spots for students from each middle school. While a federal appeals court upheld the policy, the investigation continues under the Trump administration, focusing on potential Title VI violations.</p>

          <p>Eight migrants are being held in Djibouti after a judge blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deport them to South Sudan, citing a violation of due process rights. President Trump criticized the judge's decision, while attorneys argued that the migrants face potential harm if deported to the violence-ridden South Sudan. The Department of Homeland Security identified the migrants as nationals of various countries with criminal records, including sexual assault and murder. The judge ordered "reasonable fear" interviews for the migrants, allowing them to challenge their removal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration released a report from the MAHA Commission, chaired by Health Secretary Robert F.

The report identifies poor diet, environmental chemicals, chronic stress, lack of physical activity, and overmedicalization as key factors. It also suggests corporate influence in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries contributes to the problem. While acknowledging the report's diagnosis of the issues, some experts raise concerns about the lack of focus on socioeconomic factors and ongoing cuts to public health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining current foreign students, citing an unsafe campus environment due to anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated Harvard's certification was revoked because of its failure to comply with federal immigration laws and for fostering violence and antisemitism. Harvard called the revocation unlawful and asserted its commitment to its international students. A federal judge issued an injunction against the administration, potentially blocking the action against currently enrolled international students.</p>

The new review, using the DOD's terms, found only about 20 books needing removal pending further review.

          <p>Republicans in Congress are advancing a bill that would impose work requirements for Medicaid recipients, potentially causing millions to lose their health benefits. The GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act would require able-bodied adults without children to report at least 80 hours of work or community activity monthly to maintain Medicaid coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over 10 million people could lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 due to this and other provisions.

          <p>Senate Republicans are vowing to make changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by the House, which includes tax cuts and significant cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. Several Republican senators have expressed concerns about the deep cuts to healthcare, with some stating they cannot support such measures. The bill's future is uncertain as any Senate rollback of Medicaid cuts could face resistance from the House Freedom Caucus, which seeks even deeper cuts. The bill also includes funding for border security, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime, and renews the 2017 tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is experiencing volatility as investors express concerns about the U.S. national deficit, leading to a "Sell America" trade. Investors are selling off U.S. government bonds, causing yields on 30-year Treasuries to spike. The European Central Bank warned that President Trump's tariffs pose risks to the global financial system, and Moody's downgraded the U.S. creditworthiness due to the rising deficit. This trend reflects a shift in narrative around U.S. economic exceptionalism and a perception that the U.S. is a riskier place to invest.</p>

          <p>A White House report led by Health Secretary Robert F.

The report calls American children "the sickest generation in American history" and points to corporate influence in federal policymaking. It questions vaccine safety and suggests links to childhood disease have not been thoroughly studied, conflicting with scientific consensus. The report proposes new research and a shift towards prevention but faces skepticism due to budget cuts and dismantled public health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports and precursor chemicals led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the U.S., reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over three to five months. The strict drug control policy, implemented in May 2019, added all fentanyl-related substances to China's list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that without China's restrictions, nearly 1,000 more Americans would have died from fentanyl overdoses.</p>
