          <p>Protests erupted across Indonesia following the death of ride-sharing driver Affan Kurniawan, who was fatally struck by a police vehicle during ongoing demonstrations against low wages and politicians' expenses. The unrest escalated, resulting in three deaths, injuries, and the burning of a council building, with tear gas deployed in several cities. President Prabowo Subianto, facing a key test of his leadership, apologized to Kurniawan's family and pledged a thorough investigation, while seven police officers faced ethical violations. The ongoing demonstrations underscore deep-seated grievances, with calls for justice for Kurniawan and an end to the violence.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men aged 18-22 to leave the country freely, aiming to provide educational and employment opportunities abroad to benefit Ukraine's future development. Previously, men 18-60 were restricted due to conscription concerns, though the draft primarily targeted those 25 and older. While the government hopes this will maintain ties and encourage eventual return, demographers are skeptical, fearing it may exacerbate the exodus of young men. The policy seeks to balance wartime needs with preventing a "lost generation" but faces debate over its demographic impact.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's expansion of speedy deportations for undocumented migrants in the U.S. interior. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's ruling suggests that the administration's actions may infringe upon individuals' due process rights, asserting that all individuals are entitled to process under the Fifth Amendment. This decision is a setback for President Trump's campaign promise to significantly increase deportations, curtailing the use of expedited removal for migrants beyond border regions. The judge clarified that the ruling does not question the constitutionality of expedited removal itself, but rather its broad application without due process.</p>

          <p>Satellite images analyzed by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab show an extensive earthen wall, over 31km long, being constructed around the besieged Sudanese city of el-Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This barrier is believed to be intended to trap civilians inside, exacerbating dire humanitarian conditions, with reports of deliberate targeting of civilians and hospitals. El-Fasher, the army's last major stronghold in Darfur, faces constant bombardment, food scarcity, and limited medical access. This article highlights a severe humanitarian crisis and the potential for the city's fall to give the RSF full control of Darfur.</p>

The article suggests Chinese equities offer "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI, with significant room to catch up to global markets. This positive outlook signals a potential reversal of previous underperformance and an increasing flow of foreign capital into China's onshore and offshore equities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with 385 out of 439 fires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land attributed to army maneuvers. Unexploded shells from past training, including from WWII, often hinder firefighting efforts, forcing fires in "Range Danger Areas" to burn out naturally. Locals express concerns about smoke pollution, health risks, and environmental impact, advocating for a ban on live-fire training during dry months. The MoD asserts a robust wildfire policy, but the article highlights a persistent issue and calls for more preventative measures.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's efforts to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, upholding a lower court's ruling. The court found that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to vacate a prior TPS extension, emphasizing that the TPS statute was designed to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This decision offers a path for many Venezuelans to maintain legal status, despite some having already faced job losses or deportation. The ruling represents a significant legal victory for immigrant rights advocates, affirming the stability of humanitarian protections.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has vehemently criticized a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling it an "invasion" and asserting President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction. Pritzker stated that the administration has not communicated with Illinois regarding such a deployment, which would echo similar federal interventions in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. The governor suggested Trump's actions might aim to influence future elections, calling it "an attack on the American people." The White House, however, dismissed Pritzker's accusations, attributing his comments to a desire to deflect from Chicago's crime crisis.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a cut of $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding across 15 international programs, using a rarely invoked "pocket rescission" procedure. This move bypasses Congress, which typically holds the power to allocate spending, and has drawn strong opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who deem it illegal. Critics, including Senator Susan Collins, argue it undermines the law and could increase the likelihood of a federal government shutdown. The administration defends its action as having a "solid legal basis" and aligns with Trump's "America First" agenda, significantly impacting USAID and peacekeeping missions.

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine, published in JAMA Network Open, indicates that young children aged 3-5 diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too quickly, often before behavioral interventions are attempted.

Researchers noted a high likelihood of treatment failure due to side effects like irritability.
