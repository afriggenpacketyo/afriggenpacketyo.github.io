        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for Reform UK, has voluntarily given up the party whip pending an investigation into allegations concerning his business activities. The claims, published by the Sunday Times, relate to the alleged misuse of the government's Bounce Back loan scheme during the COVID-19 pandemic, before he became an MP. McMurdock is accused of borrowing £70,000 through two companies that may not have met the turnover requirements for such loans. He maintains that his business dealings were lawful and compliant, and he has requested the temporary suspension to protect the party during the inquiry.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the most recent U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework. U.S. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a deal could be imminent. However, Israeli officials have indicated that while there is cabinet support for the terms, Israel has not yet formally committed to the agreement. This diplomatic movement occurs amidst the ongoing war, which has led to over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, following the initial Hamas attack on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a nation none of them are from, following a prolonged legal battle. The men, originally from countries including Cuba, Mexico, and Vietnam, were deported after federal judges, citing Supreme Court orders, denied a final attempt to halt the move. This action represents a significant development in the administration's immigration policy, aiming to have countries accept non-citizen deportees. Human rights advocates have condemned the decision, expressing fears for the men's safety in the conflict-ridden country and calling the act punitive and unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>During a historic 18-1 defeat of the Los Angeles Dodgers by the Houston Astros, Dodgers broadcaster and former pitcher Orel Hershiser alluded to the Astros' 2017 sign-stealing scandal. As the Astros dominated, Hershiser remarked that they seemed to be hitting breaking balls "like they know what is coming," reviving old tensions from the controversial World Series. The game was the worst loss in Dodger Stadium history, with Astros player Jose Altuve, a member of the 2017 team, hitting two home runs despite relentless booing from the crowd. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed his disappointment, noting his team's poor performance and the Astros' apparent ability to anticipate pitches.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes against Iran could reinforce North Korea's belief that a nuclear arsenal is essential for regime survival, according to policy experts. Analysts suggest that Pyongyang may view the U.S. actions as unpredictable and not based on traditional security logic, diminishing trust in diplomatic engagement with Washington. This perception could lead North Korea to further invest in making its nuclear weapons more mobile and resilient, effectively ending any remaining possibility of denuclearization. The developments are a setback for diplomatic efforts, which saw historic but ultimately unsuccessful talks between former President Trump and Kim Jong-un aimed at dismantling the country's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>A beverage known as the "cortisol cocktail" has gained popularity on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The alcohol-free drink typically contains coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients can significantly reduce cortisol levels, which are naturally regulated by the body. While the drink is generally harmless and can aid hydration, doctors caution that it may not be suitable for individuals with certain conditions like chronic kidney disease or diabetes due to its magnesium, potassium, and sugar content.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter, invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine is considered a pivotal artifact in the history of modern Chinese computing, as it ingeniously solved the challenge of typing a language with thousands of pictographs instead of an alphabet. Its system, which breaks down characters by shape, is a conceptual forerunner to modern input methods for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The typewriter's discovery has excited scholars, who see it as a symbol of preserving cultural identity while embracing technological modernity, reflecting Lin's vision for a globally connected China.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested more than 20 individuals for demonstrating in support of Palestine Action, a group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the day of the protest. The designation makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, with potential penalties of up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban Palestine Action following an incident where its members allegedly caused an estimated £7 million in damage to military aircraft at RAF Brize Norton. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper cited the group's "long history of unacceptable criminal damage" as justification for the ban.</p>

Historians and scientists note that early 20th-century attempts to classify humans into distinct races based on physical traits were chaotic and inconsistent. The development of population genetics shifted the focus from static racial types to understanding human evolution and variation through dynamic genetic populations. Scientists now argue that while physical differences exist, they are not meaningful enough to create distinct biological racial categories, and that cultural factors are more significant drivers of differences among human groups.</p>

The doctor argues that while many beneficiaries are already employed or should be exempt due to disability or other circumstances, the bureaucratic hurdles of proving eligibility will cause many to lose coverage. Using examples of patients who lack stable housing, identification, or internet access, the article illustrates how these administrative burdens, or "time tax," are nearly impossible for them to overcome.

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Advocates '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for better emotional regulation and a more fulfilled life. The concept, based on neuroscientific findings, suggests that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any prolonged negative feeling is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-running the upsetting thought. Gawdat advises allowing yourself that minute and a half to feel the emotion, and then making a conscious choice to shift your focus, thereby preventing rumination and recovering more quickly from life's daily frustrations.</p>

          <p>A convenience store owner in Durham, UK, who personally stopped a shoplifter from stealing a crate of beer, is criticizing the lack of legal consequences for the offender. After the shopkeeper, Andrew Board, apprehended the man, police dealt with the incident through a community resolution, which does not result in a criminal record. The thief was required to pay for the stolen goods and was banned from the store. Board argues that this approach fails to deter future crime and reflects a national problem where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses do not lead to charges, undermining efforts by business owners to combat theft.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's federal trial highlights the legal system's fundamental inability to properly address the complexities of intimate partner violence and coercive control. The author suggests that because existing domestic violence laws are often ill-equipped to handle such cases, prosecutors resorted to sex-trafficking charges, which were difficult to prove. The article contends that the trial is another example of how the system, media, and public opinion often fail to grasp the power dynamics inherent in abuse, allowing wealthy and powerful men to evade full accountability for their actions against women.</p>

Meanwhile, Russia continued its intensified aerial campaign, launching over 300 drones and decoys into Ukraine overnight, with the western Khmelnytskyi region being the primary target.

          <p>Fatalities from heart attacks have plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. between 1970 and 2022, marking a major public health victory. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of prevention and treatment advancements. The successful public health campaign against smoking, the development of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and widespread CPR training have significantly reduced the risk and incidence of heart attacks. For patients who do suffer a cardiac event, improved emergency response, portable defibrillators, and advanced hospital treatments like angioplasty have drastically increased survival rates, saving tens of millions of lives over the past five decades.</p>

The article notes the irony that, despite the American Revolution's rejection of monarchy, a recent poll suggests a surprising number of Americans, especially young people, would favor replacing the U.S. President with the British monarch.
