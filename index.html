          <p>Federal authorities are investigating a possible sighting of Travis Decker, a Washington state man wanted for the murder of his three young daughters, in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest. Decker has been a fugitive for over a month since the bodies of his children were discovered near his truck at a campground. The U.S. Marshals Service received a tip from a family who saw a man matching Decker's description over the holiday weekend. A reward of up to $20,000 is being offered for information that leads to his capture, as search efforts intensify in the remote forest area.</p>

          <p>Violent anti-government demonstrations across Kenya have led to at least 10 deaths and over 560 arrests, according to human rights and police reports. The protests, commemorating the historic "Saba Saba" demonstrations, saw citizens demanding President William Ruto's resignation over corruption, the high cost of living, and police brutality. Authorities responded by barricading roads in the capital, Nairobi, and deploying police, who used tear gas and allegedly live rounds to disperse crowds. The unrest marks an escalation of tensions following the recent death of a blogger in police custody and other incidents of violence.</p>

          <p>AI-focused cloud provider CoreWeave has agreed to acquire data center operator Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is expected to significantly expand CoreWeave's infrastructure, giving it ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity and eliminating future lease obligations. CoreWeave plans to evaluate whether to divest Core Scientific's existing cryptocurrency mining operations or convert them to support AI workloads. The acquisition, which follows a rejected offer last year, aims to enhance CoreWeave's competitive position against major cloud providers by lowering its capital costs and securing critical real estate.

Financial experts advise checking and improving one's credit score, as better credit leads to more favorable loan terms. It is also recommended to compare offers from multiple lenders, not just one's current mortgage provider, to establish a baseline of competitive rates. Finally, prospective borrowers should calculate potential repayment costs under various interest rate scenarios to ensure affordability, especially given the variable nature of HELOC rates.

          <p>Contrary to some claims, the new tax bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits but instead introduces a new temporary deduction. The legislation provides a 'bonus' deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below $75,000, or $12,000 for couples earning under $150,000. Policy experts note this provides some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax will see no change.

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Central Texas were caused by a convergence of geographical and meteorological factors that created a worst-case scenario. The region's topography, known as the Texas Hill Country, is naturally prone to rapid flooding as its soil does not easily absorb heavy rainfall. A weather system carrying moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry stalled over the area, dumping extreme amounts of rain in a short period. This deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming the area while many residents and campers were asleep.</p>

          <p>Actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger attended a naturalization ceremony at Mount Vernon on July 4th, where he delivered remarks to 100 new U.S. citizens. Schwarzenegger praised George Washington's example of leadership, particularly his decision to voluntarily relinquish power rather than seeking to retain it indefinitely. He drew a parallel between Washington's restraint and the ideals of civic stewardship that he believes are essential for the country. Reflecting on his own journey as an immigrant, Schwarzenegger expressed his profound honor at being asked to participate in the ceremony at the historic site.</p>

          <p>This article highlights two uplifting stories of generosity from viewers. In Wyoming, a man whose car was hit by a 16-year-old on an icy road initiated a fundraiser that collected nearly $14,000 to help the teen replace her totaled vehicle. In another instance, two young brothers from Washington, both accomplished chess players, chose to donate their tournament winnings to support a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis. These acts demonstrate how communities can rally to support individuals in need, turning unfortunate events into opportunities for profound kindness and hope.</p>

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that discussions about the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will persist. The statement follows President Trump's recent criticisms of the agency's performance and his suggestion of potentially 'weaning off' FEMA and transferring its responsibilities to the state level. Despite these discussions, Trump recently approved a major disaster declaration for Texas following catastrophic flooding, which opens up federal funding and assistance through the agency. Leavitt affirmed the president's commitment to providing Texas with the necessary aid during the crisis.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded its highest annual number of measles cases since 1992, with the tally surpassing 1,277 infections. A significant outbreak in west Texas is the primary driver of the surge, with the state confirming over 750 cases this year alone. Health experts warn that the official count likely underestimates the true scope of the epidemic. The rise in cases of the vaccine-preventable disease, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, is linked to falling vaccination rates in some communities and the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano erupted twice on Monday, spewing volcanic ash and gas up to 11 miles into the atmosphere. The powerful eruptions prompted authorities to maintain the highest alert level and expand the exclusion zone around the volcano on Flores island. The ashfall blanketed nearby villages and led to the cancellation of at least 24 international and domestic flights, primarily affecting routes to and from Bali. While no casualties have been reported, officials are warning residents about the potential for lava flows, especially with the possibility of heavy rain.</p>

          <p>An exhaustive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of a 'client list' or that Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed prominent associates. The two-page memo summarizing the findings also reaffirmed that Epstein's death in a federal jail in 2019 was a suicide, a conclusion supported by video evidence showing no one entered his cell area. This contradicts earlier public statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi about reviewing such a list. The memo aims to provide transparency and quell conspiracy theories surrounding the case, stating that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no public good.</p>

The app uses a Bluetooth mesh network, allowing nearby devices to communicate directly with each other in an encrypted, ephemeral manner. This decentralized model requires no phone numbers or central servers, aligning with Dorsey's long-standing advocacy for privacy and censorship-resistant technology. The app is designed to function even during internet shutdowns, similar to platforms used in protests, offering a resilient communication tool for off-grid scenarios.</p>
