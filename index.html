          <p>Design software company Figma saw its stock fall by 14% in after-hours trading following its first earnings report since its initial public offering. While revenue of $249.6 million slightly exceeded expectations and grew 41% year-over-year, the company's third-quarter revenue forecast, though higher than consensus, implies a slowdown in growth. The report also detailed Figma's recent acquisitions and investments in AI-powered tools, which have yet to be fully monetized as the company navigates market pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the potential for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) development bank to create an alternative financial system, reducing member states' vulnerability to US-led sanctions. China has pledged $1.4 billion in loans to SCO members, signaling a move towards greater financial independence for the bloc. This development is particularly crucial for Iran, which faces the potential reinstatement of UN sanctions and sees integration into SCO financial frameworks as vital for its economic survival. The move is framed as a strategic shift towards Eastern alliances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI has confirmed that bones discovered during a recent search operation in Washington state are not human, marking a new development in the manhunt for fugitive Travis Decker. Decker is accused of murdering his three young daughters—Paityn, 9; Evelyn, 8; and Olivia, 5—whose bodies were found in his truck in June. The extensive two-day search near Rock Island Campground involved nearly 100 personnel and covered approximately 250 acres. While the recovered bones were not human, officials noted that other "potential evidence" was found and is currently being analyzed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in the District of Columbia has issued a ruling in the government's antitrust case against Google, opting not to force the company to sell its Chrome web browser. While deeming Google a "monopolist," Judge Amit Mehta described a forced divestiture as "incredibly messy and highly risky." The decision, seen as a major victory for the tech giant, caused its parent company Alphabet's stock to rise by 9%. The ruling does impose other remedies, including requiring Google to share some search data with rivals to foster competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that the January 6th Capitol attack is being systematically reframed into a moment of triumph for its perpetrators, drawing parallels to the "New Lost Cause" narrative of the Confederacy. The author points to the Trump administration granting military honors to Ashli Babbitt, settling her family's wrongful-death lawsuit, and pardoning convicted rioters as evidence of this revisionism. The piece contends that these actions are not about rewriting historical facts but rather justifying the insurrection by force, insisting that the perpetrators were heroes.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing, specifically whole genome sequencing, can be used as evidence in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer. This landmark decision sets a new precedent for criminal cases in the state, allowing prosecutors to present evidence linking Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on victims' remains. The defense challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, with a final decision on that challenge expected later this month. The technology allows for DNA extraction from degraded samples previously considered unusable.</p>

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a remarkable 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-shortened T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a total of 154-4 from their 14 overs. Despite a strong effort from Surrey captain Sam Curran, who scored an unbeaten 69, the home side fell just short in their chase. The win secures Northamptonshire's first appearance at Finals Day since 2016, the year they last won the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Florida to End All Childhood Vaccine Mandates, Governor DeSantis Announces</h2>

          <p>Governor Ron DeSantis has announced that Florida will become the first state to phase out all mandatory childhood vaccinations for school attendance, a move sharply criticized by medical groups. State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo argued the policy change allows for personal freedom, likening mandates to an "immoral" intrusion on rights. Physician groups, however, warned the decision is dangerous and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and polio. The state also plans to create a "Make America Healthy Again" commission to promote "medical freedom" and challenge established medical orthodoxy.</p>

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office has announced that no criminal charges will be filed against the four police officers who fatally shot Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism. The decision stated that prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers' use of deadly force was unjustified. Officials noted the officers were responding to a 911 call about an intoxicated man with a knife and were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities. The family's attorney expressed deep disappointment, arguing the officers had a duty to de-escalate and retreat from the situation.</p>

After her initial 2010 conviction was overturned by a federal judge in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct, Stermer was retried in May 2025. Prosecutors argued she intentionally set the fire and ran him over, a narrative supported by her sons, while her daughters maintain her innocence.</p>

The strategy would aim to boost the chances of former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is also running as an independent.

          <p>Angela Rayner, Britain's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, has admitted to underpaying stamp duty on a flat she purchased in Hove. She stated that initial legal advice failed to account for complex trust provisions related to her family home in Greater Manchester, which meant she should have paid a higher tax rate for an additional property. While denying any intent to dodge taxes, she has contacted tax authorities to settle the amount owed and referred herself for investigation by the prime minister's standards adviser. The admission has led to calls from the opposition for her to be sacked.</p>

The bill would require lawmakers to sell existing stock holdings and imposes a 10% penalty on the value of any investment that violates the ban. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans' perception of the national economy remains negative, with ratings dipping slightly over the past month. Most respondents chose "uncertain" and "struggling" to describe the economy's current state, while only a third described it as "rebounding" or "expanding." Persistent concerns about rising prices are a primary driver of this sentiment, with two-thirds of Americans stating that prices are still increasing and expecting them to continue to do so.
