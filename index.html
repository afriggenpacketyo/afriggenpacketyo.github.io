          <p>A New York man, Shane Daley, has been charged with cyberstalking for leaving threatening and profane voicemails for Paulette Thompson, the widow of slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The messages were left just hours after her husband's murder in December, celebrating his death and calling him a "capitalist pig." Investigators linked Daley to the calls through his cellphone number, and he later admitted it was possible he made them while drinking. If convicted, Daley faces up to five years in prison for his actions, which authorities described as vicious and outrageous.</p>

          <p>A heated confrontation occurred at Cincinnati Bengals training camp after rookie first-round pick Shemar Stewart accidentally knocked quarterback Joe Burrow to the ground. While rushing during a drill, Stewart lost his footing and fell into Burrow, a violation of the unwritten rule to protect quarterbacks from contact in practice. Teammates, particularly offensive linemen, immediately took exception and a scuffle ensued. Center Ted Karras and guard Lucas Patrick later emphasized the need to protect the team's star player, calling the incident a lesson in being smarter on the field.</p>

          <p>Google is under significant pressure as a judge's decision on antitrust remedies looms, with the Department of Justice advocating for the divestiture of its Chrome browser. The situation is intensified by a public $34.5 billion bid for Chrome from Perplexity AI, highlighting the browser's immense value and strategic importance. This comes as Google navigates the costly transition to AI and increasing competition from services like ChatGPT. Analysts are valuing Google's various assets, such as YouTube and Waymo, in anticipation of a potential breakup, which some believe could unlock shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' inspector general has identified "severe" staffing shortages across all its hospitals, with the number of shortages increasing by 50% this fiscal year. The watchdog found that 94% of VA facilities face a severe shortage of doctors, and psychology was the most frequently reported clinical staffing shortage. This comes as the VA is undergoing a department-wide reduction of 30,000 workers, which the administration claims is focused on bureaucracy, not patient care. The VA's press secretary disputed the report's reliability, calling it subjective and unstandardized.</p>

While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S., its long-term path remains uncertain, with most models showing a turn toward the northwest and north.</p>

The extraditions reflect a determined effort by both nations to dismantle these violent organizations and prevent them from operating from within prisons.</p>

          <p>A decade after being the NFL's least valuable team, the Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, second only to the Dallas Cowboys, according to Sportico. This dramatic rise is attributed to their relocation from St. Louis to Los Angeles and the construction of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, a vision driven by owner Stan Kroenke. The valuation reflects the team's success in monetizing the venue for both sports and entertainment, establishing a strong fan base, and achieving on-field competitiveness. This makes the Rams the second Los Angeles sports franchise, alongside the Lakers, to surpass a $10 billion valuation.</p>

          <p>Researchers predict that global reindeer populations, including North American caribou, could decline substantially by the end of the century due to climate change. A study led by the University of Adelaide found that North American populations are most at risk, potentially falling by up to 80% by 2100 without major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. By analyzing ancient DNA and fossils, scientists determined that reindeer have struggled during past periods of rapid warming, but the future losses are expected to be even more severe. This decline could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and carbon storage in the Arctic.</p>

          <p>In a new docuseries, U.S. men's national team players Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, along with Pulisic's father, have strongly condemned criticism from former USMNT players working as pundits. Weah labeled the commentators "evil," while Pulisic felt they disrespected him and forgot his contributions following his decision to skip the Gold Cup due to fatigue. The criticism from figures like Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan came during a period of poor team performance. Pulisic's father attributed the negative commentary to jealousy, stating the pundits should examine their own national team records before "talking shit."</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave fell by 20% after the company reported a larger-than-expected quarterly loss of 27 cents per share. The poor results were announced just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more stock volatility as insiders become eligible to sell shares. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, beating forecasts, and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance. However, some analysts were disappointed by the guidance and a delay in capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and life-threatening Naegleria fowleri infection in a patient who is now being treated in an intensive care unit. The source is still under investigation, but the patient had been water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks days before falling ill. This "brain-eating amoeba" is common in warm freshwater, but infection is extremely rare and occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose, allowing the organism to reach the brain. Officials advise swimmers to reduce risk by holding their nose shut or using nose clips when in freshwater.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, while some of the market's largest tech stocks declined. This rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, which would lower borrowing costs and disproportionately benefit smaller companies. The move reflects a shift in market sentiment, as lower rates are seen as a catalyst for economically sensitive stocks. In contrast, the megacap-focused Magnificent 7 Index fell, indicating a potential short-term move away from big tech. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's public criticism of a Goldman Sachs report, a broad consensus of Wall Street economists agrees that increased tariffs will lead to higher consumer inflation. Experts at firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS predict that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, businesses will increasingly pass the cost of duties onto consumers. While no one forecasts runaway inflation, they anticipate a steady rise that could push the Fed's preferred inflation measure into the low- to mid-3% range. This potential inflation is not expected to deter the Fed from cutting rates, given a deteriorating labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

While some countries like Spain advocate for suspending the entire EU-Israel trade pact, internal divisions have prevented even this smaller step from being adopted.

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic takes White House advisor Stephen Miller's concerns about crime in Washington, D.C., and turns them on their head. It ironically agrees that he is surrounded by criminals, but points not to street crime, but to the actions of the administration he serves. The piece humorously lists various alleged and convicted wrongdoings by Trump administration officials and associates, from defying court orders to accepting foreign gifts and storing classified documents improperly. The author concludes with the dark punchline that the person who masterminded abductions without due process is Miller himself, staring back from the mirror.</p>

The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturns a lower court's injunction that had restored the funding. The majority opinion stated that the grant recipients challenging the freeze did not have a valid legal basis for the court to hear their claims.
