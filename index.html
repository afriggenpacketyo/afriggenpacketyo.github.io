          <p>England and Wales are at risk of a premature exit from the Euro 2025 football tournament after both lost their opening matches. If both teams lose their upcoming games against the Netherlands and France, respectively, they will be eliminated before their final group stage match against each other. Defending champions England, under manager Sarina Wiegman, face a crucial final-like game, having never lost consecutive matches under her leadership. Wales manager Rhian Wilkinson has urged her team to show pride against a formidable French side in what is their first major tournament appearance.</p>

          <p>Kenya is experiencing continued unrest and business closures following violent anti-government protests that resulted in multiple deaths and hundreds of arrests. Demonstrators, largely youth frustrated by economic hardship and corruption, are demanding the release of an arrested lawmaker and justice for a 12-year-old girl killed by a stray bullet. President William Ruto has issued stern warnings against unconstitutional attempts to change the government. Analysts criticize the government's response as authoritarian and warn that ignoring the public's widespread discontent could exacerbate the volatile situation.</p>

          <p>Television presenter Gregg Wallace is facing new claims from over 50 people regarding alleged misconduct, which he denies, following his dismissal from the BBC's MasterChef. The allegations, which include inappropriate sexual comments and touching, have prompted an independent inquiry by the show's production company. Prominent figures, including Baroness Helena Kennedy and the head of the Bectu union, have warned Wallace against dismissing the women's claims or "gaslighting" them. Wallace has defended himself on social media, stating an investigation cleared him of the most serious allegations and accusing the media of peddling gossip.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire raging on the outskirts of Marseille, France, has injured more than 110 people, including firefighters and police officers, and forced the evacuation of at least 400 residents. The blaze, which authorities believe was sparked by a car fire, spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions, covering approximately 700 hectares. While the fire is reportedly diminishing, it is not yet fully under control, with around 800 firefighters continuing to battle it. The incident caused the temporary closure of Marseille Provence airport, one of the busiest in France, leading to expected flight disruptions.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has refuted a report claiming it provided air defense systems to Iran following a recent truce in its conflict with Israel. A Middle East Eye report, citing an Arab official, alleged that China had sent the military equipment to Iran, receiving payment in oil shipments. In response, China's embassy in Israel issued a statement to a local newspaper asserting that Beijing "never exports weapons to countries engaged in warfare." The embassy emphasized China's strict controls on dual-use items and its firm opposition to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

          <p>This article examines the comparison between former President Trump's efforts to revoke birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen immigrants and policies of Nazi Germany. While the Nuremberg Laws stripped German Jews of their citizenship, Germany historically based citizenship on bloodline, not birthplace, unlike the U.S. The 14th Amendment in the U.S. established birthright citizenship to grant rights to formerly enslaved people. While critics label Trump's move as authoritarian, the practice of unrestricted birthright citizenship is less common among industrialized nations, with the U.S. and Canada being notable exceptions among major economies.</p>

          <h2>UK School Caterers Report Reducing Portions and Meat Due to Rising Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:08:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School food caterers in the UK are being forced to serve smaller portions, use cheaper ingredients, and include less meat in student lunches due to rising costs and inadequate government funding. The incoming chair of LACA, a school food organization, stated that a recent 3p increase in the funding rate per meal is insufficient to cover the actual cost, which is estimated to be about 80p higher. This financial pressure is making it increasingly difficult to meet national school food standards. The situation is worsening as the government expands eligibility for free school meals, which strains school budgets.</p>

          <p>Branded residences, high-end properties associated with luxury brands like Four Seasons or Ferrari, are a rapidly growing segment of the real estate market. These developments offer owners access to premium services such as concierge, housekeeping, and spa facilities, providing an assurance of quality and a hassle-free lifestyle. While the market is expanding globally, particularly in Miami and Dubai, buyers should be cautious. They are paying a premium for the brand and must understand the licensing agreement between the developer and the brand, as well as the ongoing service charges and potential rental restrictions.

          <p>Intelligence officials across Europe are warning that a Russian-led campaign of sabotage and disruption is escalating, with a rising risk of serious injury or death. Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, over 70 incidents have been documented, including a recent arson attack on a London warehouse storing supplies for Ukraine, for which three men were just convicted. Officials note a shift from simple vandalism to more violent acts like arson and bombings, often carried out by recruited young amateurs. Russia is reportedly using proxies and online channels to recruit for these deniable operations.</p>

          <p>China has completed a 1,856-kilometer "green great wall" in Inner Mongolia, a massive environmental project designed to control the spread of three major deserts. The green belt runs along the southern edges of the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts, which cover a combined area of nearly 95,000 square kilometers. The project utilizes techniques like straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant trees such as sacsaoul. This effort is a key part of China's broader strategy to build an effective ecological barrier and combat the advance of desertification.</p>

          <p>This article questions the reasons behind former President Donald Trump's recent shift in policy towards Ukraine, where he approved sending defensive weapons after weeks of rejecting such requests. In a cabinet meeting, Trump expressed that he was "not happy" with Vladimir Putin, signaling a potential fraying of their relationship. This U-turn comes as Trump also hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had just nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in Middle East diplomacy. The change in stance on Ukraine raises questions about the strategic calculations influencing his foreign policy decisions.</p>

          <p>According to a Fox News Digital report citing Justice Department sources, former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan are reportedly under criminal investigation. The probe is said to be related to their involvement in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The investigation into Brennan was reportedly initiated after a referral from former CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The report suggests the probe involves false statements allegedly made to Congress, signaling a significant development in the long-running political and legal fallout from the Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to significantly reduce the federal workforce. The court lifted a lower court's injunction that had temporarily blocked the cuts, which are being carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This ruling means that terminations of federal employees can proceed while the underlying legal challenges continue in lower courts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only justice to publicly dissent, warning that the executive action could lead to mass firings and the dismantling of government programs.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced opposition leader and former parliament speaker Rached Ghannouchi to 14 years in prison as part of a mass trial involving 21 individuals. Ghannouchi, leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, has been in custody since 2023 and now faces a total of 27 years from separate cases. The charges included participating in a terrorist-linked organization and attempting to overthrow the government, which his defense lawyers claim are based on false testimony. The sentencing is part of a broader crackdown on opposition figures by President Kais Saied, which critics say has undermined the country's democracy.</p>

The river rose with shocking speed, overwhelming cabins and tents.

          <p>Hydrologists with the National Weather Service recognized the conditions that could lead to the recent deadly flooding on the Guadalupe River, stating that historical data showed such an event was a known risk. The area, known as "Flash Flood Alley," has experienced major flooding over a dozen times in the past century, including similar deadly events. Experts issued a flash flood watch hours before the water surged, but the difficulty lies in pinpointing heavy rainfall and ensuring overnight warnings reach sleeping residents.
