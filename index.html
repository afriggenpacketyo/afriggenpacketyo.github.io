          <p>William Duplessie, a second suspect, has been arrested in connection with the alleged kidnapping and torture of an Italian tourist in Manhattan, who was held captive for nearly three weeks in an attempt to steal his cryptocurrency. The victim reported being hung off a roof ledge, shocked with electrical wires, and threatened with a chainsaw until he revealed his Bitcoin wallet password. Duplessie is charged with kidnapping, assault, and unlawful imprisonment, mirroring the charges against his alleged accomplice, John Woeltz, a crypto investor from Kentucky who rented the SoHo home where the assaults occurred. Police found Polaroid photos of the victim tied up and tortured, along with firearms and drugs, during a search of the luxury home.</p>

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI technology at some self-checkouts, leading to customer jokes and complaints about increased surveillance. Overhead cameras identify when shoppers fail to scan an item properly, showing a live-action replay of the failed scan. The move aims to reduce shoplifting, which has hit a record high in the UK, with recorded offences rising 20% last year. While some shoppers mocked the tech, others voiced concerns about potential privacy intrusions and vowed to avoid self-checkouts altogether.</p>

          <p>Timothy Schulz, 42, died after being shot by sheriff's deputies in Lakeland, Florida, following a bizarre series of events that began with an alligator bite. According to authorities, Schulz swam across a lake known to have alligators, was bitten, and then entered a gated community carrying garden shears. Deputies say Schulz charged at them with the shears and attempted to grab a firearm from their cruiser, leading to the shooting. Schulz had a lengthy criminal history involving methamphetamine arrests, and toxicology reports are pending to determine if substances influenced his behavior.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage from CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and rising competition. While overall battery electric car sales rose, Tesla's brand value has declined due to Musk's political activities, including endorsing a far-right party in Germany. The company faces increasing competition from traditional automakers and Chinese players like BYD, which recently outsold Tesla in Europe for pure electric cars. European consumers also show a preference for hybrid vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve.</p>

Shipping companies, many based in China, are offering ways to avoid tariffs by altering shipment information or transshipping goods through countries with lower tariff rates. Honest companies that pay tariffs are frustrated and worried about being at a financial disadvantage to dishonest competitors. The Trump administration said it would focus more on fighting trade fraud, including tariff evasion, but many American companies say the scale of illicit activity now far outweighs the ability of these governments to thwart it.</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, while crews are also battling fires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Firefighters have made significant progress, with all Minnesota evacuations lifted on Memorial Day. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota fires cover approximately 30,000 acres. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was 'human caused,' though the investigation is still ongoing. Donations are being accepted to support relief for affected community members in Lake and St. Louis Counties.</p>

Hardin, 56, had been incarcerated since 2017 and is considered armed and dangerous, prompting multiple agencies to join the search. Hardin was convicted of fatally shooting James Appleton and later pleaded guilty to the 1997 sexual assault of Amy Harrison. The mayor of Gateway, Arkansas, expressed concerns about the escape, fearing Hardin may target her and her family.</p>

          <p>Rep. Judy Chu and advocacy groups are pressing FEMA to provide more housing assistance to victims of the Eaton Fires, noting that many remain in unstable living situations despite available federal vouchers. Chu is urging FEMA to authorize a Direct Lease program, where the agency directly rents apartments for disaster survivors. The push for additional housing aid comes amid widespread cuts to FEMA and resistance from the Trump administration for disaster spending nationwide. FEMA maintains that thousands of rental units are available across L.A. County, making the Direct Lease program unnecessary, but advocates argue that this data doesn't reflect the reality on the ground.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights a record surge in homelessness among late baby boomers, attributing it to the loss of parental aid.

Factors such as recessions, soaring rents, and addiction have also contributed to the high rates of homelessness among this group.

The rise in unemployment is attributed to a mismatch between the supply of graduates and the demand for labor, particularly in the tech industry, with automation and artificial intelligence potentially impacting lower-level computer science positions.
