        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic demand and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, slightly better than market expectations. This decline underscores the challenges Beijing faces in stimulating consumption and stabilizing prices, with analysts pointing to price wars in sectors like automotive and falling property prices as contributing factors. Chinese policymakers are urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures to boost consumption as export growth slows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning a trip to the United States to continue ministerial-level talks aimed at securing concessions on tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump.

          <p>China has started mass production of the world’s first non-binary AI chip, a breakthrough led by Professor Li Hongge’s team at Beihang University. This chip merges binary and stochastic logic, enabling unprecedented fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications. It overcomes challenges in traditional computing and sidesteps US chip restrictions. The new Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's decision to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, comparing his actions to those of a "dictator."

The governor has demanded that Trump rescind the order and accuses him of abusing his power. Other Democratic governors have also joined in condemning the deployment.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in conflict over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, with differing interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. The Act generally bars the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist. Trump deployed the National Guard after ICE agents were reportedly attacked, while Newsom argues the deployment is unlawful and inflames tensions. The dispute centers on the balance between federal authority and state sovereignty in maintaining law and order.</p>

          <p>China's producer deflation deepened in May to its worst level in almost two years, while consumer prices continued to decline, as the economy faces trade tensions and a prolonged housing downturn. The producer price index fell 3.3% year-on-year, the deepest contraction in 22 months. Uncertainties from a tariff war with the United States and weak consumption have fueled expectations of more policy stimulus to combat deflationary pressures. The consumer price index dipped 0.1% last month from a year earlier. (not investment advice)</p>
