          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of measures, including interest rate cuts and reduced reserve requirements for banks, to mitigate the impact of the trade war with the United States.

This article reports that these policies are intended to stabilize markets amidst global economic uncertainties and trade tensions, though some analysts believe the impact may be modest due to potentially weak demand from borrowers.

          <p>A 14-year-old from Essex, named Finley, suffers from an extremely rare digestive condition that prevents him from eating any food due to his body's inability to tolerate lipids. Since the age of four, Finley has received weekly lipid infusions directly into his heart, bypassing his digestive system entirely. His case is so unique that doctors are considering presenting it to a medical journal, as he may be the only person whose body reacts to lipids in this manner.
