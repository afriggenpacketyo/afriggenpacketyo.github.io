          <p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced charges against several individuals involved in recent immigration protests, citing instances of assault on peace officers, resisting arrest, commercial burglary, and vandalism. Juan Rodriguez faces charges for allegedly throwing fireworks at police, while Randy Ruiz and Georgina Ravallaro are accused of driving motorcycles into officers. Timmy Paulk and Raven Mitchell are charged with robbing a Nike store, and Ulysses Sanchez faces charges for reckless driving and firearm possession. Christopher Gonzalez and Jocelyn Johnson are accused of vandalizing property, with Hochman emphasizing that violent acts during protests will not be tolerated, though he acknowledged that most protests have been peaceful. The article underscores the DA's commitment to prosecuting those who engage in criminal activities under the guise of protest, while respecting the rights of peaceful demonstrators.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled, leading to irreparable harm. While the administration could still attempt to deport Khalil for other reasons, such as alleged omissions on his green card application, the judge determined that the current detention is primarily due to Rubio's determination, thus the judge ordered the detainment to cease. The article highlights the ongoing legal battle and the administration's efforts to deport international students involved in pro-Palestinian campus activism.

          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a significant increase of over 4% due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, fueled by President Trump's growing doubt about reaching a nuclear deal. The U.S. is reportedly preparing to evacuate non-essential personnel from its embassy in Baghdad, while the UK Maritime Trade Operations warned of potential military escalation in the region. Trump expressed diminished confidence in striking a deal with Iran, emphasizing that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon, preferably without warfare.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump of a "brazen abuse of power" in a televised address, criticizing the administration's immigration enforcement efforts as terrorizing immigrant neighborhoods. Newsom warned that democracy is under assault and that California may be the first target but will not be the last.
