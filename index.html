          <p>Carvana reported record first-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street expectations with a 46% increase in year-over-year sales, reaching nearly 134,000 units. The online used vehicle retailer's revenue soared to $4.23 billion, a 38% increase from the previous year, and it also achieved record net income of $373 million. CEO Ernie Garcia addressed potential tariff impacts, downplaying significant effects on the business. The company anticipates that changes in new vehicle prices could positively influence used car sales, but the overall net effect remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that the U.S. is nearing trade agreements, potentially announcing a "major trade deal" with the United Kingdom, which could be the first of several agreements with countries like Canada, Italy, India, and Japan. Negotiations are ongoing as businesses and investors seek clarity amid existing tariffs, including a 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods and high tariffs on Chinese imports. Experts suggest that while some countries may quickly comply with U.S. demands, comprehensive deals could take longer to finalize due to long-term implications.</p>

          <p>Following the death of international relations scholar Joseph Nye, known for the concept of "soft power," Chinese scholars have expressed cautious views on his intellectual legacy. While Nye's idea of soft power was widely praised and adopted in China, scholars suggest his policy influence was limited, and his attitude towards China wasn't as friendly as some believed. Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have emphasized soft power, incorporating values and culture to influence others and gain consent, in contrast to hard power.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the New York City helicopter crash that killed five family members and the pilot indicates the aircraft broke apart midair. Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs before the helicopter separated into three major sections, with the tail boom possibly struck by the main rotor blades. The NTSB is conducting a forensic examination to determine the initial cause of the break-up, focusing on potential mechanical issues or pilot error. The tour operator, New York Helicopter, is cooperating with authorities amidst scrutiny of sightseeing tours around Manhattan.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including Tom Brady and Stephen Curry. The judge ruled that plaintiffs failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the platform. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in 2022, which resulted in billions of dollars in losses for customers. The ruling narrows the scope of the multidistrict litigation accusing the celebrities of promoting a fraudulent platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study reveals that climate change significantly worsened the deadly storms in the Midwest and South in early April, increasing the intensity of record-breaking downpours by about 9%. The storms, which killed at least 24 people, were fueled by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change. Researchers also express concern about ongoing staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which could impact the issuance of timely warnings. The study predicts that extreme weather events will become more common and intense without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady due to economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump called Powell a "fool" and expressed frustration with the decision, arguing that low inflation and tariff revenue warranted lower rates. Powell stated that the Fed's decisions would not be influenced by Trump's criticisms and would focus on maximizing employment and maintaining price stability. Trump's previous comments about potentially firing Powell had troubled markets, but he later stated he had "no intention" of doing so.</p>

          <p>Britain is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, which could ease the impact of recent U.S. tariff increases and boost consumer and business confidence. While the deal is expected to support sectors like the auto industry, its overall impact on the British economy may be limited due to the significant trade in services. The Bank of England cut interest rates amid trade uncertainty, but economists suggest that global trade uncertainty poses a greater threat to Britain than tariffs alone.

          <p>Despite diplomatic efforts by the United States and other regional players, tensions between India and Pakistan remain high following recent military actions. Overnight shelling and strikes have been reported on both sides, with each country making claims of downing aircraft and drones. While both sides have expressed openness to de-escalation, the situation on the ground remains volatile, with the United States issuing an alert to its citizens in Lahore. The conflict stems from a terror attack in Kashmir and long-standing disputes over the region.</p>
