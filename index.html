          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent phone call between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump may provide some relief for Asian countries caught between the two superpowers. The conversation is considered a diplomatic achievement after weeks of escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. However, despite this detente, the analysts also suggest that the relationship between the two countries remains fragile, making it difficult for China's neighbors to balance their relationships with both nations. The phone call marks a tentative step back from the brink, but the long-term impact remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as China's leading hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai due to its access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets. Despite the presence of mainland exchanges in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, companies are increasingly opting for Hong Kong's stock exchange to raise capital. This trend has accelerated since the summer of 2024, with several mainland companies choosing Hong Kong for their capital infusions. Hong Kong's appeal lies in its ability to attract international investors and facilitate global business operations, giving it an edge over mainland exchanges. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy due to escalating public grievances over soaring rice prices and an upcoming national election. Rice prices have roughly doubled from the previous year, leading Ishiba to consider overhauling the decades-old production adjustment system. He aims to boost rice production and counter opposition parties advocating for a consumption tax cut. While Japan officially ended its acreage reduction policy in 2018, production adjustments have continued to protect farmers, presenting challenges to Ishiba's reform efforts. </p>
