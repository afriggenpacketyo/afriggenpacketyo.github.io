          <p>ABC has indefinitely pre-empted "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks about the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair also pulled the show, citing the comments as offensive and not in the public interest. The move has drawn reactions from across the political spectrum, including from former President Trump and the FCC Chairman, sparking a national debate on broadcast standards and political discourse.</p>

While campus police have stated they see no evidence of foul play, the student's family has hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump and is demanding a thorough investigation. The case has evoked the state's history of racial violence and caused significant distress among students, prompting calls for the FBI to intervene.</p>

The lawsuit stems from Owens' repeated promotion of a conspiracy theory that Mrs. Macron was born male. Their lawyer stated that the claims have been incredibly upsetting and that Mrs. Macron is resolved to take the necessary steps, however unpleasant, to set the record straight and counter the disinformation.</p>

          <p>Edward Enninful, the former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, has expressed concern that the fashion industry risks regressing on diversity amid a cultural "anti-woke" movement. He noted a potential return to a narrow beauty standard where being super-thin and European is considered the norm. Enninful, who recently launched a new inclusive media platform, emphasized that celebrating diversity in body shape or ethnicity is not "woke" but a reflection of the real world, and the industry must decide what it stands for.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Plan to Designate Antifa as a 'Major Terrorist Organization'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has declared his intention to designate the decentralized anti-fascist movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a social media post, Trump called the movement a "SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER" and said he would recommend an investigation into its funders. This move would face legal and practical challenges, as U.S. law does not have a formal designation for domestic terrorist organizations, and previous FBI directors have described antifa as an ideology rather than a structured group.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has formed a coalition with over 40 conservative organizations, including the America First Policy Institute and Turning Point USA, to create "patriotic" civics education programming. The initiative, called the America 250 Civics Education Coalition, aims to renew patriotism and promote understanding of America's founding principles in schools ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. This partnership comes as the Trump administration works to reduce the federal role in education and return control over curriculum to the states.</p>
