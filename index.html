          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its financial forecast for the year, citing increased sales to home improvement professionals as a buffer against weaker demand from do-it-yourself customers, with CEO Marvin Ellison highlighting investments in stores, technology, and customer service as key factors in navigating market challenges. The company's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, although sales fell slightly short of Wall Street projections, and while weather impacted sales, online sales and professional sales experienced growth. Lowe's is also strategically acquiring companies like Artisan Design Group to further boost its appeal to professional clients, mirroring Home Depot's efforts to attract this demographic to offset slower sales from individual consumers.</p>

          <p>Chris Brown, the US singer, has been released on bail by a London court after being charged with grievous bodily harm related to an alleged "unprovoked attack" at a nightclub in 2023, and the judge required him to pay a Â£5 million security fee. The Grammy-winning artist, who has not yet entered a plea, is now free to proceed with his planned world tour next month as part of his bail conditions.

          <p>Patrons of the Boston bar that inspired the sitcom 'Cheers' are mourning the death of George Wendt, the actor who played Norm, a beloved regular at the bar. The bar, formerly known as the Bull & Finch Pub, became a gathering spot for fans to pay their respects, with many toasting to Wendt's memory. Joyce Kulhawik, a WBZ-TV entertainment anchor, recalled Wendt's laid-back and warm personality, noting his resemblance to the character he portrayed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK health officials have confirmed the first-ever detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, with the UK Health Security Agency stating the risk to the public is "very low" and that there is no evidence of spread. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023, and health officials emphasize that the detection was not unexpected given the virus's prevalence in Europe. Experts suggest climate change is a contributing factor, potentially introducing non-native mosquito species and infectious diseases to the UK, so authorities are monitoring the situation. While most infections result in minor or no symptoms, a small percentage of infected individuals may experience severe illness, though no specific treatments or vaccines are available for humans.</p>

Concerns about increased U.S. duties on Canadian lumber imports, which currently stand at 14.5%, are exacerbating the issue, with potential increases to 34.5% disrupting the sector, and the Trump administration is considering tightening trade restrictions.

          <p>Justice Department officials have charged members of an Armenian organized crime ring with stealing over $83 million in cargo from Amazon by posing as legitimate truck drivers, and the scheme involved diverting truckloads of merchandise, including smart TVs and appliances, from designated routes. The fraudsters allegedly operated transport carriers and used the Amazon Relay app to obtain contracted freight routes, reselling the stolen goods or gifting them to associates, with Amazon cooperating in the investigation. The DOJ linked the defendants to other alleged crimes, such as attempted murder and kidnapping, and cargo theft-related losses are estimated to be close to $1 billion or more a year for retailers.</p>

Cuomo, who is now running for mayor of New York City, faces scrutiny over a March 2020 directive that initially barred nursing homes from refusing patients who tested positive for COVID-19, and the report by the New York state comptroller found that Cuomo's Health Department underreported nursing home deaths by as much as 50%.

Bedard emphasizes the importance of forthright information and planning for the worst, rather than denial, particularly for individuals in positions of power and responsibility, and she suggests that political leaders have an obligation to face the realities of aging and plan accordingly.</p>

The B61-12 air-launched tactical thermonuclear bombs, carried by the B-52, are seen as enhancing lethality through blast waves, radiation penetration, and radioactive contamination, significantly amplifying their destructive power, according to the researchers.</p>

          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to support a comprehensive bill aimed at advancing his domestic agenda, as party leaders negotiated with holdouts to secure enough votes for passage. Trump urged Republicans to drop their reservations and support the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, emphasizing loyalty to him and warning against dissent, and the bill includes extensions to the 2017 tax cuts, increased military and immigration enforcement spending, and cuts to Medicaid and other programs. Negotiations continued behind the scenes as Speaker Mike Johnson worked to address concerns from various Republican factions, and the House Rules Committee debated the measure late into the night to prepare it for a final vote.</p>

          <p>Despite growing resistance from women, it is unlikely that the Iranian government will reverse its stance on the public hijab rule, and even conservative politicians acknowledge the state's policy is not to follow strict rules. A gender researcher from Tehran noted that women are increasingly choosing not to wear the hijab in public, and the protests following the death of Jina Mahsa Amini have led to significant changes. However, women who engage with international media risk being accused of "propaganda against the system," and women's rights activist Sedigheh Vasmaghi emphasized that the political system has not accepted the resistance shown by women, but lacks the power to stop or reverse this change.</p>
