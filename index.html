          <p>As investors return from summer holidays, they face September, which has historically been the weakest month for major stock indices like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq. Despite record highs in August, concerns about a potential economic slowdown are mounting, with some economists viewing recent robust growth figures as misleading. Key economic data, including EU inflation and U.S. non-farm payrolls, will be closely watched this week to gauge the health of the global economy. Market outlooks are mixed, with some experts anticipating a soft landing while others remain cautious about underlying pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

She began making money as a child by trading Pokémon cards and later developed coding skills to create and sell bots for online games. After dropping out of Carnegie Mellon to accept a Thiel Fellowship, she co-founded Scale AI, which was later acquired by Meta for $25 billion. Guo is now the founder of the monetization platform Passes, though the company is currently facing a class-action lawsuit which it denies.</p>

          <p>New data from England's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between student absences in the first week of the school year and persistent absenteeism later on. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 went on to be "persistently absent," compared to just 14% of those with perfect attendance that week. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize attendance from day one to combat what she calls "critically high" absence levels that have persisted since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

The gathering of the regional security bloc, which was founded as a counterweight to Western alliances, is taking place as both India and Russia face economic pressure from the United States. Modi is holding his first talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in seven years, a significant development as the U.S. has imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods over its continued purchases of Russian oil.

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best she has ever made, citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical health. After a demanding season where she captained Chelsea to a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give 100% to the national team. The 32-year-old, who has since undergone knee surgery and started counseling, says she felt she had "lost herself" while balancing leadership duties.

          <p>This opinion article draws parallels between the Trump administration's confrontational approach to the press and recent actions by the UK's Reform party. It highlights the Reform-led Nottinghamshire council's decision to ban the Nottingham Post and affiliated BBC reporters, likening it to the White House restricting access for outlets like the Associated Press. The author argues that hard-right politicians on both sides of the Atlantic increasingly see a benefit in turning the media into a foil, believing they can bypass traditional outlets without electoral consequences. However, the piece also notes that such tactics may backfire by raising questions about a party's fitness to govern.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee who led the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), is stepping down after a four-month tenure, declaring his mission "accomplished." The MCC, a U.S. foreign aid agency created in 2004, provides infrastructure grants to developing nations. Dasgupta's role was to reposition the agency from a traditional aid provider to a strategic investment tool aligned with the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, focusing on U.S. return on investment and countering Chinese influence. His departure comes as the administration seeks to reframe global engagement, preserving the MCC as a leaner, investment-driven entity while cutting other aid programs.</p>

          <p>After a preseason marked by tightly controlled media access, UCLA's football team was decisively beaten 43-10 by Utah in their season opener at the Rose Bowl. The Bruins' defense struggled significantly, missing numerous tackles and allowing Utah quarterback Devon Dampier to dominate both through the air and on the ground. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a difficult debut, completing only half his passes for one touchdown and one interception, while the running game failed to gain traction. The lopsided defeat raises serious questions about the team's capabilities after a promising end to the previous season under coach DeShaun Foster.</p>

Operating near the California-Oregon border, the researchers blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and dialogue from the film "Marriage Story" to haze the predators and interrupt hunts, particularly at night. This creative approach is part of an ongoing effort to find ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist, as conflicts increase. While the technology is expensive and has limitations, early results have been successful in scaring wolves away without harming them.</p>

Both nations are currently facing significant economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, creating a shared incentive to improve their strained relationship. While deep-seated issues like border disputes and regional rivalries remain, the immediate economic challenges may be pushing them toward greater cooperation. Experts suggest that even small steps, such as resuming direct flights and easing visa restrictions, could signal a thaw and send a clear message to Washington that both countries have other strategic options.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights in anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to prevent city police from being deputized by federal authorities and prohibits them from participating in federal actions that violate residents' rights. It also calls for federal agents operating in the city to be clearly identifiable and not wear masks, a common practice in recent immigration crackdowns. The move comes amid what the mayor calls "highly credible reports" of impending federal action, drawing parallels to similar controversial deployments in other cities.</p>

          <p>This article details the case of Dino Guglielmelli, a millionaire vitamin supplement entrepreneur who was convicted of attempting to hire a hit man to murder his wife, Monica Olsen, during their contentious divorce. Guglielmelli asked his business associate, Rick Fuhrmann, to carry out the killing for $80,000, expressing that his children would be "better off without her." Fuhrmann, however, went to the police and agreed to wear a wire, capturing Guglielmelli confirming the plot on tape. Guglielmelli ultimately pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted murder and was sentenced to nine years in prison.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, an FCS opponent. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime, while the offense never punted and averaged over 10 yards per play. The defense also showed significant improvement from last season, recording five sacks and scoring a touchdown on an interception by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the lopsided win provided a smooth start, the quality of the opponent makes it difficult to gauge the team's true strength.</p>

          <p>This commentary article reflects on the case of Alix Tichelman, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the 2013 heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. The author questions the distribution of blame, suggesting that if the roles were reversed, Hayes, as a powerful executive, might not have faced the same legal consequences. The piece notes that Hayes arranged the meeting, asked for the drugs, and participated consensually in the act that led to his death. It concludes that while Tichelman was legally responsible for not calling for help, the ethical questions of accountability are more complex.</p>

          <p>This article investigates the 2013 death of Forrest Hayes, a 51-year-old Google executive found dead from a heroin overdose on his yacht in Santa Cruz. The investigation revealed Hayes had met with Alix Tichelman, a 26-year-old woman he contacted through a "sugar daddy" website. Security footage from the yacht, which was crucial to the case, showed Tichelman injecting Hayes with heroin at his request. After he went into distress, she made no attempt to call for help, instead gathering her belongings and wiping down surfaces before leaving. Tichelman was later arrested in a police sting and pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States reported significant service outages on Saturday, with many phones being relegated to "SOS mode," which only allows for emergency calls. The issues, which began shortly after noon Eastern Time, were attributed by the company to a "software issue." According to the tracking site DownDetector, outage reports peaked in the mid-afternoon with nearly 23,000 complaints from coast to coast. Verizon acknowledged the problem, stating that its engineers were working on a solution and that service was beginning to be restored in some affected areas by the evening.</p>

          <p>Despite recent polls showing a rise in its public favorability, Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is facing internal anxiety over its future leadership. With current chairman Eric Chu Li-luan set to step down in October, the party is struggling to identify a successor for what some consider a challenging role. A recent poll from My Formosa indicated the KMT's favorability has edged past that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). This presents a political opportunity for the KMT, but uncertainty about who will take charge is creating a sense of unease within the party.</p>
