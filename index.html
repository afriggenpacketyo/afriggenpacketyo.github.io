          <p>A new Chinese company, AMIES Technology, has been established to accelerate the country's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductor manufacturing and reduce its reliance on Dutch giant ASML. As a spin-off from the state-owned Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), AMIES aims to commercialize lithography equipment more quickly, addressing a critical bottleneck created by U.S. export controls that block China from acquiring advanced chipmaking systems. The company's emergence signals renewed optimism in China's domestic push to overcome technological sanctions in the high-stakes global chip war.</p>

In a social media post, Santos detailed a personal phone call with Trump and expressed gratitude for a "second chance," stating his intent to now focus on prison reform. Trump justified the commutation by claiming Santos had been mistreated and praised his consistent Republican voting record during his brief time in Congress.</p>

The incident dealt a significant blow to McLaren's championship aspirations, allowing Verstappen to gain valuable points on his rivals. McLaren team boss Zak Brown had earlier predicted a "brutal" end to the season, a sentiment underscored by the costly crash between his two drivers at the Circuit of the Americas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on credible intelligence that the terrorist group Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip. This action would constitute a severe violation of the recently brokered ceasefire agreement. The U.S. has informed the guarantor nations of the peace deal and stated that protective measures would be taken if Hamas proceeds with the attack. The warning comes after a video surfaced showing Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel.</p>

          <p>Hamas has handed over the remains of two more individuals to Israeli authorities via the Red Cross, who are believed to be hostages taken from the Gaza Strip. The bodies are being transported to Israel's National Center of Forensic Medicine for formal identification. This transfer is part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement that stipulated the return of all living hostages and the remains of deceased ones in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The process has been tense, with delays in returning all deceased hostages causing friction in the fragile peace deal.</p>

Instead of helping them, the company used high-pressure sales tactics to sell them useless fake "credits," funding a lavish lifestyle for its owners while leaving victims out of pocket and still trapped in their expensive contracts.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the United States Grand Prix in Austin, outpacing McLaren's Lando Norris by nearly three-tenths of a second. Verstappen's dominant performance was achieved even without a final qualifying lap, as his team sent him out too late. Norris secured a front-row start by narrowly beating Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, while his teammate and championship leader Oscar Piastri struggled, qualifying in a disappointing sixth place, further opening the door for Verstappen in the drivers' championship battle.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has given up his royal titles and will be largely absent from public life following intense public and internal pressure over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While the move is a significant blow to his reputation, its practical impact on his daily life may be limited, as he remains a prince and continues to reside at Royal Lodge in Windsor. The decision, reportedly influenced by King Charles and Prince William, is seen as an attempt by Buckingham Palace to draw a line under the scandal.</p>

          <p>The Indonesian island of Lombok, long known as a laidback alternative to its bustling neighbor Bali, is undergoing rapid development as the government aims to create another major tourist hub. This "Bali-fication" has brought economic opportunities for locals but has also led to forced evictions, environmental strain, and concerns over the loss of local culture. While some residents have prospered by opening businesses, others have been displaced by large-scale projects like a new racetrack, creating a complex dynamic of progress and loss.</p>

The strike, which killed two other individuals on board, is the latest in a series of attacks targeting alleged narcotics trafficking in the region. The survivors, from Ecuador and Colombia, were rescued by a U.S. military helicopter and will be returned to their home countries for prosecution, according to Trump, who has defended the strikes as necessary to stop the flow of drugs.</p>

          <p>John Sandweg, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has criticized the Trump administration for putting federal agents "in a terrible position" by deploying specialized Border Patrol units in urban environments like Chicago. Sandweg argues that these agents, trained for high-risk border operations, are not suited for city crowd control, leading to escalated confrontations with protesters. His comments come as a federal judge ordered agents in Chicago to wear body cameras following incidents of forceful tactics against civilians and journalists.</p>
