          <p>Japan's farm minister announced that consumers can purchase government-released reserve rice at smaller supermarkets for around $12 per 5 kilograms starting in early June. This initiative aims to counteract a surge in rice prices, which the state is actively trying to reverse. The ministry plans to resume accepting purchase requests specifically from small supermarkets and rice shops to ensure widespread distribution. This decision follows a halt in orders from major retailers due to high demand, reflecting the government's strategy to stabilize rice prices for consumers. Optimism score of 70.</p>

          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has secured the second-most seats in parliament, positioning it as the main opposition to the new government, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. This accomplishment follows Chega's recent gains in the May 18 election, aligning with a broader surge of far-right forces across Europe. Led by Andre Ventura, Chega has capitalized on a hardline stance against immigration and the inability of traditional parties to form lasting governments. The party's success underscores a profound change in the Portuguese political system, challenging the established pattern of center-right and center-left parties alternating in power.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10 percent year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential U.S. tariff increases on imported cars. The company's global production also rose, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of a 25 percent tariff on cars produced outside the United States, Toyota plans to absorb the costs without passing them on to consumers, though analysts anticipate long-term pressure to do so.

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. announced that it has begun soliciting early retirement applications in the United States as part of its efforts to turn around its struggling business. The program is part of the company's streamlining efforts, which include cutting 20,000 jobs and closing seven vehicle plants globally. Nissan aims to reduce its workforce in the U.S. market, where it has been grappling with poor sales. Domestically, Nissan will also solicit early retirement applications from administrative staff this summer. Optimism score of 40.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing challenges like high labor costs and water restrictions, California avocado growers report that Mexican imports have actually helped their sales. The lifting of the U.S. ban on Mexican avocados in 1997 has allowed for a year-round supply, fostering demand and transforming avocados from specialty items to regular offerings. Increased consumption has been buoyed by growing interest in healthy fats and marketing efforts by the Hass Avocado Board. California growers want Mexican avocados to keep flowing into the country, though they also want robust U.S. inspections of the imports to keep out pests. Optimism score of 80.</p>
