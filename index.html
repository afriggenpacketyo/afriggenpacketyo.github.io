          <p>During the sentencing hearing for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, Judge Arun Subramanian stated that he does not believe the music mogul is taking full responsibility or has shown remorse for his prostitution-related convictions. The judge indicated he would consider conduct for which Combs was acquitted, such as testimony related to sex trafficking charges, as relevant context to demonstrate the force and coercion used in the crimes. In a letter to the court, Combs apologized for his actions and claimed he had been reformed while in prison, though prosecutors argued the defense was trying to downplay the victims' voices.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Daniel Walker of the Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester described witnessing "evil" as an attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, tried to force his way into the building during Yom Kippur services. He recounted how he and other worshippers held the doors shut while the assailant used his body and heavy plant pots to try and break in. The rabbi praised the "genuine heroism" of those who ran to help instead of fleeing, stating their quick actions prevented a much larger tragedy, as hundreds more people were expected to arrive for the service.</p>

By integrating with Walmart's massive retail footprint, OnePay aims to appeal to a broad population of Americans underserved by traditional banks and leverage its significant distribution channel.

          <p>As the U.S. hiring market slows, a growing number of Americans are experiencing long-term unemployment, with some searching for work for nearly a year. The share of individuals unemployed for 27 weeks or more has risen to its highest level in over three years, affecting both experienced professionals and recent graduates. Personal accounts reveal the financial and emotional strain of the prolonged job hunt, as workers deplete savings and face hundreds of rejections in what economists describe as a "low-hire, low-fire environment."</p>

          <p>An article analyzes Donald Trump's recent speech to top military commanders at Quantico, noting that it combined partisan campaign rhetoric with directives, including the potential deployment of the military in major U.S. cities. The address, delivered alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, railed against diversity and inclusion policies while asserting presidential authority over the armed forces. While some insiders were relieved that no immediate purge of generals occurred, the event has intensified concerns about the ongoing politicization of what is traditionally a non-partisan institution.</p>

          <p>Fire crews successfully contained a large fire that erupted following an explosion at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo, California. No injuries were reported from the incident at the facility, which is the largest producing oil refinery on the U.S. West Coast. Authorities advised residents in the surrounding areas, located near Los Angeles International Airport, to remain indoors as a precaution against potential air quality issues, though air quality monitors had not yet detected elevated levels of toxins. The fire did not impact airport operations.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has urged his followers on the X platform to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, joining a conservative backlash against the streaming service.

Musk's posts amplified accusations that Netflix is promoting a "transgender woke agenda" and criticism of the show's creator. Despite the high-profile call for a boycott, financial analysts believe it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Netflix's subscriber numbers or stock performance.</p>

This shift is presented as a significant cultural statement, particularly in a climate that can be critical of overt female ambition, showing she is done pretending she doesn't enjoy her hard-won success.</p>

This development comes after Comac had previously announced ambitious goals to increase its manufacturing capacity by 50% in 2025, a target that now appears uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Phil Rosenthal, the creator of the sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond" and star of the food and travel show "Somebody Feed Phil," is opening a new diner in Los Angeles. The restaurant, named "Max and Helen's" in honor of his late parents, will focus on classic comfort food, including his father's favorite dish, fluffy scrambled eggs. Rosenthal hopes the diner will serve as a community hub, helping to preserve the neighborhood feel that he believes is disappearing from American life.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing federal government shutdown, the Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in funding designated for two major public transit projects in Chicago. The Department of Transportation justified the hold by citing a need to review the projects for potentially "unconstitutional" race-based contracting rules, while also blaming Democrats for the shutdown itself. This action follows similar freezes on funding for large infrastructure projects in other Democratic-led states and cities, intensifying the political nature of the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Speaking at Italian Tech Week, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos characterized the current enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence as an "industrial bubble," where stock prices and investment levels are often disconnected from business fundamentals. However, he emphasized that the underlying AI technology is real and will ultimately provide "gigantic" benefits to society. Bezos compared the situation to past technological bubbles, noting that even if many companies fail, the period of intense investment often produces lasting and valuable innovations.

Kennedy Jr. has fired Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a prominent scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), just three weeks after she filed a formal whistleblower complaint.

Her termination is part of a wider series of firings and budget cuts impacting federal health agencies under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates in the U.S. are encountering a particularly challenging job market, as a broader economic slowdown disproportionately affects new entrants to the workforce. Federal data indicates that the unemployment rate for this group has reached a nine-year high, and the traditional employment advantage of having a bachelor's degree has diminished significantly. This trend is attributed to a "low-hiring" environment where there is a surplus of graduates competing for a shrinking number of entry-level, white-collar jobs, leading to widespread frustration.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has made the decision to exclude star midfielder Jude Bellingham from his latest squad for upcoming matches, despite Bellingham's wish to be included after recovering from surgery. The move is being interpreted as a clear message from Tuchel that no player has an automatic place in the team and that he is building a squad that is not dependent on any single individual. Tuchel stated that while England is a better team with Bellingham, he must plan for contingencies, especially with the World Cup on the horizon.</p>
