            <h2>UK Economy Shows Unexpected Growth in February</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK economy experienced a surprising 0.5% growth in February, exceeding economists' predictions of 0.1%. This boost was primarily driven by strong performances in manufacturing, production, and the services sector, particularly in computer programming, telecoms, and car dealerships. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the encouraging figures but emphasized the need for further efforts to stimulate economic growth and improve living standards. However, economists caution that this growth may be short-lived due to upcoming tax rises, increased energy bills, and the impact of new US tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping cautioned that tariff wars have no winners and that isolating oneself from the world is counterproductive. He voiced this during a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, marking his first interaction with a foreign leader since the escalation of tariff disputes between China and the United States. Xi emphasized that China is not afraid of oppression, signaling a firm stance against protectionist measures. Sanchez's visit underscores efforts to foster a balanced relationship between the European Union and China amidst global trade uncertainties.</p>

            <p>A new drug, capivasertib, has been approved for use on the NHS in England to treat a common type of advanced breast cancer. Clinical trials demonstrated that the drug, when combined with hormone therapy, can double the time it takes for the cancer to grow and can shrink tumors in some patients. This new treatment option offers hope for improving the quality of life for women with incurable breast cancer by delaying the need for chemotherapy and providing extra time for them to pursue their goals and enjoy life. Genetic testing will be necessary to determine eligibility for the treatment.</p>

            <p>Economists believe that China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its currency, the yuan, to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs due to concerns about triggering financial market instability and capital outflows. While the yuan has weakened recently, analysts anticipate the People's Bank of China (PBoC) will manage a gradual depreciation. A rapid devaluation could undermine consumer confidence and lead to capital flight, complicating Beijing's efforts to address slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese exporters are grappling with the impact of escalating U.S. tariffs by raising prices, diversifying operations, and, in some cases, halting shipments to the U.S. Some American companies are already seeking alternative suppliers, and U.S. consumers may face higher prices or limited access to certain products. The trade tensions are expected to significantly reduce China's shipments to the U.S., impacting employment and economic growth. Beijing is encouraging domestic sales to offset losses, but consumer spending remains weak.</p>

            <p>Experts fear that Donald Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs on China, could impede global climate action. The tariffs are expected to increase the cost of clean energy technologies in the U.S., potentially slowing down the country's transition to renewable energy. While some believe the global energy transition is unstoppable, others worry that the U.S.'s retreat from green energy could have long-term implications for global climate progress, as the country is a significant emitter of carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongly deported to El Salvador. While the court acknowledged the executive branch's authority in foreign affairs, it upheld a lower court's order requiring the administration to assist in Garcia's release and ensure his case is handled fairly. Garcia's lawyers are advocating for his immediate release from detention in El Salvador and his return to the United States.</p>
