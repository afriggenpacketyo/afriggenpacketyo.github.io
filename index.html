          <p>England prepares to face France in a crucial Women's Six Nations match, focusing on strategic kicking and shutting down France's attacking opportunities. Coach Mitchell emphasizes the need for accuracy in kicking to counter France's dangerous backs, particularly scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus. The team is also wary of rapid wing Joanna Grisez, highlighting the importance of a strong kicking game to pressure France and control territory. Harrison's tactical kicking is favored to exploit space behind France's back three, potentially securing a starting spot before the Rugby World Cup.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, shortly after he was sentenced for tax crimes. Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, was involved in efforts to publicize Ashley Biden's diary during the 2020 election, aiming to undermine Joseph R. Biden Jr. Fago, a longtime Republican donor, was contacted by someone possessing the diary, which contained personal details about Ashley Biden's recovery from addiction. The pardon raises questions about the intersection of political alliances and presidential clemency.</p>
