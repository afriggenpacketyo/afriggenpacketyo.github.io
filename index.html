Its strategy involves selecting stocks that align with multiple long-term investment themes, such as AI and millennial-driven trends, to ensure consistent performance. This thematic, rules-based approach has resonated with investors, though its long-term sustainability remains to be proven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods across Central Texas have caused immense damage to the state's agricultural sector, with farmers and ranchers facing inundated properties, destroyed crops, and lost livestock. The disaster, which has resulted in over 121 fatalities, presents unique challenges for those in agritourism and specialty farming who may lack crop insurance. As the community begins the arduous cleanup and recovery process, the event highlights the increasing vulnerability of agriculture to extreme weather events. State resources, including relief funds and mental health support, are being mobilized to assist those affected.</p>

          <p>In her new book, veteran political reporter Salena Zito analyzes what she believes the media has overlooked regarding Donald Trump's connection with American voters in 2024. Zito suggests that Trump's appeal, particularly among young people, stems from his authentic interactions and focus on patriotism, which she observed firsthand at his rallies. The book also provides a firsthand account of the July 2024 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Zito was present. She reflects on the sense of community and excitement she witnessed among supporters at Trump's campaign events throughout the year.</p>

          <p>Virginia has fallen to fourth place in CNBC's annual 'Top States for Business' ranking, a significant drop from its number one spot last year. A primary reason for the decline is the state's weakening economy, heavily impacted by the Trump administration's initiative to reduce the federal workforce. With a substantial portion of its labor force employed by or contracting for the federal government, Virginia is projected to lose thousands of jobs. While Governor Glenn Youngkin expresses confidence in the private sector's ability to absorb these losses, economists warn of a potential ripple effect on the state's broader economy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to take effect on August 1, citing Ottawa's retaliatory duties and the flow of fentanyl as key reasons. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump warned that this rate could increase if Canada retaliates further. This new levy is separate from existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos. The announcement adds pressure to ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries, with the Canadian government stating it will continue to defend its workers and businesses ahead of the deadline.</p>

          <p>According to CDC data, emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. have surged to their highest point since 2019, with the Northeast experiencing a particularly sharp increase. Experts attribute this rise to larger tick populations and longer tick seasons, which are intensified by milder winters and wetter springs linked to climate change. Ticks can transmit various illnesses, including Lyme disease, making prevention crucial for public health. Health officials advise using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors to mitigate the risk of bites and associated diseases.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration promotes policies to boost the U.S. birth rate, including support for IVF, a significant aspect of the fertility equation is being ignored: male infertility. Despite male factors contributing to roughly half of infertility cases among heterosexual couples, evaluation and treatment for men are often overlooked, placing a disproportionate burden on women. While conservatives debate IVF versus alternative methods like restorative reproductive medicine, neither side has prioritized policies to improve access to male-infertility care. Experts argue that addressing this gap is a viable path to improving fertility outcomes without the political friction surrounding IVF.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are highlighting the significant long-term advantages of delaying Social Security retirement benefits until age 70. While eligibility begins at 62, waiting increases monthly payments by up to 8% per year, offering an inflation-protected income stream that is difficult to match elsewhere. To cover the financial gap during these interim years, a new report from the Bipartisan Policy Center suggests using a 'bridge strategy,' such as working longer or drawing from other retirement assets like investment portfolios or annuities. This approach helps maximize lifetime benefits and provides a crucial buffer against longevity risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly considering legal action against Tottenham Hotspur regarding their pursuit of midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. Forest is examining whether a confidentiality agreement within the player's £60m release clause has been breached, as they insist no permission was granted for Spurs to speak with him. The club is said to be furious with Tottenham's conduct and is prepared to take necessary steps to prevent the transfer. Despite the potential legal challenge, Tottenham remains hopeful that a deal for the England international can be successfully concluded.</p>

          <p>A mass trial in Tunisia has resulted in lengthy prison sentences for 21 political opponents of President Kais Saied, including opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi. Ghannouchi received a 14-year sentence, adding to his existing prison time, for charges his supporters deem politically motivated. This latest wave of convictions, targeting politicians both in and out of the country, is seen by human rights groups as a clear effort to eliminate all political opposition. Since taking office, Saied has dismantled democratic institutions and consolidated power, a stark reversal of his initial promises to uphold Tunisia's democracy.</p>

          <p>Families are facing higher costs for back-to-school shopping this year, with prices for essentials like backpacks increasing since 2019. A Deloitte survey indicates that while overall spending per child is expected to decrease slightly, many parents are adopting cautious strategies due to economic concerns and potential price hikes from new tariffs. A majority of parents report they are willing to switch to cheaper brands, shop at more affordable retailers, and cut back on non-essential items. This shift in behavior reflects widespread concern over inflation and a desire to preempt further price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study reveals that emergency vaccination programs for five major infectious diseases have been highly effective, reducing both deaths and infections by approximately 60% over a 23-year period. The research, which analyzed 210 outbreaks in 49 countries, suggests that swift vaccine deployment prevented much larger crises from diseases like Ebola, cholera, and measles. Beyond the significant public health impact, the study highlights substantial economic benefits, estimated at $32 billion, primarily from averting deaths and disability. The findings underscore the critical role of well-funded, rapid vaccination responses in managing global health threats.</p>

However, some health experts are questioning the findings due to a lack of transparency and a change in methodology that was not detailed in a peer-reviewed paper. While the rise in youth prediabetes is a serious public health concern, critics note the CDC's release of only a brief summary without raw data raises concerns about the agency's research standards.

While other developed nations have built robust, publicly supported systems, the U.S. system remains a 'hellscape' for many families.
