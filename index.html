          <h2>EU Considers Standardized Baggage Rules After Passenger Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 19:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is considering new laws to standardize sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, aiming to reduce passenger confusion and disputes over baggage fees. The proposal suggests a guaranteed free personal item measuring up to 40x30x15cm, including wheels and handles, for EU-based airlines. Consumer groups argue that the proposal does not go far enough, as it does not address charges for overhead cabin bags, while airlines maintain their baggage policies comply with the law and allow for lower fares. Consumer experts suggest passengers measure their bags after packing to avoid exceeding limits, and to consider airlines that include baggage without extra costs. The potential changes could impact UK passengers traveling to or from EU destinations using EU-based airlines.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills," which contain freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, as a novel approach to combatting drug-resistant superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can potentially replace harmful gut bacteria. Early data indicates that these pills can flush out superbugs from the bowel, addressing a major reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans. The trial, involving 41 patients at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London, has shown promising signals that poo pills could help tackle the rising threat of superbugs. The study also suggests the array of gut bacteria becomes more varied after the therapy, which is a sign of good health.</p>

Bregman, who joined the Red Sox this offseason, has been performing well, but the team's pitching has been struggling. The Red Sox, who were expected to contend for a playoff spot, are currently under .500 and fourth in the AL East.</p>

          <p>Victoria McCloud, a transgender former judge, argues that the Supreme Court's ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance about shared public spaces, puts trans people at risk. She fears the ruling, which defines a woman by biological sex, could lead to violence against transgender individuals in gendered spaces. McCloud is planning to challenge the Supreme Court judgement at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing the court did not hear from trans people before its ruling, and therefore breached her human rights. The EHRC has already suggested trans people should use their "powers of advocacy" to campaign for so-called third spaces that are gender-neutral to avoid these sorts of dilemmas.</p>

          <p>Six Palestinians were killed and several others wounded by Israeli gunfire near an aid distribution center in southern Gaza, according to Hamas officials. The incident occurred as people gathered to collect food supplies. The Israeli military claimed they fired warning shots at suspects who approached them in a threatening manner. The US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has paused operations at the center to improve safety. The United Nations has criticized the new distribution model, asserting that it endangers Palestinians and fails to provide sufficient aid.</p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed the department's plans following the House settlement agreement, which allows schools to pay athletes directly. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing while maintaining Olympic sports programs and staffing levels. The school will also preserve scholarship limits to maximize revenue sharing for each player. Revenue sharing will likely follow a formula similar to the back-payment distribution, with football players receiving the largest share. NIL deals exceeding $600 will require approval from NIL Go to ensure fair market value.</p>
