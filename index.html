          <p>A Breeze Airways flight from Virginia to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Grand Junction, Colorado, after a male passenger became disruptive. According to authorities, the intoxicated man yelled racist slurs and brandished a skateboard, leading to an altercation with the crew. Flight attendants restrained the passenger twice, but he managed to break free both times. The incident resulted in minor injuries to another passenger and a flight attendant, though police reports did not initially reflect this. Upon landing, the man was taken into custody by police at the direction of the FBI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Low-income households across the U.S. are facing increasing difficulty affording air conditioning as electricity costs rise, a problem exacerbated by climate change. Many families rely on the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for support, but the Trump administration's budget proposal aims to eliminate it, calling the program failed and fraudulent. Research from Texas A&M University links climate change directly to higher wholesale electricity costs, which are passed on to consumers. While solar power offers a cheaper alternative, administration policies favoring fossil fuels are expected to further increase energy expenses for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys' All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons offered a terse "My mouth is closed" when asked for an update on his contract extension negotiations. The comment comes amid an ongoing dispute with the team as he enters the final year of his rookie contract. Parsons, who has recorded double-digit sacks in each of his four NFL seasons, recently made a public trade request, though owner Jerry Jones has stated he has no intention of trading the star player. The situation remains unresolved as the Cowboys prepare to open their season against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>Following an $8 billion takeover, David Ellison and his new leadership team at Paramount have detailed their plan to revitalize the media company. The strategy involves nearly doubling the studio's annual film output to 15-20 movies and focusing on key franchises like “Top Gun,” “Star Trek,” and “Transformers.” Ellison emphasized a goal to depoliticize the company's content to appeal to a broader audience and restore Paramount as a top destination for talent. The new ownership, which includes Ellison's family and RedBird Capital, plans to make significant investments and operate with a long-term vision rather than focusing on quarterly earnings.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Imperial College London have coined the term "firewave" to describe the emerging threat of multiple, simultaneous urban wildfires in UK cities, driven by climate change. The phenomenon occurs during extended periods of hot, dry weather, which desiccates vegetation and sharply increases flammability. The warning follows recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh, highlighting the growing vulnerability of urban green spaces. Scientists are working with the London Fire Brigade to predict high-risk periods, proposing the term "firewave" be adopted by the Met Office to better signal extreme fire danger in urban areas.</p>

          <p>A new report from the VA's Office of Inspector General reveals that staffing shortages at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities have increased by 50% this fiscal year. The investigation found that 94% of facilities reported severe shortages of medical officers and 79% reported severe shortages of nurses, with psychology being the most frequently cited clinical shortage. The VA's press secretary criticized the report's methodology as subjective and unreliable, stating that the department's vacancy rates are lower than most other health systems. However, critics argue the findings reflect administration policies that have undermined the VA workforce and hindered veterans' access to care.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration will ask Congress for a long-term extension of the federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. The initial federalization, which includes the deployment of the National Guard, was enacted via an executive order citing a need to crack down on crime and is currently limited to 30 days. Any extension beyond that period requires a joint resolution from Congress, and Trump expressed confidence that Republicans would approve it unanimously. The move comes despite local police data showing a 26% decrease in overall violent crime in the city this year.</p>

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who convened the meetings, stated that Europe's and Ukraine's security interests must be protected and that a ceasefire must precede any broader agreement. Trump indicated there could be "very severe consequences" if Putin does not agree to end the war, and suggested he would contact Zelenskyy immediately after the summit.</p>

          <p>An outburst flood from a glacial-dammed basin near Juneau, Alaska, caused the Mendenhall River to reach a record high of 16.65 feet, but a potential disaster was averted. Newly installed temporary barriers, known as Hesco barriers, successfully held back the floodwaters, preventing the widespread destruction that damaged hundreds of homes in previous years. While some residents were evacuated as a precaution, city officials reported minimal flooding and credited the defensive measures with saving the community from a catastrophic event. The annual flooding is a result of climate change causing a nearby glacier to retreat, creating a basin that fills and releases massive amounts of water.</p>

The Justice Department supported the revocation, stating it is pursuing an "America first antitrust" approach focused on free markets rather than the "overly prescriptive" methods of the previous administration.

The Trump administration justified the high tariffs by citing the legal situation of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, claiming human rights abuses by the current government. President Lula called these reasons non-existent and stated Brazil is being sanctioned for its democratic process, but affirmed his preference for negotiation over escalating a trade conflict.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Swedish study suggests that drug treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) provide significant long-term benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, which followed nearly 150,000 people, found that taking ADHD medication was associated with notable reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. Researchers believe the medication helps by reducing impulsivity and improving concentration, which can mitigate behaviors leading to these negative outcomes. The findings provide crucial evidence that could help patients and doctors weigh the benefits of starting medication against potential side-effects.</p>

          <p>Nine years after legalizing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), Canada is grappling with complex ethical questions as demand for the procedure far exceeds predictions. The country's system is uniquely defined by its emphasis on patient autonomy, where a condition is considered incurable if treatment is not acceptable to the patient, regardless of prognosis. This places a heavy burden on clinicians, who must make difficult discretionary judgments, such as in cases where patients with treatable illnesses request MAID. The high demand is partly attributed to a culture of awareness and a system of MAID-coordination centers that facilitate seeking second opinions, unlike in many European countries.</p>

To mature, it needs new infrastructure, such as independent certification for creators and collaborative frameworks to help them scale their impact and compete in the attention economy.</p>

          <p>A Washington, D.C. man is facing federal assault charges after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions over the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city. According to the criminal complaint, the man confronted the agent, who was on patrol with Metro Transit Police, shouting profanities before throwing the sandwich. The confrontation comes as President Trump has deployed National Guard troops and placed the city's police under partial federal oversight, citing crime rates that local data shows have actually been decreasing.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hochman, CEO of Brinker International, reported that a significant increase in marketing investment has been a key driver of growth for its Chili's restaurant chain. The company's marketing budget grew from $32 million to $137 million over three years, fueling strategies that include leveraging social media influencers and standardizing a popular $10.99 value meal. These efforts contributed to a 23.7% increase in same-store sales at Chili's in the recent quarter. Hochman stated that this growth strategy is essential for combating rising labor and food costs, as it provides leverage on fixed expenses and helps expand profit margins.</p>

          <p>Perplexity AI has made a public offer to buy Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion, a dramatic move coming just before a judge is expected to rule on remedies for Google's search monopoly. The Department of Justice has previously called for Google to divest Chrome to create a more competitive market. While analysts view Perplexity's bid as not entirely serious, it underscores the potential for a forced breakup of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Analysts have placed varying valuations on Alphabet's assets, with some estimating Chrome's value at $50 billion and Google Cloud's at over $600 billion, highlighting the massive financial stakes involved.

A significant driver of recent success has been the demand for AI infrastructure, with Cisco securing over $2 billion in orders in this category for the 2025 fiscal year, more than double its internal goal. CEO Chuck Robbins noted a strong sales pipeline from enterprises for AI infrastructure, indicating that he does not see AI as a fleeting trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from UC Riverside reveals that land subsidence in California's San Joaquin Valley is significantly lowering home prices. The study found that homes in affected areas sell for 2.4% to 5.4% less than they would on stable ground, resulting in an estimated collective loss of $1.87 billion in home values from 2015 to 2021. The sinking, caused by decades of excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture, has worsened during recent droughts, with some areas dropping a foot per year. The findings highlight another costly consequence of groundwater overdraft, adding pressure on local agencies to implement California's sustainable groundwater management law and curb overpumping.</p>

Lai, a British citizen, faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces under the controversial national security law imposed by China in 2020. His case is widely seen by critics as a key indicator of the erosion of legal autonomy and freedom of speech in the city. Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, has been hailed as a hero by democracy advocates but is viewed as a traitor by mainland China.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its decision to withhold billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals focused on procedural grounds, stating that the humanitarian nonprofits who sued were not eligible to bring the challenge. This ruling represents a major blow to global health and humanitarian programs, as the withheld funds include significant amounts for HIV/AIDS prevention. Critics argue the aid cuts could have a devastating human impact and that the ruling chips away at the separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to impound funds.</p>

This marks a dramatic increase from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was ranked last at $930 million. The surge in value is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.

The hunger is compounded by a cholera outbreak in squalid displacement camps.

During the announcement, Trump criticized past cultural awards for being "too woke" and claimed he was about "98% involved" in the selection process to ensure the lineup was different. The move is seen as part of a broader effort in his second term to exert influence over the nation's cultural institutions.</p>
