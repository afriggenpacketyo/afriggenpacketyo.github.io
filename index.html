          <p>Former Salomon Brothers bond trader Howard Rubin and his ex-personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, were arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, accused of operating a decade-long network from 2009-2019. Prosecutors detailed allegations of Rubin brutalizing women, sometimes beyond their consent, in luxury hotels and a Manhattan penthouse converted into a "sex dungeon" with specialized equipment, including devices to "shock or electrocute women." A federal magistrate judge ordered Rubin detained without bail, citing concerns he was a flight risk due to his extraordinary wealth, had discussed hiring a "hitman" against civil suit plaintiffs, and previously attempted witness intimidation. Victims reportedly expressed universal fear of Rubin, who pleaded not guilty and is appealing a prior civil judgment finding him liable for sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Leigh Leopards secured their place in the Super League semi-finals by defeating Wakefield Trinity 26-10 in a dominant play-off eliminator match. The hosts, who finished nine points ahead of Trinity in the regular season, established a commanding 18-0 lead in the first half through tries from Keanan Brand, Isaac Liu, and Josh Charnley. Despite a second-half reply from Jayden Myers, Leigh maintained their advantage with a Gareth O'Brien penalty and Alec Tuitavake's score. This victory earns Leigh a challenging semi-final trip to second-placed Wigan, as they bid to reach their first Grand Final after making strategic changes from last year's semi-final loss.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are scrutinizing the federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, viewing it as a significant test of the justice system's independence. They highlight a pattern of President Trump claiming political interference by Democrats, now manifesting in aggressive prosecutions, including Comey's charges for alleged false testimony and obstruction. The indictment followed Trump's firing of a U.S. attorney with doubts about the case and his public pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi. Experts warn that Trump's overt politicization of the Justice Department could undermine the case's viability and set a dangerous precedent for future administrations.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent Black liberation activist and U.S. fugitive, has died in Havana, Cuba, at 78 due to health conditions and advanced age. Born Joanne Deborah Chesimard, Shakur was convicted in 1977 for the 1973 murder of a New Jersey State Trooper and escaped prison in 1979, later receiving political asylum in Cuba in 1984. Her case became a symbol of fraught U.S.-Cuba relations, with American authorities, including President Trump, long demanding her return. Shakur maintained her innocence, and her writings resonated with the Black Lives Matter movement, while New Jersey officials lamented her passing without facing full accountability.</p>

Federal prosecutors allege Tooley distributed significant amounts of the drug, including 100 grams near his nonprofit and 160 grams while a young child was present in his car. He is also accused of targeting and recruiting women, many suffering from substance abuse, for commercial sex and drug distribution, using violence and leveraging his nonprofit's phone for transactions. Tooley, who has a prior 2010 cocaine distribution conviction and multiple supervised release violations, now faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Shane Tamura, the gunman responsible for the deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting in July that killed four people, has been posthumously diagnosed with low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed the findings, noting Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, left notes referencing CTE and requesting his brain be studied. While the exact link between CTE and his actions remains under study, experts like Chris Nowinski emphasize that 12 years of contact sports put him at risk, leading to significant brain changes affecting judgment and behavior. This diagnosis serves as a grim reminder of the need to prevent brain trauma in young athletes.</p>

Economists estimate each week of shutdown could cost the U.S. economy approximately $7 billion, impacting investor and consumer confidence amid existing economic headwinds. While mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare would continue, administrative services and federal procurement could be disrupted, causing financial strain for workers and ripple effects across the broader economy.

          <p>Following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, legal experts warn that President Trump's public comments and pressure on the Justice Department could weaken the prosecution's case. Trump praised the indictment and labeled Comey a "dirty cop," continuing a nearly decade-long feud. Former federal prosecutors suggest that Trump's actions create an appearance of political motivation, potentially allowing Comey's defense to argue selective or vindictive prosecution. The brevity of the two-page indictment, coupled with the unusual circumstances of a Trump loyalist taking over the U.S. Attorney's office to secure the charges, further raises questions about the process's integrity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid funding previously approved by Congress, granting an emergency request. The 6-3 decision, with liberal justices dissenting, indicated that the harm to the executive branch's foreign affairs capability outweighs the plaintiffs' potential harm, though it is not a final ruling on the merits. The dispute centers on Trump's use of a "pocket rescission" to claw back funds, a move the Government Accountability Office deemed illegal. Dissenting Justice Kagan highlighted the high stakes for the separation of powers, as the ruling prevents funds from reaching intended recipients and impacts organizations reliant on federal dollars.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast station owners Sinclair and Nexstar announced they are restoring "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to their ABC affiliate stations, effective Friday, following a temporary week-long suspension. The preemption occurred after comments Kimmel made regarding the alleged murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and President Trump's MAGA movement. Both companies denied any government influence on their decision, asserting their commitment to free speech and local community interests, while acknowledging "thoughtful feedback from viewers." The incident had sparked questions about media influence and First Amendment protections, with Sinclair noting it had proposed measures to "strengthen accountability" at ABC, which were not adopted.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a Category 3 major hurricane in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, though no immediate watches or warnings have been issued for the U.S. The storm is located northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and is forecast to continue strengthening over the next few days as it moves northwest. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and forecasters are also monitoring a second system in the northeast Caribbean that could become Tropical Storm Imelda. While not directly impacting land currently, both systems pose potential downstream impacts for the Southeast U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>Rafie Ollah Shouhed, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner in Los Angeles, is suing the federal government for $50 million after allegedly being assaulted and detained by ICE agents during a raid. His attorney claims Shouhed suffered broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury when agents reportedly slammed him to the pavement, ignoring his protests about recent heart surgery. Shouhed was detained for nearly 12 hours without charges, even after agents allegedly confirmed his citizenship. This incident is part of an aggressive mass deportation campaign by the Trump administration in Southern California, leading to multiple lawsuits over alleged unconstitutional racial profiling and excessive force.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Debt Relief Programs Versus Credit Counseling in 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 16:38:06 EDT</div>

          <p>Millions of Americans face significant credit card debt, totaling $1.21 trillion, prompting many to explore debt relief options. This article compares debt relief programs, which aim to reduce the total amount owed through strategies like settlement or consolidation, with credit counseling, which focuses on education, budgeting, and structured repayment plans. Debt relief can offer faster reductions but carries higher fees, credit score impacts, and risks of scams. Credit counseling is a slower, lower-risk process that helps rebuild credit through consistent payments. Choosing the right option depends on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and commitment to a plan, with consulting an expert recommended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An influx of federal agents from 13 U.S. agencies, including the FBI and DEA, along with 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers, will deploy to Memphis next week as part of the Trump administration's crime crackdown. Governor Bill Lee described the multi-phase operation as a "generational opportunity" to combat crime, with National Guard troops providing unarmed support roles. While Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community questions, he highlighted the city's progress in reducing violent crime and its existing task force collaborations. This deployment follows similar federal interventions in other Democratic-led cities like Los Angeles and Washington D.C., raising concerns about political targeting.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are escalating demands for information regarding White House border czar Tom Homan's alleged involvement in federal contracts, following reports he accepted $50,000 cash from undercover FBI agents. Seven Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee are pressing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for contracts, communications, and other materials by October 10. The probe, initiated by the prior administration and closed by Trump appointees, examined whether Homan promised government action in return for payment. Democrats warn this alleged conduct is unacceptable and raises concerns about the administration "weaponizing" justice to protect allies, especially given Homan's past consultancy with a major ICE contractor.</p>
