          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on environmental impact statements required for major infrastructure projects, potentially expediting approvals. The ruling, in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, clarifies that environmental studies should focus on the immediate project and not on broader, indirect impacts. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, stated that NEPA has been used excessively to hinder infrastructure development and that the ruling aims to bring judicial review back in line with the law's original intent. The case involved a proposed railway in Utah, and the decision could affect future energy and transportation projects.</p>
