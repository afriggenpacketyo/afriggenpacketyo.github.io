        <p>Rodrigo Duterte, former president of the Philippines, was arrested at Manila's airport based on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.  The ICC is investigating Duterte for crimes against humanity related to his anti-drug campaign, which involved numerous extrajudicial killings.  Duterte's arrest represents a significant step toward accountability for victims and their families, though the ICC's ability to secure justice against other high-profile individuals remains uncertain.</p>

        <p>President Trump announced a 25% increase in tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, bringing the total to 50%, in retaliation for Canadian tariffs on electricity. He also threatened further tariffs on the auto industry and urged Canada to drop other tariffs and become the 51st US state.  The move is described as a retaliatory measure and is escalating trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Environmental advocates warn that Trump administration policies, supported by House Republicans and Elon Musk's Doge agency, are weakening the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and threatening numerous species with extinction.  These policies include the creation of a committee that can effectively veto ESA protections, staff layoffs at wildlife agencies, and efforts to revise the ESA to expedite industry projects.  Advocates express deep concern about the potential consequences of these actions.</p>

        <h2>Multiple States Move to Ban Artificial Food Dyes</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 11:00:50 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>At least a dozen US states are enacting legislation to ban commonly used food dyes and chemical additives, citing health concerns, particularly for children.  West Virginia's ban is particularly comprehensive, prohibiting several dyes found in various foods.  While the food industry opposes these bans, citing potential price increases and questioning the scientific evidence, proponents argue that the bans are necessary to protect public health, citing research and the growing public awareness of the issue. The  'Make America Healthy Again' movement is seen as a contributing factor.</p>
