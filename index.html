          <p>The rapid expansion of AI is creating an unprecedented demand for electricity, placing energy company GE Vernova in a critical position. Tech giants require massive power for their data centers, leading to a surge in orders for GE Vernova's gas-fired turbines, with the company's manufacturing capacity largely sold out for years. This demand has caused the company's stock to soar, reflecting its pivotal role in powering the ongoing technological revolution. Despite the windfall, the company is cautiously expanding production, mindful of a past boom-and-bust cycle in the early 2000s. (not investment advice)</p>

Her tenure marked a significant period of transition for MI5 in the post-Cold War era.

          <p>Student loan borrowers who remain in the now-defunct SAVE plan's forbearance will face significant financial consequences as interest charges resumed on August 1. Experts warn that staying in this payment pause will cause loan balances to grow and will not count toward progress for loan forgiveness programs. The Department of Education has recommended that affected borrowers switch to an available income-driven repayment plan, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, to manage their debt effectively. Failing to switch may result in being automatically moved to a new plan with potentially less favorable terms in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

According to a recent report, Mamdani's campaign is tracking Johnson's challenges, such as very low approval ratings, to avoid similar pitfalls in his own political career. While both politicians share progressive ideologies, Mamdani is said to be aiming for a more pragmatic approach, drawing comparisons to Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. This strategic observation highlights the complexities progressive leaders face when transitioning from activism to governing major American cities.</p>

Trump's comments also followed reports that Sweeney is a registered Republican, which he noted in his post. The incident places the actress and the retailer at the center of a cultural debate, with American Eagle stating the campaign was always just about their denim products.</p>

The author expresses concern over recent legislative and judicial actions, such as using taxpayer money for religious education, which they contend violate the establishment clause.

Economists suggest this weakness in the labor market, traditionally a lagging indicator, points to elevated recession risks.

The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was also found to infect shellfish, solving a long-standing ecological mystery. The epidemic has critically endangered species like the sunflower sea star, leading to cascading effects on the ecosystem, such as the destruction of kelp forests by unchecked sea urchin populations.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the war in Ukraine has now become a defining issue for Donald Trump's presidency, regardless of his initial intentions. The author contends that after attempts to broker a quick end to the conflict failed, Trump's direct engagement, from berating allies to threatening Russia with nuclear force, has made him a central figure. The article suggests that Trump now owns the conflict's trajectory and must make consequential decisions, such as imposing severe secondary sanctions on Russia's trade partners. This situation illustrates that a president cannot simply choose which global crises to engage with.</p>

          <p>Amazon is restructuring its audio business, resulting in the layoff of approximately 110 employees from its Wondery podcast and Audible divisions. As part of the changes, Wondery's CEO is stepping down, and some of its units will be consolidated under Audible. The reorganization aims to better align the teams to address the evolving podcast landscape, particularly the rise of video podcasts on platforms like YouTube. The move comes nearly five years after Amazon acquired Wondery, known for hit shows like "Dirty John," in an effort to expand its original audio content.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over an eight-week period, participants on the minimally processed diet consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This research, the largest of its kind, suggests that the level of food processing itself plays a significant role in calorie intake and weight management. The findings reinforce the benefits of diets based on whole foods, cooked from their natural state.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that a makeshift Florida detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," will serve as a model for a new network of state-run migrant detention centers. The strategy involves establishing facilities near airports in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana to increase the efficiency of detaining and deporting unauthorized migrants. Noem stated that this model is more cost-effective and will be funded by a new $45 billion allocation for ICE. The plan has drawn criticism from legal experts who question its legality and from advocates citing claims of inhumane conditions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer has drawn sharp criticism from former agency leaders and non-partisan economic groups. The firing occurred after a jobs report showed slowing growth and large downward revisions, which Trump alleged, without evidence, were "faked" and "rigged." A group chaired by both Obama- and Trump-appointed former BLS commissioners called the firing meritless and stated it undermines the credibility of federal economic data. They, along with other economic associations, have urged Congress to investigate the removal and ensure the non-partisan integrity of the crucial statistical agency.</p>

The visit comes amid a recent shift in Trump's rhetoric, which has become tougher on Moscow, including public condemnation of attacks on civilians.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation known as the 60% rule significantly impacts senior homeowners using a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a common type of reverse mortgage. This rule limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds during the first year, a measure designed to prevent them from depleting their home equity too quickly. While intended as a safeguard, this can pose challenges for seniors who need a larger lump sum for immediate expenses. An exception allows for a larger withdrawal if it's needed to pay off an existing mortgage or other mandatory obligations. (not investment advice)</p>

Reinhart also noted that a shift away from globalization, characterized by restrictive immigration policies and efforts to reshore manufacturing, could slow population and economic growth. She advised that in this volatile environment, both investors and workers should focus on hedging and adopting longer-term financial plans. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is intended to provide time for both sides to implement a trade agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump. That political agreement, which set a 15% tariff on most EU goods entering the U.S., is seen as a step toward restoring stability in transatlantic trade relations.
