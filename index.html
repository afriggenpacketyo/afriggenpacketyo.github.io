          <p>Severe flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in over 100 fatalities, with search and rescue operations ongoing for missing individuals, including several from a summer camp. The disaster has sparked a sharp political debate, with Senator Ted Cruz defending his response time while the White House refutes claims that cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contributed to the tragedy. Despite NOAA confirming that its weather service office was fully staffed and issued warnings with significant lead time, some Democratic lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the federal government's preparedness and response.</p>

          <p>Beijing has cautioned the Trump administration against reigniting trade tensions by restoring tariffs, threatening to retaliate if the fragile truce is broken. China's official state media emphasized that dialogue and cooperation are the only correct solutions and warned against what it termed U.S. "bullying," setting the stage for a potential escalation. The commentary also specifically targeted nations like Vietnam that are making separate supply chain deals with the U.S., stating that China will "respond resolutely" to any agreements that it believes undermine its own legitimate interests.

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed a broad increase in import tariffs but has notified 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, of new, specific levies set to take effect on August 1. The move extends a previous 90-day pause, with President Trump indicating the new deadline is firm but potentially negotiable, creating continued uncertainty for global markets. Affected nations like Japan and South Korea have expressed regret over the announcement but have committed to continuing negotiations to secure a beneficial trade agreement with the United States.

          <p>Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility more than three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home. He and his wife, Yvette, who was also shot but released earlier, were victims of what authorities describe as politically motivated attacks that also resulted in the deaths of another state representative and her husband. The alleged perpetrator is facing multiple federal and state charges, including murder and attempted murder, and could face the death penalty if convicted.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking gene therapy has successfully reversed hearing loss in a clinical trial involving children and adults with a specific genetic form of deafness. The treatment involves a single injection into the inner ear that delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All ten participants in the small-scale trial showed significant hearing improvement within six months, with some children recovering almost full hearing, offering hope for future treatments for other genetic causes of deafness. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated.</p>

Police arrested two suspects who allegedly attacked the victim after one cut in line; one suspect reportedly struck the victim with a mason jar, and the other used the broken glass to stab him. The incident highlights a growing trend of violence associated with the highly profitable resale market for the popular trading cards, which has prompted some retailers to change their sales policies.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology announced it will sever ties with online course provider Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partnership misled students. The lawsuit claimed a cybersecurity "boot camp" was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of former students, and both parties agreed to new transparency rules, though Caltech did not admit to any wrongdoing in the matter.</p>

          <p>This commentary article argues that the Trump administration's recent actions reveal misplaced priorities, focusing on immigration enforcement while cutting funds for critical scientific and medical research. The author criticizes the "show of force" by federal agents in places like L.A.'s MacArthur Park as a political stunt that terrorizes communities without addressing real problems. The piece contrasts the billions added for ICE and Border Patrol with the billions cut from the National Institutes of Health and weather forecasting agencies, suggesting the nation is ignoring greater threats like pandemics and climate change.</p>

          <p>An 83-year-old woman has died in North Carolina after her vehicle was swept away by floodwaters from the remnants of Tropical Depression Chantal. The storm system brought heavy rain and flash flooding to numerous counties, prompting dozens of water rescues and a state of emergency declaration in Orange County. As the storm moves northeast over Virginia, flood watches remain in effect for several mid-Atlantic states. The flooding in North Carolina caused significant damage, inundating homes, businesses, and collapsing a section of a state highway.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, stating that tens of thousands of layoffs are no longer necessary. The VA indicated it is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze. The initial plan, which could have cut over 80,000 jobs, drew criticism from Democratic lawmakers who argue the current staff reduction is due to a "toxic work environment" and will inevitably harm services for veterans.</p>

          <p>China has activated another branch of the M503 flight path in the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, a move that has raised alarms in Taiwan. The new route, W121, is one of several offshoots from the main M503 path, which at its closest point is only 4.2 nautical miles from the strait's unofficial median line. Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration stated the change was a technical adjustment to relieve air traffic pressure and improve safety. However, the unilateral action is seen by Taipei as a potential security concern and a further erosion of the status quo.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. The review also found no evidence of a so-called "client list" or credible proof that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals, debunking widespread conspiracy theories. In a memo, officials stated that while Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, the investigation did not uncover evidence to support charges against any uncharged third parties, and that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no purpose in achieving justice for victims.</p>

The situation highlights the ongoing clash between Hungary's right-wing government, led by Viktor Orban, and LGBTQ+ rights advocates in the country, where recent laws have targeted the community.</p>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons warns that an overwhelming flow of drugs, often smuggled in by drones, is destabilizing the prison system in England and Wales. The report finds that overcrowding and staff shortages leave inmates with little to do, leading many to use drugs out of boredom, which in turn fuels uncontrolled criminality within the jails. According to a prisoner survey, 39% found it easy to get drugs, and the report highlights that the failure to control the problem poses a significant challenge to rehabilitation efforts and even national security.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targeted organizations providing abortion services, even though federal funds are not used for the procedures themselves. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the provision was an unconstitutional attack designed to penalize the organization and would devastate its ability to provide other essential health services to its patients.</p>
