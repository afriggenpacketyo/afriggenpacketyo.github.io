          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in one fatality and several injuries, with the FBI treating the incident as an intentional act of terrorism. The blast, which occurred on North Indian Canyon Drive, damaged nearby buildings and prompted a large-scale investigation involving federal and local authorities. While the clinic's staff and reproductive materials remained secure, the incident has raised concerns about targeted violence against reproductive healthcare facilities. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi condemned the violence, emphasizing the administration's commitment to protecting women and mothers. This incident is under active investigation to determine the motives and identify any potential threats to similar facilities. </p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-total darkness and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings, including the first-ever such warning for Chicago. The storm, driven by winds up to 70 miles per hour, originated near Bloomington, Illinois, and reduced visibility to less than a quarter-mile in minutes, creating hazardous conditions on major highways. This event is linked to exceptionally dry soil conditions in central Illinois, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era, making the region vulnerable to such phenomena. The article notes that dust storms are more common in the desert Southwest and southern Great Plains, but the unusual conditions in the Midwest led to this dramatic weather event. </p>

          <p>Photographer Andrew Fusek Peters spent a decade capturing the beauty and diversity of British back garden wildlife, culminating in his book 'Garden Safari.' The images, taken mostly in his modest Shropshire garden, showcase battling birds, squabbling squirrels, and rare moments like a hare feeding her leveret. Peters, who began focusing on garden wildlife after a cancer diagnosis, uses a unique technique to capture birds in mid-flight, revealing rainbow-like diffraction effects on their wings. His book is a rallying cry to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens, emphasizing the importance of these creatures in the face of climate change and habitat loss. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but limited its use to older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions, raising concerns about access for healthy individuals under 65. This decision contrasts with the broader approvals of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and reflects a more restrictive approach from health agencies. The approval requires Novavax to conduct studies on potential heart conditions associated with the vaccine, potentially costing the company millions. Experts worry that these restrictions could limit vaccine options and increase skepticism, particularly given the current administration's stance on vaccines. </p>
