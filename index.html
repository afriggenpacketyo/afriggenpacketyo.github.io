          <p>After a decade with Tottenham Hotspur, club captain Son Heung-min is leaving the team, with a potential move to Los Angeles FC in Major League Soccer. The South Korean forward, who joined in 2015, became a club legend, scoring 173 goals and recently helping Spurs secure their first major trophy in 17 years with a Europa League victory. The article reflects on his significant impact on the club, his immense popularity in South Korea where he is considered a national treasure, and his emotional departure as a celebrated figure in the Premier League.

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner has raised questions about Joe Root's performance in Australia, suggesting the English batter needs to adjust his technique for the upcoming Ashes series. Warner pointed out that Root has never scored a century in Australia and is often dismissed by bowler Josh Hazlewood, humorously advising him to "take the surfboard off his front leg." Currently in England to play for London Spirit in The Hundred, Warner also commented on facing veteran English bowler James Anderson, noting the white ball used in the tournament will be different from the red Dukes ball from past Ashes series. Warner's comments add a layer of friendly rivalry before the winter tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Justice is increasing its scrutiny of state voter registration lists to identify and remove noncitizens. This initiative is part of the Trump administration's broader push for election integrity, stemming from a March executive order tasking the DOJ with reviewing how states manage their voter rolls. While some states are cooperating, others have resisted requests for voter data, with New Hampshire rejecting the demand and Orange County, California, being sued for withholding information. Critics, like Senator Dick Durbin, argue these efforts could disproportionately hinder the voting rights of minority and low-income communities under the guise of combating fraud.</p>

          <p>Recent economic reports present a confusing view of the U.S. economy under President Trump, with conflicting data on growth, trade, and employment. While GDP showed robust growth in the second quarter, this followed an unexpected contraction, and the first half of the year saw mediocre growth overall. The administration's tariff strategy has caused wild swings, with imports surging and then plummeting, creating bizarre economic consequences. Despite the president's demands, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates on hold due to stubborn inflation concerns. A surprisingly weak July jobs report has further complicated the narrative, revealing stalled job creation and fueling uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new illustrative comic delves into why many people feel awkward or uncomfortable when receiving compliments and what this reaction reveals about their self-perception. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao explain the science behind this common social interaction, highlighting how one's response can impact both their own feelings and those of the person giving the praise. The piece makes a case for learning to graciously accept kind remarks, framing it as a beneficial social skill. It serves as a lighthearted yet insightful guide for anyone who instinctively dismisses praise, offering a different perspective on these everyday exchanges.</p>

This marks a shift from his first term, where many leaders were more distant; now, figures like the UK's Keir Starmer and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu have offered grand gestures and praise to curry favor. Analysts suggest this strategy acknowledges Trump's personal and transactional leadership style, where he is the ultimate decision-maker. This approach appears to be yielding results for foreign leaders, such as securing NATO defense spending commitments and favorable trade deal discussions, by appealing directly to the president's desire to be seen as a winner.</p>

          <p>Japan's meteorological agency has confirmed that July 2025 was the country's hottest July since record-keeping began in 1898, with the average temperature 2.89°C above the 1991-2020 norm. This marks the third consecutive year of a record-breaking July, and the heatwave is expected to continue with severe temperatures forecast for the northern and western regions in August. The extreme weather, which saw a record high of 41.2°C in Hyogo, is also linked to an unusually early end to the rainy season. Experts warn that the changing climate is impacting the country's iconic cherry blossoms, as winters are no longer consistently cold enough to trigger proper flowering.</p>

The club recently rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old Swedish forward, whom they value at around £150m. Isak was left out of the team's pre-season tour, officially due to a minor injury, and has been seen training alone at his former club, Real Sociedad. Howe admitted he is largely removed from the dealings back in England but expressed his hope that Isak will ultimately remain with Newcastle for the upcoming season.</p>

Trump, without evidence, accused the agency of rigging the numbers, a claim that has drawn sharp criticism and accusations of politicizing vital economic data.

By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced the crop's evolution back approximately nine million years. This pioneering study, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this ancient cross-breeding was the key evolutionary driver for the development of tubers, the starchy part of the potato that has made it a global food staple. The findings shed new light on the genetic history of one of the world's most important crops.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC defeated Pachuca in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in their Leagues Cup match, but the result effectively ends their chances of advancing in the tournament. Dennis Bouanga scored early for LAFC, but the team was reduced to ten men after Nathan Ordaz received a red card, allowing Pachuca to equalize. Despite winning the shootout 4-2 to secure two points, LAFC's total of three points from two games leaves them in a position where qualification for the quarterfinals is nearly impossible. The match was contentious, with both teams finishing with ten players.</p>

          <p>The search continues for Michael Paul Brown, the 45-year-old man suspected of killing four people in a shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities have located the pickup truck Brown was driving but he remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous. The shooting, described as a "senseless act of violence," has prompted a large law enforcement response, and residents in the search area have been urged to stay indoors and remain on high alert. The identities of the four victims have not yet been released pending family notification, and a motive for the attack has not been established.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has delivered a significant setback to the Trump administration by upholding a block on indiscriminate "roving patrols" by immigration agents in Southern California. The ruling affirms that agents cannot stop individuals based solely on factors like race or location, as this does not meet the 4th Amendment's standard for reasonable suspicion. The court's fiery opinion rejected the government's claim that the injunction would harm enforcement efforts, noting the likelihood of future unconstitutional stops was "considerable." Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the decision as a victory for the rule of law that would help ease the fear gripping immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Amid a scorching summer and widespread wildfires across Greece, Turkey, and other parts of Europe, travel experts are advising tourists on their rights and options. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel to these destinations safe, the situation remains volatile. Experts advise that standard travel insurance should cover cancellations or curtailments if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, if you choose not to go while travel is still deemed safe, you are unlikely to be covered unless you purchased additional catastrophe coverage. In all cases, travelers are encouraged to communicate directly with their airlines, hotels, and insurance providers to understand their specific circumstances.</p>

          <p>A growing trend on social media involves elaborate and extreme bedtime beauty rituals, popularized by "morning shed" videos where users remove silicone masks, mouth tape, and other products. Capitalizing on this, Kim Kardashian's brand Skims launched a facial shapewear mask, which sold out rapidly despite criticism that it promotes harmful beauty standards. Medical professionals are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that such wraps provide lasting results and may even cause skin irritation. Critics argue these products fuel insecurity by suggesting even natural facial features need to be altered, turning self-care into a performative quest for aesthetic perfection.</p>

          <p>China's customs administration has tightened import regulations on durians from Vietnam after detecting hazardous levels of cadmium and alkaline yellow in shipments. The new rules mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require that all durian shipments be accompanied by qualified test reports. Under the stricter protocol, incoming Vietnamese durians are now subject to "batch by batch" testing, and any shipments that fail to meet safety standards will be returned or destroyed, with the corresponding exporters suspended from the Chinese market. The move follows a significant 45% year-on-year drop in the value of fresh durian imports from Vietnam in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian heavily criticizes the trade deal negotiated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with the Trump administration, labeling it a "humiliation" for Europe. The authors argue the deal is economically damaging, granting the U.S. favored market access while key European industries are neglected, and undermines the EU's international credibility by condoning coercion. The piece contends that von der Leyen was unprepared to reject the lopsided terms and that her pledge of EU investment in the U.S. is disastrous.

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla liable in a 2019 fatal crash and ordered the company to pay $243 million to the family of the deceased victim and her injured boyfriend. The jury determined that Tesla was partly responsible because its Autopilot technology failed to prevent the crash, which occurred when the driver became distracted looking for a fallen phone. The court argued the system should have disengaged and that the driver received no alerts before running a stop sign and hitting the couple. Tesla has called the verdict "wrong" and plans to appeal, maintaining that drivers must remain fully attentive while using the assistance system.</p>

          <p>Two men accused of running an illegal cannabis extraction operation in Los Angeles County have been charged with murder following the deaths of five of their workers in separate incidents. Prosecutors allege that Ted Chien and Han Quan Jiao administered the business, where an explosion in 2023 killed four workers and a fire a year later killed another. The deaths occurred at illicit labs used for honey oil extraction. The district attorney stated the case highlights the deadly results of illegal operations that prioritize greed over safety. If convicted, Chien could face the death penalty, and Jiao could face a life sentence.</p>
