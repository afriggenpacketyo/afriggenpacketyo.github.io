          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was questioned by the Secret Service regarding a social media post featuring seashells arranged to read "86 47," a phrase critical of Donald Trump. Administration officials claimed the post was an assassination threat, prompting the investigation. Comey voluntarily participated in the interview, while critics argue the administration is exaggerating the situation to harass a political opponent. This article highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and Trump, stemming from the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The incident underscores the sensitivity surrounding perceived threats against political figures and the potential for politicization of law enforcement investigations.</p>

          <p>Dawn Richard, a member of music groups Diddy Dirty Money and Danity Kane, testified to the jury she "observed Cassie being attacked" by Sean Combs in his Los Angeles hotel in 2009. Richard testified that Ventura dropped to the ground, "literally trying to hide her face or her head." The defense objected to many of the questions put to Richard by the prosecution so the judge adjourned the court and instructed the jury to return 8:30 a.m. ET Monday. Court is scheduled to adjourn each day next week at 3 p.m. ET</p>
