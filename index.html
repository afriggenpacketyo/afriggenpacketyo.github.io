          <p>Swiss food giant Nestle has announced a significant restructuring plan that will eliminate 16,000 jobs globally over the next two years. The decision, revealed by new CEO Philipp Navratil, is part of a broader effort to adapt to a changing market and increase savings targets to three billion Swiss francs by 2027. This move comes as the company reported a 1.9% decrease in nine-month sales and follows a period of internal turbulence, including the recent dismissal of its previous CEO.</p>

          <p>Malaysia's national football team is embroiled in a scandal after FIFA discovered that seven overseas-born players used false birth certificates to claim eligibility. The team has been fined $438,000, and the players have been suspended, a decision the Football Association of Malaysia intends to appeal. The incident has sparked a broader conversation across Southeast Asia about the ethics and sustainability of naturalizing foreign players to quickly improve national team performance, weighing short-term gains against long-term domestic player development.</p>

          <p>Recently published witness statements from Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins assert that China conducts "large scale espionage" and poses the "biggest state-based threat" to the UK's economic security. The documents were released after the espionage case against two men collapsed, sparking a political dispute over why the prosecution was dropped. The Conservative opposition accuses the Labour government of weakening its stance on China to protect economic ties, a claim the government denies while blaming the previous administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance during a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks, scoring 22 points. Vincent started the game on fire, hitting his first five consecutive three-point attempts and finishing with six made threes overall. Despite his strong individual effort and a solid all-around game from Jarred Vanderbilt before an injury, the Lakers ultimately fell to the Mavericks 121-94 after being heavily outscored in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man from Edinburgh, Ian Currie, has been rescued after surviving for eight days while lost in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands. He became disoriented and trapped by severe weather during what was planned as a two-day trek, with his tent and phone soaked, leaving him unable to call for help. Exhausted and suffering from exposure, he was eventually found by the local estate owner and deer stalkers after a friend had reported him missing, describing the ordeal as a "long black nightmare."</p>

          <p>The European Union's push to become a global AI hub by expanding its data center capacity is creating conflict with environmental concerns, particularly water scarcity. Building these water-intensive facilities in southern European regions like Spain and Greece, which already face significant water stress, is drawing criticism from experts and activists. While the industry is exploring innovations like using non-potable water, policymakers are being accused of prioritizing technological growth without adequately considering the environmental impact on vulnerable areas.</p>

The move targets advanced technologies, such as batteries with an energy density above 300 Wh/kg, and coincides with reports of significant Chinese advancements in solid-state battery science. Analysts view these controls as a strategic effort to protect China's dominant position in the battery industry and slow down competitors, particularly as the technology gains military importance.</p>

          <p>A new report from World Weather Attribution finds that current climate pledges under the Paris Agreement could prevent 57 deadly hot days per year compared to a scenario with no action. However, the world is still on track for at least 2.6°C of warming, far exceeding the 1.5°C target, which would still result in a dangerous increase in extreme heat events. The study emphasizes that while the agreement has steered the world away from the worst-case scenarios, much stronger and faster emissions cuts are required to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

In response, a government spokesperson stated it was "untrue" that its most secure systems had been compromised, and a former head of the National Cyber Security Centre also cast doubt on the claim.</p>
