          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has outlined new, stricter regulatory guidance for Covid-19 vaccine boosters, particularly for healthy individuals. The agency now requires new clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Covid shots before approving them for healthy adults and children. This decision reflects a shift from the previous approach of approving updated shots based on antibody response tests. The FDA will accept immunogenicity data for high-risk individuals, such as those 65 and older or with underlying health conditions, but will require randomized, controlled trials showing clinical outcomes for healthy individuals.</p>

          <p>A woman gained social media attention after bringing a whole rotisserie chicken as her carry-on luggage to eat as a mid-flight snack. Chloe Gray, a social media influencer, said she brought the chicken from Newark, New Jersey, to California as a "designer bag" to stay nourished during her trip. While TSA agents questioned her, they ultimately allowed her to proceed with the chicken, which she ate on the plane. The incident sparked mixed reactions online, with some commenters expressing amusement and others finding the strong smell of the chicken disruptive.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a two-hour phone call, their third since Trump's second term began, discussing potential trade opportunities between the United States and Russia. Trump expressed optimism about Russia's potential for job creation and wealth, while Putin emphasized the need to address the "root causes" of the war, including Ukraine's NATO aspirations and recognition of annexed regions. Analysts suggest the call focused more on bilateral economic relations rather than resolving the conflict in Ukraine, potentially stalling negotiations and favoring Russia's position on the front lines.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could be eligible for up to Â£70 each following a court ruling that deemed historic fees charged by Mastercard as unfair. The case, brought forward by Walter Merricks, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers who lived in the specified regions for at least three months during the eligibility period and purchased goods from UK businesses accepting Mastercard credit cards can claim compensation by completing an online form. Any unclaimed funds are expected to go to the company that funded the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Two new studies provide data supporting the critical role of Medicaid in saving lives, amidst ongoing political debates about potential program changes. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act led to a 21% reduction in mortality among low-income adults, saving 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022 in states that expanded the program. A New England Journal of Medicine study highlighted that Medicaid coverage, particularly the Part D Low-Income Subsidy, improves access to prescription drugs and reduces mortality among vulnerable individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.</p>

          <p>Doubts have emerged regarding the availability of EU e-gates for UK passport holders this summer, as the EU Commission indicates access will not be granted until the new Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) is implemented in October 2025. Even after the EES is in place, individual countries will have the final say on allowing UK citizens to use the e-gates. While a recent agreement between the UK and the EU removes legal barriers to e-gate use post-EES introduction, actual implementation will depend on negotiations with individual EU member states, some of which already permit UK citizens to use their e-gates.</p>

Parker distinguishes between elemental hate, which is rare and destructive, and petty hate, which is becoming more common due to psychic atomization. He suggests detaching from negativity, unplugging from technology, and practicing kindness to combat hate. Additionally, Parker defends the overuse of the word "existential," arguing that it reflects the consequential times we live in and lacks good synonyms.</p>

          <p>The personal secretary and an adviser to Mexico City's mayor, Clara Brugada, were killed by gunmen on a motorcycle in a central neighborhood of the capital. Brugada, a close ally of President Claudia Sheinbaum, condemned the killings as a "direct attack." Authorities are investigating the motive and reviewing surveillance footage. The shooting occurred shortly after another incident in Guanajuato, where gunmen killed seven people, including minors. While violence against politicians is common in Mexico, such incidents are rare in the capital.</p>

          <p>The European Union is preparing to impose a â‚¬2 (US$2.25) flat fee on low-value packages, primarily from China, to address challenges posed by the influx of inexpensive items. E-commerce platforms will be expected to pay the levy per parcel, removing the customs-free status of packages worth less than â‚¬150 (US$168.75) imported directly to consumers. Parcels sent to warehouses within the EU will face a lower fee of 50 cents. The EU suspects that platforms are not doing enough to ensure that products meet European standards.</p>

          <p>Liberty Steel is making a last-ditch effort to prevent its plants in Rotherham and Sheffield from closing, potentially putting 1,450 jobs at risk. A court could force the company's speciality steel business to close due to unpaid debts unless Liberty wins an adjournment. The company says it is in discussions with creditors, but government sources indicate they are not prepared to step in to pay off outstanding debts. Creditors have petitioned the court to liquidate the company to sell assets and recover money owed.</p>

          <p>The FDA has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The agency will require randomized, placebo-controlled trials before approving shots for healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. The FDA's new leadership is criticizing the U.S. for adopting a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters and citing poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.</p>

          <p>Walmart's decision to publicly warn that President Donald Trump's tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers has sparked controversy, especially after downplaying the impact previously. The company's CFO cited that the magnitude of tariff increases are more than any retailer can absorb, leading to a direct social media response from Trump to "EAT THE TARIFFS." This move highlights the delicate balance businesses face in navigating customer, shareholder, and White House relations amidst ever-changing trade policies. This is not about speculation, this is strictly if the article is actively trying to make a financial recommendation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With retirement planning becoming more challenging, annuities, which convert a lump sum into monthly payments, are gaining traction. A $25,000 annuity's monthly payout varies based on age, gender, and annuity type. For immediate annuities, men around 62 years old can expect about $104.74 per month, while women can expect about $92.72 per month. Whether a $25,000 annuity is worthwhile depends on individual goals, with its value as a supplemental income stream weighed against limited liquidity and potential growth. (not investment advice)</p>
