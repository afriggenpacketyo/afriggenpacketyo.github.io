          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms that the court has shifted politically and is enabling an expansion of executive power. She asserted that she decides cases based on legal questions rather than political labels and must tune out external criticism from both the right and left. Discussing her new book, "Listening to the Law," Barrett reflected on the Dobbs decision, stating it returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process, and refrained from commenting on specific pending cases regarding presidential powers, emphasizing the need for a judge to maintain an open mind until a case is fully presented.</p>

          <p>The governments of South Korea and the United States have reached an agreement to secure the release of hundreds of migrant workers who were detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant under construction in Georgia. Homeland Security Investigations reported that 475 individuals, primarily from South Korea and present in the U.S. illegally, were arrested in the operation. For its part, Hyundai stated that none of the people detained were directly employed by the automotive company. The deal marks a significant diplomatic resolution following the enforcement action at the facility.</p>

The winning tickets were purchased in Missouri and Texas, ending a three-month period without a grand prize winner. The winning numbers drawn were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The jackpot had grown after 41 consecutive drawings failed to produce a winner, with this drawing setting a new record for the longest streak. Winners can choose between an annuitized prize paid over 29 years or a lump sum cash payment estimated at $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The natural shifting of the Amazon River is threatening to leave Colombia's only port town, Leticia, landlocked, which is escalating a historic border dispute with Peru. Drought and sedimentation are causing the river to move southward, away from Colombia and into Peruvian territory. This change jeopardizes Leticia's critical river access, which is essential for trade and supplies, as the town has no highway connections to the rest of the country.

          <p>Four senior physicians who recently resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly criticized new vaccine policies implemented under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They expressed grave concerns that the administration is undermining the nation's public health infrastructure and compromising scientific integrity. The doctors specifically argued that new CDC recommendations restricting COVID vaccine eligibility for children and pregnant women are not based on evidence agreed upon by world experts. Their resignations and public statements highlight a growing rift between public health officials and the administration's approach to vaccination and scientific guidance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed a breakthrough method for removing microplastics from wastewater using a specially engineered hydrogel. This innovative material acts as an autonomous shuttle, sinking to collect microplastic particles from deep water and then floating back to the surface where the pollutants can be treated and removed. The hydrogel's movement is self-regulating, driven by its own chemical properties as it captures and releases gas, creating a continuous purification cycle. Researchers believe this buoyancy-driven system is broadly adaptable and could be used to remediate other environmental threats beyond microplastics, opening new pathways for sustainable pollution removal.</p>

          <p>Five humanitarian aid workers are on trial in Poland, accused of human trafficking for providing emergency assistance to an Iraqi-Kurdish family near the Belarusian border in 2022. The case highlights the severe consequences of Europe's stringent border policies, which have led to the criminalization of providing aid to migrants. The defense argues the workers were acting out of human decency to save a starving family from the illegal practice of pushbacks, while the prosecution claims they deliberately undermined Poland's migration policy. The trial has drawn significant media attention as it coincides with EU leaders praising Poland's border security measures.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 890 people at a demonstration opposing the UK government's decision to proscribe the group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. The majority of arrests were for showing support for a banned organization, while others were for offenses including assaults on police officers after the protest reportedly turned violent. The government banned Palestine Action in July, making membership or support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Protest organizers, Defend Our Juries, condemned the police response as violent and stated the mass arrests demonstrate that the ban is unenforceable and a waste of resources.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits is the most critical action new parents can take to foster their children's long-term health and success. Known as "sleep hygiene," these practices are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional development, impacting everything from cognitive function to emotional regulation later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with white noise and swaddling, rather than complete silence. He also suggests that routines should be flexible and that non-breastfeeding partners can play a key role in settling the baby, helping to build resilient sleep patterns from infancy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that solar energy should be embraced by right-wing preppers and conservatives, not for environmental reasons, but for its alignment with principles of self-sufficiency and independence. While fossil fuels require complex, vulnerable supply chains, a solar panel and battery system offers a resilient, long-term power source that is disconnected from any grid, making it ideal for surviving societal disruptions. The author argues that solar power is the ultimate energy for hyper-individualists, providing a simple, durable, and decentralized source of power that makes a home a true, defensible castle. The piece calls for bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles for solar installation.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals a sharp partisan divide over President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities. Supporters, largely within his Republican base, believe the action reduces crime and makes them feel safer, and they would endorse similar deployments elsewhere. Conversely, opponents, mostly Democrats, feel the move threatens their rights and freedoms, see it as ineffective against crime, and believe the president's motives are more political than security-oriented. The poll also found that Trump's overall approval has stabilized slightly, as his base prioritizes his immigration and crime policies over economic concerns like inflation.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down, succumbing to mounting pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) following a significant defeat in July's parliamentary election. Ishiba, who took office last October, had initially resisted calls to resign, citing the need for political stability amidst key national challenges. The ruling coalition's failure to secure a majority in the upper house, combined with a previous loss in the lower house, severely weakened his government. His resignation preempts a party vote that was widely seen as a no-confidence motion, paving the way for an LDP leadership election in early October.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's rhetoric reveals his increasing and frequent use of phrases like "never seen anything like it" to describe events, policies, and outcomes. This signature hyperbole is not just a verbal tic but reflects a worldview where everything is presented in extreme, black-and-white terms, casting himself as a historic hero and his opponents as unprecedented villains. According to a database of presidential remarks, Trump's use of such phrases has surged this year compared to previous years in office. This communication style, which often exaggerates both successes and crises, translates into his governance, justifying extreme responses to what he frames as unprecedented situations.</p>

While China is adding record amounts of solar power, its grid faces challenges with curtailment, where clean energy is generated but cannot be used, and instability from intermittent sources like hydropower. In this context, coal plants function as a crucial backup or "shock absorber," ensuring grid stability during peak demand and preventing blackouts. This allows grid operators the confidence to continue connecting unprecedented levels of new renewables without risking the energy supply.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, a Christian text, following a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious reading. This stance is being contrasted with his actions in 2017, when his office expressed formal concern over a Dallas-area school providing a room for Muslim students to pray. Critics accuse Paxton of promoting a specific brand of Christian nationalism that violates the constitutional separation of church and state. They argue his actions show a clear preference for Christianity over other faiths, aiming to indoctrinate children rather than protect religious freedom for all students.</p>

          <p>Former officials and experts have described the process used by the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), William Pulte, to criminally refer Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for mortgage fraud as highly unusual and "bizarre." Typically, such investigations and referrals are handled by the agency's independent Office of Inspector General, not the director. Pulte accused Cook of misrepresenting her primary residence on mortgage applications, allegations her lawyers call a "clerical error." The move is seen by many as politically motivated, as it provides a basis for President Trump's attempts to remove Cook from the Federal Reserve board.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political science experts are skeptical of President Trump's recent proposal to support Chinese students, viewing it as a strategic negotiation tactic rather than a genuine policy shift. Professor Dennis Lu-Chung Weng of Sam Houston State University suggests the move is likely intended to create a more positive atmosphere ahead of a potential meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He cautions that the overall political climate in the U.S. remains highly skeptical towards China, and there are currently no signs that visa procedures for students will be streamlined. The proposal is seen as part of a broader, transactional approach to U.S.-China relations.</p>

          <p>The first human case of a New World screwworm infection in the U.S. in over 50 years is highlighting a larger threat to the American agricultural sector. The parasitic fly, which lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals, had been eradicated in the U.S. and held back by a sterile-fly barrier in Panama. However, this barrier has weakened, allowing the parasite to resurge through Central America and into Mexico, causing over a billion dollars in losses to the Mexican cattle industry. An outbreak in the U.S. could be devastating, with experts warning that climate change and industrial farming practices could accelerate its spread.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has expressed concern about the "balance" of the UK's Labour cabinet following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Rayner's departure triggered a major reshuffle, which saw key allies of Prime Minister Keir Starmer appointed to top positions. Burnham suggested the upcoming contest for the separate role of deputy party leader should be an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and direction. He advocated for a candidate from the north of England to counter a perceived "London centricity" and called for a more inclusive leadership style that doesn't punish MPs who disagree with government plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Donald Trump's second-term economic policies are increasingly mirroring the Peronist model of Argentina, characterized by personal dealmaking and significant government control over private enterprise. This approach includes an "import substitution" strategy using high tariffs to protect domestic industries, direct government stakes in major corporations like Intel and U.S. Steel, and attempts to influence the Federal Reserve. The article warns that this centralization of economic power, often enacted through emergency declarations, risks creating an economy dependent on political favors rather than market principles, potentially leading to long-term instability and cronyism.

          <p>Despite massive investment and soaring stock valuations for tech giants, evidence suggests that artificial intelligence is not yet delivering the expected real-world productivity gains, raising fears of an AI bubble. A recent rigorous study found experienced software developers were actually slower when using AI tools, highlighting a gap between capability and reliability. With the stock market's growth heavily reliant on a few AI-focused companies that are spending far more than they earn from the technology, a collapse in investor confidence could trigger a market crash more severe than the dot-com bust, potentially leading to a broader economic recession.

This follows a trend of increasing global acknowledgment, with 147 of 193 UN members already recognizing Palestine. While a General Assembly resolution can confer symbolic status, full UN membership requires a recommendation from the Security Council, where the U.S. has previously used its veto power to block such a move.

          <p>Following the recent $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, a data analysis shows how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize due to varying state tax laws. While all winnings are subject to a 37% federal tax, some states impose additional income taxes, while others do not. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep the most money. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. This breakdown highlights the considerable financial difference for winners depending on where the lucky ticket was purchased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, has been convicted for a second time of murdering her husband, Todd Stermer, in a case dating back to 2007. Prosecutors argued she intentionally set their house on fire and then ran him over with a van as he escaped the flames. Her initial conviction was overturned by a federal judge in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective legal counsel, leading to her release after nearly nine years in prison. Despite her defense team arguing a lack of scientific evidence for arson and suggesting the fire was accidental, a new jury found her guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, sending her back to prison for life.</p>

After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his IPL commitments, he lost his spot in the starting XI and only returned for the final match against India.

          <p>Nine attorneys representing approximately 50 survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse claim they have not been contacted by the Department of Justice, casting doubt on the Trump administration's commitment to a full investigation. This lack of outreach comes more than six months after President Trump vowed transparency and to get to the bottom of Epstein's crimes. The lawyers find it appalling that the government appears to be ignoring victims, especially while officials have engaged in lengthy interviews with convicted trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. This failure to engage with survivors undermines the credibility of the investigation and fuels criticism that the administration is not serious about uncovering the full truth.</p>
