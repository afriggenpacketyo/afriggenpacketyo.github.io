          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected jobs report, President Donald Trump has publicly called for the immediate dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. In a social media post, Trump accused the commissioner, a Biden-era appointee, of manipulating data to harm his administration's image before the election. The demand comes after the BLS reported only 73,000 new jobs in July and significantly revised down the previous two months' figures, sparking criticism from the president about the data's integrity. This move intensifies the administration's scrutiny of federal economic reporting agencies.</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system, ordering the company to pay $329 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Naibel Benavides, who was killed, and Dillon Angulo, who was severely injured when a Model S using Enhanced Autopilot accelerated through an intersection and struck them. The driver claimed he believed the system would automatically brake for obstacles. This verdict represents a significant legal setback for Tesla as it pursues its vision for autonomous robotaxi fleets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be moved to "appropriate regions" following what he termed "highly provocative" statements from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The move is a direct response to a war of words on social media, where Medvedev threatened the U.S. over Trump's ultimatum regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump stated the deployment is a precautionary measure in case the inflammatory rhetoric leads to unintended consequences, escalating geopolitical tensions between the two nuclear powers. The White House has not specified the submarines' new locations.</p>

          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein have expressed outrage after his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, was transferred from a Florida facility to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. In a joint statement, victims Annie and Maria Farmer, along with the family of the late Virginia Giuffre, called the move preferential treatment and a "cover up." The transfer occurred shortly after Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who is also a former defense lawyer for President Trump. This development has fueled speculation about potential leniency or a future pardon for Maxwell, drawing sharp criticism from her accusers.</p>

          <p>Joby Aviation has partnered with defense contractor L3Harris to create a next-generation military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The collaboration will integrate Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The new craft will be based on Joby's S4 design but will use a gas turbine instead of being fully electric, targeting applications like surveillance and logistics in contested environments. This partnership reflects a broader military trend toward smaller, more adaptable, and autonomous aerial support vehicles for modern battlefield operations.</p>

The new facility houses fewer inmates and is considered less restrictive, prompting condemnation from accusers who view it as preferential treatment. The move follows a recent meeting between Maxwell and a top Justice Department official to discuss the Jeffrey Epstein case, raising questions about her potential cooperation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended approximately 300 federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), totaling nearly $200 million. The university announced that the funding freeze, affecting agencies like the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health, was enacted due to claims of on-campus antisemitism. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk criticized the decision, stating the penalty defunds life-saving research and does not address the alleged discrimination. This action follows a recent Justice Department finding that UCLA was "deliberately indifferent" to a hostile environment for Jewish students during campus protests.</p>

          <p>Google has removed more than 50 organizations related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from a public list of groups receiving significant contributions, according to a report by The Tech Transparency Project. This purge is part of a broader shift in which Google has cut 214 groups from the list while adding 101 new ones. The move aligns with a larger corporate and political trend of scaling back DEI initiatives, influenced by cost-cutting measures, a focus on AI, and the current administration's opposition to such programs. Google stated the list reflects 2024 contributions and is not exhaustive of all its corporate giving.</p>

CPB leadership stated that most staff positions will be eliminated by the end of the fiscal year, with a small transition team remaining until January 2026.

          <p>After several weeks of relatively mild weather, Southern California is bracing for a significant heatwave next week, with temperatures expected to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the valleys. Meteorologists from the National Weather Service attribute the temperature spike to a high-pressure system moving in from the southwest, replacing the cooler Pacific Northwest system that dominated July. While the heat will be 5 to 10 degrees above normal, widespread strong winds are not anticipated, which may lower the immediate risk of major wildfires. Authorities are advising residents to stay hydrated and take precautions against heat-related illnesses.</p>

International organizations like the UN and Human Rights Watch have raised alarms about mass starvation and civilian casualties near these militarized aid points.

The Trump administration justified the 50% tariffs and sanctions by citing the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, which Justice de Moraes is overseeing. Analysts suggest the actions are politically and ideologically motivated, serving as a direct attack on a democratic ally and reflecting tensions over Brazil's ties with China.

The court found that car dealers did not have a fiduciary duty to put customers' interests above their own.

          <p>A Senate committee has unanimously advanced a bipartisan bill designed to tackle the nation's housing affordability crisis. The "ROAD to Housing Act of 2025," co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren, includes provisions to boost housing supply, reduce homelessness, and expand homeownership access. Key measures include simplifying the construction of manufactured homes and permanently authorizing a disaster recovery grant program to help communities rebuild after natural disasters. While hailed as a significant step, experts note the package is not a panacea and its provisions are primarily aimed at facilitating long-term supply growth.</p>

          <p>As more nations move to recognize Palestine, the article explores the complex criteria and political realities that define a state in international law. According to the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a state must have a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into international relations. However, recognition by other nations and admission to the United Nations are crucial for a state to function effectively on the global stage. The process for UN membership is fraught with political hurdles, particularly the requirement for approval from all five permanent Security Council members, which has so far blocked full membership for Palestine.</p>

          <p>An American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited a culture war over a simple pun. The ads, which play on the homophones "jeans" and "genes," have been accused by some social media critics of being a "Nazi dog whistle" promoting eugenics. The article argues this interpretation is a distraction from more overt instances of xenophobic messaging, such as recent social media posts from the Department of Homeland Security celebrating Manifest Destiny. The controversy highlights a tendency to politicize trivial matters while overlooking more substantive issues, turning a basic marketing concept into a polarized debate.</p>

          <p>Two Federal Reserve Governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have publicly explained their dissenting votes against the central bank's decision to hold interest rates steady. In separate statements, both argued for a quarter-point rate reduction, asserting that the inflationary impact of tariffs is temporary and that delaying policy easing poses a significant risk to the labor market and economic growth. Their statements, released just before a weak jobs report, represent a rare public disagreement among Fed governors and highlight a growing debate within the central bank about the appropriate path for monetary policy.

Directors Ari Mark and Phil Lott were motivated to tell the story to seek justice for Bradley's family, who they say live with constant pain but hold onto hope.

          <p>A single lightning flash that stretched an astonishing 515 miles from eastern Texas to Missouri in 2017 has been officially recognized as a new world record for the longest horizontal distance. This continuous horizontal discharge, known as a "megaflash," was documented using new satellite technology that allowed for a more precise analysis of the storm. The previous record, set in 2020, was 477 miles long. While this megaflash holds the record for distance, it did not break the record for duration, lasting just over seven seconds. Scientists anticipate that improving technology will allow them to identify even greater lightning extremes in the future.</p>

The museum stated the removal is a temporary measure pending a more substantial overhaul of the entire exhibit, which had not been significantly updated since 2008. The Smithsonian confirmed that a future, updated version of the exhibit will include all presidential impeachments but provided no timeline for the changes. This decision follows recent White House criticism of the Smithsonian for what it termed "divisive, DEI exhibits" and a push to remove perceived ideology from museums.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has indicated he may call a special election in November to ask voters for the power to redraw the state's congressional maps. This move is a direct response to potential mid-decade redistricting efforts in Republican-led states like Texas, which aim to secure a GOP majority in the House of Representatives. To counter this, California Democrats would first need voter approval to alter the authority of the state's independent redistricting commission, established in 2010. Newsom framed the potential action as a necessary response to partisan gerrymandering, stating the need to "fight fire with fire."</p>
