          <p>The State Department is planning a significant reorganization, aiming to reduce its domestic workforce by approximately 3,400 positions and consolidate nearly half of its domestic offices. This initiative, part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government, seeks to create a more agile department better equipped to promote America's interests. The reorganization includes merging some departments focused on democracy and human rights, with a new senior job focused on "Democracy & Western Values." The plan also eliminates a program tasked with helping relocate Afghans who assisted U.S. military personnel during the war in Afghanistan, drawing criticism from veterans' groups. The administration intends to shutter most of the U.S. Agency for International Development, folding its foreign aid duties into the State Department.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the agency's remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused the crypto exchange of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This development marks a significant turn in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges. It is unclear why the SEC decided to drop the lawsuit, but it could signal a shift in the agency's approach to crypto regulation or a reassessment of the strength of its case against Binance. </p>

Littler initially took a 3-0 lead, but Humphries rallied to level the score and ultimately dominate the match with impressive darting. Despite Littler's strong performance throughout the campaign, setting a points record and claiming six nightly wins, he was unable to maintain his early lead. Both players displayed nerves, but Humphries found his rhythm after the break, securing the win with a double 10 finish. Despite his loss, Littler expressed satisfaction with his runner-up position and vowed to return next year, while Humphries and Littler are set to team up for England at the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt in June.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 17:41:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that oceans worldwide have darkened over the past two decades, raising concerns for marine life. Satellite data indicates that 21% of the planetâ€™s oceans have darkened between 2003 and 2022, impacting the photic zones where most marine life thrives. This darkening may cause creatures that rely on light to move closer to the surface, potentially creating cramped living spaces. Global warming and changes in ocean currents are thought to contribute to this phenomenon, though some areas have become lighter. The study predicts severe implications for marine food webs, global fisheries, and carbon and nutrient budgets.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on imported goods have been ruled illegal by the U.S. Court of International Trade, but a federal appeals court temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies for now. The ruling, which deemed the tariffs unauthorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), has created uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers. While the administration appeals, it could also explore alternative routes to impose tariffs, such as Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 or Section 232 tariffs. Several lawsuits are challenging the tariffs, including one from a toy company, adding to the legal complexities. The situation remains fluid, with businesses facing uncertainty until the appeals process concludes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated President Trump's tariffs, suspending a lower court's ruling that deemed them illegal, escalating the legal battle over the duties. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations. The legal challenge centers on whether Trump overstepped his power by imposing the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The appeals court's decision keeps the tariffs in place for now, but the broader questions of the case will continue to be litigated. The White House remains committed to tariffs, even if the appeal is lost, suggesting alternative measures may be pursued.</p>

          <p>Malibu has contracted a private security firm to patrol fire-damaged areas, following devastating wildfires that struck the region. The patrols will supplement the Los Angeles sheriffâ€™s office to address heightened risks of burglary, vandalism, and theft in vacant properties. The security measures coincide with the reopening of the Pacific Coast Highway, a key milestone in the area's recovery. Looting has been a persistent concern for residents since the fires, which caused significant damage and loss of life. The city aims to ensure public safety during the critical rebuilding phase.</p>

          <p>Costco reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, driven by an 8% increase in sales. The warehouse club retailer's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, with comparable sales up 8% and e-commerce sales rising nearly 16%. Costco's competitive pricing and bulk discounts could benefit from economic uncertainties and potential tariff increases. The company's strong hand in price negotiations with suppliers further positions it favorably. Costco does not provide an annual outlook but is expected to share more details on its earnings call.</p>

          <p>The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a federal lawsuit against the White House, alleging a lack of American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters at press briefings. The lawsuit claims the White House stopped providing ASL interpreters when President Trump returned to office, violating the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as well as the First and Fifth Amendments. The NAD argues that English closed captioning is insufficient for many deaf and hard of hearing individuals who primarily communicate in ASL. The lawsuit seeks to require ASL interpreters at public events and that video of them be available for viewers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure in the Trump administration, lasting 129 days, concluded with significant impacts on the federal government. As part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk aimed to cut government spending, claiming $175 billion in savings through various measures, though the evidence supporting these figures has been debated. His presence in the White House raised ethical concerns due to potential conflicts of interest with his companies. Musk's work with DOGE also led to the elimination of many USAID programs, aligning with the administration's "America First" approach, and he faced criticism for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation.</p>
