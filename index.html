          <p>President Donald Trump used his social media platform to criticize Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they attended China's military parade in Beijing. Trump accused Xi of "conspiring against" the United States during the parade, which commemorated the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. He also emphasized America's support for China during World War II, hoping Xi would acknowledge it in his remarks. Xi hailed the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a "heroic force" and advocated for nations treating each other as equals. The gathering of Kim, Xi, and Putin occurred amid concerns over their collaboration in supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with accusations of North Korea supplying ammunition and China providing vital materiel and economic support to Moscow. The article reflects the complex geopolitical dynamics and tensions between the United States, China, Russia, and North Korea. </p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Blocks Trump's Use of Alien Enemies Act for Venezuelan Migrant Deportations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 23:57:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants, asserting that there is "no invasion or predatory incursion." The Trump administration had been using this obscure law to deport alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, some of whom were later transferred to a supermax prison in El Salvador. The court found that encouraging illegal immigration does not equate to an armed, organized force harming the United States. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, preventing the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove the migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas, although the government can still deport them under other legal avenues. The article focuses on the legal challenges to the Trump administration's immigration policies and the court's decision to limit the use of the Alien Enemies Act. </p>
