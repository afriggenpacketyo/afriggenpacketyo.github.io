        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has acknowledged that an air traffic controller at Reagan National Airport failed to properly warn a commercial airliner about a nearby Army helicopter before a fatal collision that killed 67 people. Testimony at an NTSB hearing revealed that controllers were overwhelmed by high traffic volume, often using risky procedures to manage takeoffs and landings. The controller involved was juggling communications with 21 aircraft in the 10 minutes preceding the crash, highlighting systemic issues of understaffing and pressure at the airport. These factors contributed to the catastrophic event over the Potomac River.</p>

          <p>Annual tuition fees for undergraduate degrees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. The government stated the hike is in line with inflation, while universities have argued it is necessary to address significant funding pressures. Maintenance loans for student living costs have also seen a small increase, but student advocacy groups warn it is insufficient to cover soaring accommodation and living expenses. The change comes as many universities face financial deficits, potentially leading to cuts in staffing and courses for students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite having a losing record and low playoff odds, the Los Angeles Angels opted to be "buyers" at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring several veteran players rather than trading assets to rebuild. General Manager Perry Minasian defended the decision, stating the goal is to foster a competitive environment for the team's young core by playing meaningful games in August and September. However, critics view the moves as insufficient to make a real playoff push and a missed opportunity to acquire prospects for the future. The strategy reflects owner Arte Moreno's long-standing resistance to a full rebuild for the team.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the executive mansion grounds, with a projected cost of $200 million. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the project will be funded by President Trump and other "patriot donors," describing it as a "gift to the country." The new building, which will replace the current East Wing, is intended to host large-scale events that currently require outdoor tents. This represents the first major structural addition to the White House since 1948 and reflects the president's background in real estate development.</p>

          <p>Following a highly successful initial public offering, design software company Figma's stock surged, creating approximately $24 billion in value for its primary venture capital backers, including Index Ventures and Sequoia. The company's market debut was a significant event for Silicon Valley, which has seen a slow IPO market in recent years. Figma's valuation soared to nearly $68 billion, more than triple the $20 billion Adobe had offered in a failed acquisition attempt that was blocked by regulators. The successful offering is seen as a positive sign for the tech industry, potentially encouraging more companies to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the implementation has been delayed by seven days, pushing the effective date to August 7th for most nations, giving customs officials time to prepare. The order specifies rates for partners with and without trade deals, while Canada faces a separate, immediate hike to 35%. This move concludes a period of intense negotiations and uncertainty, reshaping U.S. trade relationships globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire victim compensation fund, which is at risk of being exhausted by claims from recent deadly fires. The proposal would source half the money from the state's three largest utilities and the other half from their customers, likely by extending a monthly surcharge on electricity bills for another decade. The original $21 billion fund, created in 2019, is facing depletion far sooner than anticipated due to the increasing frequency and destructiveness of wildfires. The plan has drawn criticism from both consumer advocates and utility executives.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell proposes that the modern potato evolved from an ancestor of the tomato approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers solved the long-standing puzzle of the potato's origin by analyzing hundreds of potato genomes. They found that a hybridization event between an ancient tomato species and a wild, non-tuber-producing potato relative from Chile created the starchy vegetable we know today. A key gene from the tomato parent was responsible for initiating tuber formation, demonstrating how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has uncovered a covert shipping operation, known as a "dark fleet," that China is using to purchase oil from Iran in defiance of U.S. sanctions. The process involves ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers turning off their transponders and obscuring their names to avoid detection. This illicit trade, estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, props up the regime and undermines international efforts to curb its nuclear program.

          <p>Following the death of a 79-year-old woman in a car crash, her family is calling for an overhaul of the UK's "unsafe and inadequate" rules for older drivers. Currently, drivers must self-renew their license at age 70 and every three years after, with a legal duty to self-report medical conditions that affect driving. Critics argue this system is insufficient, as many are unaware of their obligations or reluctant to give up their independence. They advocate for mandatory medical checks and a legal requirement for doctors to report unfit patients, as statistics show a higher risk for drivers over 75.</p>

          <h2>Explainer on Chikungunya Fever as Cases Surge in Southern China</h2>

          <p>A significant surge in Chikungunya fever cases in China's southern Guangdong province, with over 5,000 infections reported recently, has prompted the U.S. CDC to consider issuing a travel notice. Chikungunya is a virus transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and it is not typically found in the region. The most common symptoms are high fever and severe joint pain, which can be debilitating and last for months or even years. While rarely fatal, the rapid spread of the mosquito-borne illness is causing public health concern and highlights the risk of emerging infectious diseases.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 20:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two of southern China's most critical economic engines, are reporting underperforming GDP growth, signaling a potential slowdown. The relative decline is attributed to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and a downturn in the domestic property market, which has dampened investment. In Shenzhen, fixed-asset investment and real estate development have seen significant year-on-year drops. This simultaneous deceleration in two of the country's most dynamic cities raises concerns about broader economic headwinds and has prompted calls for stronger government action to support businesses.

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has revealed that he was battling a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. In a candid social media post, the 44-year-old singer explained that the diagnosis helped him understand the severe nerve pain and fatigue he was experiencing on stage. He decided to continue with the tour to prove his "mental tenacity" rather than cancel shows. Lyme disease is a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks, with symptoms that can include joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue, which can be treated with antibiotics.</p>

          <p>Social media companies like X and Reddit are broadly restricting content, including news about the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and UK parliamentary debates, in an effort to comply with the new Online Safety Act. The legislation, which took effect last week, requires platforms to protect minors from harmful material or face massive fines. However, experts warn that companies are over-blocking, stifling public interest debate by restricting content for any user who has not verified their age. This has led to criticism that the law's implementation is censoring legitimate discussion and journalism.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant policy change to its main civil service internship scheme, restricting eligibility exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The new rule, effective from 2026, will use parental occupation as the primary metric for determining an applicant's background. Successful interns will then be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program into the civil service. The reform, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class communities and ensure Whitehall better reflects the country it serves.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is considering a November 4th special election to have voters approve newly drawn congressional maps. This move is a direct response to President Trump's call for Republican-led states to redistrict in their favor ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Newsom's plan would have the legislature create new maps, which would then be presented to voters for approval, temporarily bypassing the state's independent redistricting commission until 2030. The governor framed the potential gerrymandering as a necessary defensive measure to counter what he calls a "rigged game" and protect Democratic chances of retaking the House.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Edward Zakrzewski for the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children, marking the ninth execution in the state this year. This total sets a new single-year record for Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. Zakrzewski's execution proceeded after the Supreme Court rejected his final appeal. Opponents had highlighted his military service and the non-unanimous 7-5 jury recommendation for his death sentence, a verdict that would not be sufficient for a death sentence under current Florida law. The state has two more executions scheduled for August.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions like reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call. This contrasted sharply with other National League contenders, such as the San Diego Padres and New York Mets, who made significant blockbuster trades to bolster their teams. The Dodgers' front office signaled its strategy beforehand, expressing strong faith in their current talented roster to improve internally. The team is betting that the return of injured players and better performance from slumping stars will be enough to defend their World Series title.</p>
