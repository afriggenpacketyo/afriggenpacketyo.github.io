          <p>The Trump administration has formally stated its intention to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador if his immigration case is reopened, according to court filings. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to a mega-prison despite a 2019 court order protecting him, and was later returned to the U.S. to face unrelated charges. His lawyers are seeking to reopen his case to apply for asylum, while the government argues he is an MS-13 gang member and therefore ineligible, a claim his family denies.</p>

Armani revolutionized office attire with the softly tailored "power suit" for both men and women, and pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements on the red carpet, cementing his brand's global influence and legacy of accessible, quiet luxury.</p>

          <p>A crime crackdown in Washington D.C., initiated by President Trump, has resulted in 1,914 arrests since early August, involving hundreds of National Guard members and various federal agencies. Recent arrests include an illegal immigrant on a terrorist watchlist and a person of interest connected to a gun found on school property, with law enforcement also recovering missing children. The White House has praised the operation for removing dangerous criminals and restoring order, though the strategy has drawn criticism from other city leaders for federal overreach.</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. unemployment data, which showed a slight increase to 4.3% and weaker-than-expected job growth, could prompt the Federal Reserve to implement a more significant interest rate cut. A cooling labor market often leads the central bank to stimulate the economy by lowering rates, which in turn reduces borrowing costs for consumers. As a result, prospective homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance may see mortgage rates, which recently hit an 11-month low, fall even further in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who tried to shut down a passenger plane's engines last year, has pleaded guilty in federal court as part of a plea agreement.

The plea deal includes recommendations for probation, extensive community service, and restitution to the airline, as he aims to avoid additional prison time for his actions.</p>

The regulator found that Google unfairly favored its own ad exchange, AdX, over rivals, which harmed competitors and publishers by creating higher costs and reducing revenues. Google has been ordered to end these anti-competitive practices and has stated its intention to appeal the decision, calling the fine unjustified. This action represents one of the largest penalties the EU has ever imposed on a tech company for such breaches.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online activities like shopping is not a sackable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spy software to track her computer usage. The ruling noted that the time spent was not "excessive," the company had no clear policy against it, and the dismissal appeared timed to prevent her from reaching two years of service, which grants stronger unfair dismissal rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threats to deploy the National Guard to major U.S. cities are being met with starkly different reactions from local and state leaders. Democratic officials in Chicago and Baltimore have vehemently opposed the idea, citing falling crime rates and decrying it as an illegal political stunt and federal overreach. In contrast, Louisiana's Republican governor has welcomed potential federal assistance for New Orleans, creating a complex political and legal landscape as the administration continues to weigh using military troops for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock plunged 20% after the company drastically cut its full-year earnings outlook, surprising Wall Street. The athletic apparel maker attributed the lowered forecast to a projected $240 million negative impact from President Trump's trade tariffs, as well as struggles with its product offerings. The CEO admitted that the brand's casual wear has become "stale" and predictable, failing to resonate with customers and contributing to a slowdown in sales growth, particularly in the Americas.

          <p>The reunion of the iconic British rock band Oasis is generating a level of excitement in Los Angeles typically reserved for major pop acts, with a sold-out show at the Rose Bowl this weekend. The event has inspired a city-wide celebration among Anglophiles, with tribute bands, themed parties, and merchandise pop-ups drawing huge crowds. For many fans, the tour represents a refreshing return to live-wire rock and roll and a welcome distraction, fostering a sense of communal joy and nostalgia that has been absent for the 15 years since the band's acrimonious split.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved legislation that raises the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This move quadruples the $10,000 limit that was established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The change is a significant tax break for residents of high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who were disproportionately affected by the previous cap, though it is projected to add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.

          <p>The U.S. vaccine infrastructure is fracturing as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismantles key scientific bodies, such as the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). By replacing experts with anti-vaccine figures, the administration has eroded trust in federal guidance, compelling several states and major medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue their own, separate vaccine recommendations. This unprecedented split threatens decades of synchronized public health policy and could lead to a patchwork of immunization standards across the country, increasing risks of disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," its pre-1947 name. The administration argues the name has a "stronger sound" and reflects a time when the U.S. consistently won wars. Historians note the name was changed to "Defense" after World War II to signal a strategic shift toward deterring major conflicts in the nuclear age. Critics worry that reverting the name implies a more bellicose foreign policy and a departure from the goal of preventing large-scale wars.</p>

McNulty, who died by suicide in 1997, was linked to the cases through investigative genealogy and a biological sample from a previous investigation, finally bringing a measure of closure to his victims.</p>
