          <p>The S&P 500 and other major indices experienced a significant drop after the White House hinted at President Trump announcing new tariffs on auto imports.  This protectionist trade policy is expected to increase vehicle costs for consumers and negatively impact the auto sector, causing further economic disruption and potentially higher inflation. <i></i><br>(not investment advice)<i></i></p>

          <p>In a rare decision, the Supreme Court upheld a federal regulation targeting ghost guns, defying its typical expansive view of gun rights. The court rejected the argument that unassembled gun kits are exempt from serial number and background check requirements, clarifying the application of existing laws to these weapons.  However, the ruling leaves open the possibility of future challenges based on specific cases.</p>
