          <p>A man is in custody after a stabbing incident at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, left eleven people wounded. Officials report that the attack, which occurred near the store's checkout area, appears to have been random. The 42-year-old suspect allegedly used a folding knife and was apprehended with assistance from citizens inside the store. All eleven victims were transported to a local medical center, with six reported to be in critical condition and five in serious condition. Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Walmart have both issued statements condemning the violence and expressing gratitude to first responders.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration names RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president and directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government. This development raises fears of a permanent division of Sudan, with the army controlling the north and east while the RSF holds sway in Darfur and Kordofan. The UN has warned this action could further fragment the nation, where the conflict has already displaced 13 million people and killed an estimated 150,000.</p>

          <h2>Former Ballerina Ashley Benefield Convicted of Manslaughter in Husband's Death</h2>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter in the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. Prosecutors argued she killed him to win a bitter custody battle over their daughter, while the defense claimed she acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, including Ashley's accusations of poisoning and Doug's history of anger. Ultimately, the jury convicted her of the lesser charge rather than second-degree murder, and she was sentenced to 20 years in prison, bringing a complex and tragic case to a close.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Boston Red Sox 4-2, as pitcher Garrett Crochet effectively shut down the Dodgers' offense after a rocky start. While the Dodgers managed two solo home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández in the first inning, Crochet settled in to strike out ten batters and prevent further scoring. Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw struggled with his command, allowing four runs in 4.2 innings, including a three-run second inning.

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing about 20% of its workforce, have accepted a deferred resignation offer from the Trump administration. This reduction is part of a broader plan to shrink the federal workforce and will decrease the agency's employee count from 18,000 to 14,000. The move comes alongside a proposed 24% budget cut for the agency in fiscal year 2026, though Congress is considering keeping funding at current levels. The staff reductions and budget proposals have drawn criticism from scientific organizations like The Planetary Society, which argue the cuts undermine American leadership in space exploration.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne, many are remembering him not just as a heavy metal pioneer but also as an early 2000s reality television icon. His MTV show, "The Osbournes," which ran from 2002 to 2005, offered an unprecedented and often mundane look into the life of his famous family, pioneering the "reality sitcom" format. The show's blend of celebrity life with everyday family frustrations resonated with millions, turning the Black Sabbath frontman into a lovable, albeit chaotic, TV dad. This article explores how the show redefined celebrity access and paved the way for a new era of reality programming.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is on a fast track to Catholic sainthood after being murdered in 2007 for refusing bribes. A devout Catholic, Kositi was killed after he blocked the smuggling of spoiled rice that could have poisoned the public, turning down increasingly large bribes. The Catholic Church has declared him a martyr for dying for his Christian values, and he was recently beatified in Rome. His story is being held up as a powerful example of integrity and courage in a region plagued by corruption and conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As football fans anticipate the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions associated with watching high-stakes matches. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an increased heart rate, anxiety, and even affect sleep and behavior after the game. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and engaging in movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression, regardless of the final score.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in over 20 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, the pattern is a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. Experts note that while the start of summer has been cold, the region's hottest weather often arrives in September.</p>

Conversely, other fans have praised the ad for moving away from "woke advertising."

This authorization does not guarantee an immediate strike, as negotiations are scheduled for late July, but it empowers the union to call one if talks fail. The vote follows the company's first-ever layoffs of clerks earlier this year, which Stater Bros. attributed to inflation and tariffs.</p>

The recall effort targeted 24 opposition members accused of being "pro-China" and undermining national security by obstructing President William Lai's agenda. The opposition KMT party, which denies being pro-China, has stymied defense budgets and key appointments since gaining parliamentary control. With the recall's failure, President Lai will likely face an emboldened opposition for the remainder of his term, complicating governance amid rising pressure from Beijing.</p>
