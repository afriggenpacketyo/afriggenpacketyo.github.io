          <p>Sheffield Wednesday is embroiled in a severe financial crisis, with owner Dejphon Chansiri demanding an unrealistic £100 million for the club, significantly above its estimated market value. This prolonged takeover deadlock has fueled fan protests and boycotts, aiming to pressure Chansiri into a sale. The English Football League is actively investigating the club's financial irregularities, including delayed payments, which could result in a substantial points deduction and potential relegation. Despite interest from potential investors like John Textor, the club's precarious situation continues to generate uncertainty regarding its future stability.</p>

          <p>England flanker Abi Burton has completed an extraordinary journey, making her Rugby World Cup debut three years after emerging from a medically-induced coma. Diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, a rare condition where her immune system attacked her brain, Burton spent nearly four weeks comatose and initially lost the ability to walk, talk, read, and write. Through intensive rehabilitation, she defied expectations, returning to professional rugby with Trailfinders Women and the Great Britain Sevens team. Her inspiring story, shared with her emotional family, underscores immense resilience and determination.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open in positive territory, aiming to recover from previous session's negative sentiment caused by regional fiscal concerns and rising bond yields. The UK's 30-year bond yield hit its highest since 1998, and France's 30-year yield reached a 2009 peak amidst budget disputes. Globally, bond yields are rising due to concerns over former President Trump's trade tariffs, especially after a federal appeals court ruled most of his duties illegal.

          <p>The vibrant and intense atmosphere of the US Open has reignited debates surrounding on-court tennis etiquette, particularly concerning net cords and underarm serves. Incidents like Jelena Ostapenko's accusation against Taylor Townsend for not apologizing after a net-cord winner, and Stefanos Tsitsipas's reaction to an underarm serve, highlight differing views on sportsmanship. While some players, especially those from the US college system, find a lack of apology for net cords acceptable, others view certain tactics as disrespectful. This article explores how the unique energy of New York amplifies these contentious issues.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly experienced declines as investors reacted to rising global bond yields and the latest trade developments. Chinese markets were a focal point following President Xi Jinping's military parade, though the CSI 300 index still fell. Despite this, China's General Services PMI reached a 15-month high, signaling robust domestic and foreign demand. Australia's second-quarter GDP, however, exceeded expectations, marking its fastest growth since September 2023. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped, and yields on Japanese Government Bonds continued their ascent, reflecting a complex and generally bearish regional economic sentiment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has delivered a significant blow to former President Donald Trump's administration, ruling that it cannot employ the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to accelerate the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel affirmed lower court decisions, asserting the act was intended for declared wars, not for managing immigration during peacetime against groups like Tren de Aragua. This 2-1 ruling, which can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, represents a crucial legal check on the executive's power regarding immigration enforcement and wartime statutes.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy experienced stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter, with GDP expanding by 1.8% year-over-year, marking its fastest pace since September 2023.

The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates to 3.6% and adopted a more optimistic tone, noting increased clarity on global trade. Inflation also neared the RBA's target range, and consumer sentiment is picking up, suggesting a steady, though not spectacular, growth trajectory for the latter half of the year.

          <p>The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has released over 33,000 pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related records provided by the Department of Justice. However, Democratic members contend that the vast majority, around 97%, of these documents were already publicly available, with only a small portion, such as certain flight logs, offering new details. This limited disclosure has drawn criticism for not providing substantial new information, thereby intensifying public speculation about a potential cover-up.

          <p>A federal judge has delivered a significant setback to former President Donald Trump's efforts to act as a national police chief, ruling his deployment of National Guard soldiers and marines to Los Angeles as illegal. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found the operation violated an 1878 law, which bars the military from civilian law enforcement activities, effectively accusing the White House of attempting to federalize local police. This judgment challenges Trump's broader ambition to deploy federal forces to other major U.S. cities, though the ruling is currently being appealed, indicating further legal battles.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has declared his intention to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago to combat crime, stating, "We're going in," despite significant opposition from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. This announcement follows Trump's controversial use of federal forces in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, which has faced legal challenges regarding executive authority.
