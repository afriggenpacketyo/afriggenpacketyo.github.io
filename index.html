          <p>Private equity leaders at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin acknowledged a slowdown in M&A and IPO activity, impacting the industry's growth. The sector faces pressure due to geopolitical tensions, volatile public markets, and high interest rates, leading to companies staying private longer. Despite these challenges, some attendees defended private equity, highlighting growth areas like European defense firms and Middle Eastern data centers. Experts suggest that private equity has historically outperformed public markets over the long term, but some firms may have overpaid during the peak dealmaking period of 2021.

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a five-year plan to enhance the country's infrastructure resilience against disasters, allocating over 20 trillion yen (approximately $139 billion). The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and implementing measures to prevent landslides and flooding caused by climate change. Vital services such as transportation, communication, and energy will receive significant maintenance funding, with a goal to repair all corroded sewer pipes by fiscal year 2030. The plan also includes enhancing disaster preparedness by installing air conditioners in schools designated as evacuation centers, aiming to complete these arrangements as soon as possible.</p>

Bill Ackman urged both men to reconcile, while Steve Bannon suggested Trump should seize SpaceX. Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed Musk's proposal for a new political party, and European politicians also weighed in on the dispute, with the former EU tech leader posting an eyes and popcorn emoji.</p>

          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually because of lost, damaged, or missing evidence, according to data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offenses, and the number of cases recorded as an E72 are increasing, with a higher proportion of prosecutions failing to result in a conviction because of lost or missing evidence each year. A criminologist attributes the increase to resourcing issues caused by cuts to police forces, and former officers describe the amount of evidence as "overwhelming." The Law Commission is set to review proposals to re-establish a national forensic service and criminalize the mishandling of evidence.</p>

          <p>Kari Lake, a senior adviser to President Trump, plans to drastically reduce the staff at Voice of America (VOA), potentially impacting the network's ability to provide comprehensive news to a global audience. Lake intends to maintain a minimal staff to comply with statutory requirements, leading to layoffs of hundreds of employees and contractors. Former VOA leaders express concern that the cuts will severely impair the network's effectiveness as a source of soft power for the U.S. The move is being challenged in federal court, with a lawsuit filed by VOA employees and press-rights advocates alleging it undermines the agency's mission to provide news in repressive media environments.</p>

          <p>Matthew O'Brien, an immigration judge fired under the Biden administration, has been rehired and promoted by the Trump administration. O'Brien has a history of hardline stances on immigration and a high rate of asylum denial, raising concerns about the neutrality of immigration judges. The DOJ's inspector general had concluded there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a full investigation into whether Biden's Justice Department had engaged in systemic favoring or disfavoring of immigration judge candidates. Critics view this as part of a broader effort to reshape immigration courts and expedite deportations, while the DOJ defends O'Brien's qualifications and emphasizes impartiality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Copyright Office is experiencing unprecedented turmoil, with the abrupt firing of its ex-head, Shira Perlmutter, who is suing President Trump. The office released a report on AI usage and copyright, concluding that using copyrighted material to train AI models could sometimes count as fair use. Perlmutter's lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to fire people in the legislative branch, and the Copyright Office paused issuing new registration certificates. Experts say the report avoids generalizations and considers arguments on a case-by-case basis, and it remains to be seen how the report will be used in the dozens of legal cases over copyright and AI usage.</p>

The project includes the Chenab Rail Bridge, touted as the world’s highest railway arch bridge, and is part of Modi’s push for infrastructure development in the region. The railway is expected to improve connectivity, boost tourism, and cut travel time between Katra and Srinagar.

          <p>Fabio Wardley, a British heavyweight boxer, is preparing for a fight against Justis Huni while also anticipating the birth of his first child, and his partner is due to give birth just a week after the fight. Wardley candidly speaks about the uncertainty of impending parenthood, contrasting it with his control over his boxing career. At 19, Wardley was working in recruitment, having never laced up a pair of gloves, and a decade later, a victory over Huni will move him one step closer to a world-title shot, possibly as early 2026. Should Wardley approach fatherhood with the same mindset that he has driven his boxing career - dedication, a hunger to learn and a fierce determination to embrace the journey - he should be fine.</p>

The Home Builders Federation said it backed fitting more panels but cautioned against introducing "burdensome" paperwork which it said could harm government efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The government says it will be published in autumn but there will be a transitional period for developers to adjust to the regulation changes.</p>

          <p>The French Open semi-finals are set, with Novak Djokovic facing Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz playing Lorenzo Musetti.

Alcaraz, the defending champion, will look to continue his dominance over Musetti in the second semi-final.
