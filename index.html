          <p>A health think tank reports that urgent and emergency care in England is performing significantly worse than before the pandemic.  Record-high A&E waiting times and delays in discharging patients are cited as major issues.  The report argues that blaming external factors like flu outbreaks overlooks underlying systemic problems within the NHS.  The findings call for addressing the root causes of the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Schools Bill aims to reduce school uniform costs by limiting the number of branded items schools can require.  The bill proposes a limit of three branded items, excluding ties, aiming to save families an estimated £50 per year.  The legislation is currently under review by the House of Lords.
