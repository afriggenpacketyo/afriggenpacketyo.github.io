          <p>Influential conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot at Utah Valley University while speaking at an event, prompting a massive manhunt for the shooter. Eyewitnesses reported Kirk recoiling after a single shot rang out, with blood visible on his neck, before the crowd scattered in terror. Law enforcement officials are reviewing CCTV footage and believe the suspect fired from the roof of a nearby building. Kirk, known for co-founding Turning Point USA, was a prominent figure in conservative circles and a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump. The shooting has sparked shock and grief across the political spectrum, with Trump ordering flags to be flown at half-mast in Kirk's honor. The article reflects on the event's impact on political discourse. </p>

          <p>Consumer prices in August rose at an annual rate of 2.9%, slightly above expectations, while weekly jobless claims unexpectedly jumped. The consumer price index increased by 0.4% for the month, double the previous month's increase, driven primarily by rising shelter, food, and energy costs. The core reading, excluding food and energy, also showed a gain, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. These reports provide key data points for the Federal Reserve as it considers potential interest rate cuts at its upcoming policy meeting. Market pricing indicates a strong likelihood of a rate cut, although the extent of the cut remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City is observing the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks with the annual reading of names and moments of silence at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. The attacks, which occurred on September 11, 2001, involved terrorists hijacking four planes and crashing them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. The article details a timeline of the events, from the takeoffs of the flights to the collapse of the Twin Towers, emphasizing the profound impact on the city and the nation. The attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,977 people from 90 countries, marking the highest death toll on U.S. soil since Pearl Harbor. The memorial serves as a reminder to "never forget" the tragic events of that day.</p>

          <p>The Global Sumud Flotilla, an activist group attempting to deliver aid to Gaza, reported a second drone attack on its vessels while docked in Tunisia. The boat, sailing under the British flag, sustained fire damage on its top deck, prompting an investigation by Tunisian authorities, who consider the attack a deliberate act. This incident follows a previous drone strike on another flotilla vessel, leading the group to accuse Israel of attempting to derail their mission. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is among those participating in the flotilla, which aims to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. Israel maintains the blockade to prevent weapons and materials from entering the territory, which is controlled by Hamas.</p>

This report arrives before the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut, potentially giving policymakers pause as they weigh the impact of reduced borrowing costs on prices. The article notes that tariffs have modestly contributed to overall inflation, with price increases largely attributed to housing and food products. This report was released following Trump's dismissal of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, was fired after emails surfaced revealing closer ties to Jeffrey Epstein than previously known. The emails, released by The Sun, showed Mandelson expressing sympathy and support for Epstein in 2008 during his first conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Mandelson had told Epstein to "fight for early release" and said "I think the world of you." The Foreign Office stated that the emails showed a depth and extent of relationship materially different from what was known at the time of his appointment. This decision follows the release of a 2003 birthday album where Mandelson referred to Epstein as "my best pal."</p>

          <p>Kashmiri artisans are facing economic hardship due to new tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on Indian goods. These tariffs, which can reach up to 50%, are making Kashmiri handicrafts more expensive for U.S. buyers, potentially leading to a decline in demand and impacting the livelihoods of thousands of artisans. The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry has described the tariffs as "catastrophic" for the handicraft sector, with concerns that U.S. customers may turn to countries like Italy where tariffs are lower. This situation is compounded by a decline in tourism following an attack in Pahalgam, further straining the region's economy.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's economic policies argues that they are less about a coherent economic strategy and more about his desire to control everything around him. The author identifies three main components of Trump's formula: declaring emergencies to justify intervention, making threats to force private actors to do his bidding, and demanding tribute. Examples include tariffs imposed under emergency declarations, threats against companies for negative coverage, and demands for financial tribute. The article suggests that Trumponomics is about Trump's personal power rather than a specific economic ideology.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers arrested in a U.S. immigration raid at an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia are being sent home on a chartered flight. The detention of the workers, who were allegedly working illegally, sparked outrage in South Korea and threatened to impact future investments in the U.S. Following discussions with U.S. officials, the workers will be transported without restraints and will face no problems reentering the U.S. to work in the future. The incident highlights the need for a visa quota for skilled South Korean workers to support high-tech manufacturing in the U.S.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the decline of teen babysitting and the consequences of this shift. Once a rite of passage for teens, babysitting has become more professionalized, with experienced adults filling the role. This change has led to a loss of formative experiences for teens and a missed opportunity for younger children to interact with older role models. The rise of surveillance culture and intensive parenting has contributed to higher expectations for babysitters, making it harder for teens to gain experience and build community ties.</p>

          <p>The U.K. has fired its ambassador to the U.S., Peter Mandelson, following the release of documents detailing his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The documents revealed a close friendship, including a letter in which Mandelson called Epstein his "best pal." The British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office stated that the emails showed a depth and extent of relationship materially different from what was known at the time of his appointment. The statement added that Mandelson's suggestion that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful was new information.</p>

          <p>An article argues that colleges and universities must take drastic measures to limit unauthorized AI use on campus to preserve the educational experience. The author suggests a "ruthless de-teching" of classrooms and the entire institution, including banning Wi-Fi, smartphones, and laptops. Instead, students could use digital typewriters and designated computer labs for work requiring internet access. The author contends that these measures are necessary to make cheating prohibitively high and to benefit campus intellectual culture and social life.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that husbands can take the surname of their wives, overturning a law that previously barred them from doing so. The court found that the law constituted gender-based discrimination, violating equality rights enshrined in the constitution. The case was brought by two couples who were denied the right to either take their wives' surnames or hyphenate their surnames to include their wives' surnames. Parliament will now have to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the ruling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study links hundreds of severe heat waves to human-caused climate change and the greenhouse gas pollution of major fossil fuel producers. The study, published in Nature, found that 213 heat waves were substantially more likely and intense because of the activity of major fossil fuel producers, including oil, coal, and cement companies, as well as some countries. Scientists found that as much as a quarter of the heat waves would be "virtually impossible" without the climate pollution from major fossil fuel producers. The research adds to a growing body of evidence linking the emissions of fossil fuel companies to extreme weather events.</p>
