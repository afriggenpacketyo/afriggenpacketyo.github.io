        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A crucial procedural vote in the House of Representatives on President Trump's major domestic policy bill was held open for hours into the night due to a lack of support from Republican members. Despite intense pressure from both House leadership and the president himself, a small group of holdouts from both the moderate and conservative wings of the party prevented the bill from advancing. The legislation, which passed the Senate by a narrow margin, includes extensive tax cuts and increased spending on border security, but its changes to Medicaid and its overall cost have caused significant division within the GOP. The stalemate puts the president's self-imposed July 4th deadline for the bill's passage in serious jeopardy.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from China has developed a new form of blockchain technology specifically designed to withstand attacks from future quantum computers. Standard blockchain systems, which underpin cryptocurrencies and other secure digital ledgers, rely on encryption methods that could be vulnerable to the immense processing power of quantum computing. The new solution, created by a team from the Beijing Institute of Technology and Guilin University of Electronic Technology, aims to solve this emerging security problem. This development addresses growing concerns that even the most advanced current security protocols could be compromised by next-generation computing threats, ensuring the long-term viability of blockchain applications.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two others injured. The blasts at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility triggered a large fire that spread to nearby grasslands and prompted mandatory evacuations for a one-mile radius. Family members of workers have gathered nearby, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones. Officials stated that smaller explosions were still occurring at the site hours later, complicating efforts for first responders. The company, which has an active license for pyrotechnic imports and public displays, has expressed its condolences while an investigation into the cause of the incident is initiated.</p>

          <p>A large forest fire on the Greek island of Crete has forced the evacuation of at least 1,500 residents and tourists from four settlements, including the popular resort of Achlia. The blaze, which broke out Wednesday afternoon, was fanned by strong winds, making it extremely difficult for firefighters to contain. While water-dropping aircraft were grounded overnight, over 150 firefighters battled the flames on the ground. There have been no reports of serious injuries, though some individuals received treatment for breathing difficulties. The incident highlights the persistent threat of wildfires in Greece during its hot, dry summers, which has been exacerbated by a recent heat wave across Europe.</p>

          <p>An ambitious tax and spending package championed by President Donald Trump has stalled in the House of Representatives due to dissent from a handful of Republican lawmakers.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would add an estimated $3.3 trillion to the national debt and result in 12 million people losing health insurance coverage over a decade.

Over 120 Labour MPs had threatened to vote against the planned changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), forcing the government to delay the new eligibility rules.

          <p>Senior United Nations officials have issued a stark warning that gangs now have "near-total control" of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and are expanding their violent activities into previously peaceful regions. An estimated 90% of the capital is controlled by criminal groups, who are filling the vacuum left by the state and establishing parallel governance structures. The U.N. warned that without greater international action, the "total collapse of state presence in the capital could become a very real scenario." The crisis has deepened since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, with a U.N.-backed Kenyan police mission remaining understaffed and underfunded to combat the escalating violence.</p>

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's historic 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that he has cemented his status as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had an unparalleled five-year peak, Kershaw's greatness is defined by his remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons. The piece highlights that Kershaw has surpassed Koufax in nearly every significant career pitching statistic, including wins and strikeouts. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the author emphasizes that his sustained excellence and leadership have been the cornerstone of the Dodgers' modern era of success.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has reversed its export restrictions on certain chip-design software to China, according to announcements from semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The companies are now working to restore access to their products for affected customers in China. This move rolls back a policy from May that required U.S. firms to obtain licenses before exporting critical semiconductor-related software and technology. The reversal is seen as a significant step in de-escalating trade tensions, coming after China signaled progress on a trade truce with the U.S. The news prompted a significant rise in the share prices of both Synopsys and Cadence.

          <p>President Trump's major tax-and-spending bill is facing a significant setback in the House, as Republican leaders have been unable to secure enough votes from their own party to advance the legislation. A key procedural vote to set the rules for debate was stalled after five Republicans voted against it, a number sufficient to block the bill's progress. The opposition comes from both conservative hardliners and moderate Republicans, who have raised concerns over the bill's cuts to Medicaid and its impact on the national debt. This failure to unite the party presents a major challenge for House Speaker Mike Johnson and jeopardizes the president's goal of signing the bill into law by July 4th. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the dynamic and evolving nature of the Spanish language, spoken by nearly 600 million people worldwide. The author contrasts the Spanish-speaking world's general acceptance of regional variations with the more rigid attitudes sometimes seen among English speakers regarding Americanisms. The article celebrates how different dialects, particularly from Latin America, enrich the language with new words and nuances, making it more expressive. While acknowledging that linguistic snobbery exists, the author argues that the collective, cross-continental use of Spanish is what keeps it alive and thriving, viewing its many variations not as obstacles but as a testament to its resilience and beauty.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New York acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges against him, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, charges that each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The verdict came after a high-profile, seven-week trial that included graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse and coercion. Combs, who had been detained since his arrest, will remain in custody pending his sentencing, which is proposed for October 3. The mixed verdict concludes a landmark trial that has severely damaged his reputation.</p>

          <p>With the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives being exceptionally narrow, the possibility of a tie vote on legislation has become more relevant. This article explains the simple but crucial rule governing such a scenario: if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure automatically fails. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This rule was recently highlighted during a failed vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The current political dynamics mean that even a few defections can lead to a legislative stalemate, making every vote critical for the majority party.</p>

Conversely, for women who have had a hysterectomy and can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce the risk of breast cancer.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a 30-year-old former criminology PhD student, has pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students in a deal with prosecutors to avoid the death penalty. Kohberger admitted to one count of burglary and four counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogen in their off-campus home. As part of the agreement, he waived his right to appeal and is expected to be sentenced to life in prison. The plea deal has divided the victims' families, with some expressing support for the closure it brings, while others felt let down by the state.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, prosecutors revealed key evidence that linked him to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The evidence included DNA from a knife sheath left at the scene, which was matched to Kohberger through a Q-tip secretly retrieved from his family's trash. Investigators also used cell phone data that placed him near the victims' home multiple times before the attack and surveillance footage tracking his car. The summary detailed how Kohberger meticulously cleaned his car and apartment after the crime. While the evidence explains how he was caught, the plea deal means his motive for the brutal, seemingly random attack remains unknown.</p>
