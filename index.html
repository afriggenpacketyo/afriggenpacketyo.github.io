          <p>The annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, projected to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, may face a delayed announcement if a federal government shutdown occurs. The adjustment is based on third-quarter inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which could be postponed, thereby impacting the millions of beneficiaries awaiting news of their benefit increase. A similar shutdown in 2013 also pushed back the COLA announcement, creating uncertainty for seniors who rely on the adjustment to cope with rising costs for necessities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former library director in Campbell County, Wyoming, who was fired in 2023 amid a contentious dispute over books with LGBTQ+ themes, has won a $700,000 settlement. Terri Lesley sued the county after her termination, alleging her First Amendment rights were violated and that she was subjected to a hostile work environment for refusing to remove the challenged books. The settlement resolves her lawsuit against county officials, though a separate suit against individuals who contested the books will continue. Lesley stated that she feels vindicated for standing up for constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>China has formalized and tightened its export controls on rare earths, materials crucial for manufacturing high-tech products like smartphones and solar panels. The new regulations require foreign companies to obtain government approval for exporting products containing these materials and to disclose their intended use, a move Beijing states is to safeguard national security. This action significantly impacts global supply chains, particularly in the U.S. defense and chip industries, as China processes approximately 90% of the world's rare earths and now also restricts the export of related processing technology.</p>

          <p>Shares of luxury automaker Ferrari plummeted by over 16% following an update that disappointed investors and fell short of analyst expectations. The company adjusted its full-year financial guidance and, more significantly, scaled back its ambitions for vehicle electrification, now targeting only 20% of its 2030 model lineup to be fully electric, down from a previous goal of 40%. This strategic pivot reflects a broader trend among carmakers facing challenges with EV adoption, though it has created near-term uncertainty about the company's growth trajectory.

          <p>A recent Gallup poll has identified a significant cultural trend: a sharp decline in reported alcohol consumption among Republicans, whose rate of drinking has dropped 19 points in just two years. This article explores the potential drivers behind this shift toward sobriety on the American right, including the influence of prominent teetotalers like Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson. Other factors considered are the rise of a health and wellness focus within conservative circles and a potential resurgence of traditional temperance values associated with Christian nationalism.</p>

These oversights have been criticized as a departure from standard investigative practices for a suspicious death, fueling continued questions and speculation surrounding the official ruling of suicide.

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Increasing Use of the Military in Domestic Affairs Raises Alarms</h2>

          <p>This opinion column argues that President Trump's actions are dangerously eroding the long-standing American principle of separating the military from domestic partisan politics. The author points to the deployment of troops in U.S. cities, the purging of top military officials, and the use of military venues for rally-like speeches as alarming developments. The piece suggests that these moves to turn the armed forces into a loyalist militia would have appalled the nation's founders, and it criticizes Congress for its failure to act as a check on this executive overreach.</p>

          <p>The legal case against Bella Culley, a 19-year-old British woman accused of smuggling drugs into the country of Georgia, has been postponed to allow for the finalization of a plea bargain. Culley, who is pregnant, could have faced a life sentence if convicted on charges of possessing and trafficking 12kg of marijuana and 2kg of hashish. Her defense lawyer stated an intent to appeal for a presidential pardon after the plea deal is finalized, which is understood to involve a significant financial sum raised by her family.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Elon Musk Could Earn Billions from Tesla Pay Package with Minimal Goal Achievement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis of Elon Musk's historic pay package proposal from Tesla reveals that he could potentially earn tens of billions of dollars without meeting the most ambitious goals. The Reuters review found that several performance targets related to vehicle sales and product development are vaguely defined or relatively easy to achieve. This structure could enable massive stock payouts based on modest stock growth and hitting a few lower-tier targets, even if Musk fails to deliver on revolutionary promises like fully autonomous cars or hitting difficult profit milestones.

          <p>In a personal essay, a contributor diagnosed with ALS shares their journey and expresses a feeling of hope for a cure, inspired by the legacy of Lou Gehrig. However, this optimism is tempered by frustration with the Trump administration's cuts to U.S. medical research funding, which affects not only ALS but also Alzheimer's and heart disease. The author argues that taking political action, such as supporting California's Proposition 50 to shift congressional control, is a crucial way to fight back and advocate for the restoration of vital scientific programs.</p>

          <p>An LAPD sergeant has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, claiming she faced a campaign of retaliation after she reported misconduct by a former assistant chief. Sgt. Jessica Bell alleges that after finding an Apple AirTag planted by then-Assistant Chief Al Labrada and testifying in his disciplinary hearing, she was denied a promised position and became the target of multiple internal affairs complaints filed by him. Her lawsuit is one of many that highlight a persistent problem of whistleblower retaliation within the department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a leaked list, the Trump administration is considering canceling an additional 300 clean energy projects, valued at over $15.8 billion. This potential move follows the recent termination of nearly $8 billion in projects located exclusively in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The new list of potential cuts appears more bipartisan, affecting states like Texas and Ohio, but California would still face the largest total loss of funding, exceeding $3.5 billion across both rounds of cancellations, severely impacting its clean hydrogen and EV initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is considering declaring a state of emergency in response to an escalation of federal immigration raids under the Trump administration. This declaration would grant the board additional powers to protect residents, including the ability to enact an eviction moratorium for households that have lost income due to a family member's detainment or deportation. While the motion has majority support, some officials have raised concerns about potential legal challenges from the federal government and the financial burden that a moratorium would place on landlords.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mormon Women for Ethical Government (MWEG), a nonpartisan organization, was a leading plaintiff in a successful lawsuit that has forced the Utah Legislature to redraw the state's congressional districts. The suit argued that the map drawn by lawmakers constituted an illegal partisan gerrymander that nullified a voter-approved initiative for an independent redistricting commission. The court's ruling in favor of the plaintiffs has inserted Utah into the national political battle over redistricting and control of the U.S. House, demonstrating the impact of faith-based citizen activism.</p>
