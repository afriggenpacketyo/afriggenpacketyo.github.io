          <p>Hamas has announced its intention to release Edan Alexander, an American citizen held hostage in Gaza, as a goodwill gesture before President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The release is intended to facilitate ceasefire negotiations and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade. Alexander, a dual Israeli-American citizen, was abducted during the October 7, 2023, attacks. The United States has been in direct talks with Hamas leaders in Qatar to secure Alexander's release and end the ongoing conflict.</p>

This innovative approach, developed by Swiss neuroscientists, bypasses the spinal cord injury and allows for direct communication between the brain and the muscles controlling leg movement.

          <p>Linda Miller, a fraud expert, estimates that the U.S. government loses nearly $1 trillion annually to fraud, much of which is perpetrated by sophisticated transnational crime rings using stolen identities. The problem escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic, as relief programs moved online with minimal safeguards. These rings, often linked to foreign adversarial nation states like China and Russia, impersonate Americans to access government funds. The FBI is actively investigating these digital gangs, which operate with the knowledge that their governments won't interrupt their activity.</p>

The move is intended to lower drug prices for employers but restricts treatment options for patients. Doctors generally prefer Zepbound for most patients, and some patients are expressing concern about losing access to the more effective drug.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to accept Russia's proposal for direct talks, contradicting the European leaders' plan for a ceasefire first. After European leaders set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a ceasefire or face more sanctions, Putin offered direct talks in Turkey. Zelenskyy responded cautiously, then added he would personally attend negotiations. Trump backed the Russian offer, stating it would allow for determining if a deal is possible.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece cautions against viewing the artificial intelligence (AI) race solely through the lens of competition between the United States and China. The author argues that such a binary narrative neglects the agency and interests of other countries, multinational organizations, and corporations.

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced plans to tighten visa rules in an effort to fix a 'broken' immigration system. Proposed changes include stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents, as well as a longer wait time of 10 years before applying for settled status. A 'fast-track' settlement process will be established for high-skilled workers like nurses and engineers. Critics have warned that the new rules may split families and create integration challenges.</p>

Sharvit believes all of the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, while the activist believes Israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders. The encounter highlights the starkly different visions of Israel's future.</p>
