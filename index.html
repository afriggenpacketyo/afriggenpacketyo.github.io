          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling against using government funds for a Catholic charter school. The proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. The deadlock sets no national precedent, leaving the question of state-sponsored religious charter schools unresolved, though it is likely to be revisited by the court in the future. The decision highlights the ongoing debate about the separation of church and state in education, with proponents vowing to continue the fight.</p>

The victims' family spoke about the devastating consequences of domestic violence, while a friend of Smith's said he seemed at peace with death. Tennessee had paused executions for five years due to COVID-19 and procedural issues, but recently resumed them with new guidelines.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing the university's failure to comply with requests for records related to visa-holding students involved in campus protests. Secretary Noem accused Harvard of perpetuating an unsafe environment hostile to Jewish students and promoting pro-Hamas rhetoric. Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked effective immediately, requiring existing foreign students to transfer or lose their legal status. The move follows previous actions against Harvard, including frozen federal funding and investigations into antisemitism and DEI policies.</p>
