          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog clarified that Israel's recent actions against Iran are aimed at dismantling its nuclear capabilities rather than instigating regime change. Speaking to CNBC, Herzog accused Iran of violating international agreements and accelerating its pursuit of nuclear weapons. He emphasized the necessity of taking decisive action to address imminent threats, asserting that the strikes on Iran have significantly impacted its nuclear program. Herzog also mentioned ongoing back-channel discussions with world leaders to de-escalate the situation.

          <p>Iran and Israel have continued exchanging air attacks, raising concerns about a broader conflict and potential U.S. involvement. Israeli strikes have reportedly targeted Iran's military command and nuclear capabilities, resulting in casualties on both sides. President Trump has been ambiguous about whether the U.S. will join Israel's air campaign, stating that he may or may not intervene. Iranian officials have expressed a willingness to meet with U.S. representatives, but Trump indicated that such talks might be too late. Meanwhile, some Tehran residents have sought refuge outside the city due to the intensified airstrikes. The foreign ministers of Germany, France, and Britain are planning to hold nuclear talks with their Iranian counterpart in Geneva.</p>

          <p>Fuji Megane Co., a Japanese glasses manufacturer, will donate 5,100 pairs of spectacles to people displaced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company has a long history of supporting refugees and will distribute the glasses through the UNHCR. The donation includes glasses for children and will be provided after on-site eye examinations. The company's president, Akio Kanai, was himself a refugee during World War II, which inspired his dedication to helping others in need. The company has donated a total of 180,000 pairs of glasses to refugees worldwide since 1983.</p>

          <p>The majority ownership of the Lakers is being sold to Dodgers chairman Mark Walter and his TWG Global group, valuing the franchise at $10 billion, the richest transaction in sports history. This move is seen as a positive change for the Lakers, who have lacked a sustained championship vision since the death of Jerry Buss in 2013. Walter's success with the Dodgers, including multiple playoff appearances and World Series wins, suggests a promising future for the Lakers. The new ownership is expected to invest heavily in the team's infrastructure, coaching staff, and player acquisitions, with a focus on both present and future success.</p>

          <p>Leading climate scientists warn that the Earth could breach the symbolic 1.5C warming limit in as little as three years at current levels of carbon dioxide emissions. The study highlights that record emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases have shrunk the "carbon budget" to just 130 billion tonnes. If global CO2 emissions remain at their current highs, the world has roughly three years until that budget is exhausted. The researchers emphasize that rapid and stringent emissions cuts are more important than ever to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. They also caution against relying on carbon removal technologies as a sole solution.</p>
