        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dozens of Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a contentious new congressional map. The proposed redistricting plan, supported by former President Trump, aims to create several new GOP-leaning districts, potentially solidifying the party's majority in the U.S. House. The lawmakers, who traveled to Chicago, could face daily fines and threats of arrest for breaking quorum, a tactic previously used in Texas politics to block legislation. This move escalates a fierce political battle over voting rights and representation, drawing national attention and support from the Democratic National Committee.</p>

          <p>Economist Jeffrey Sachs expressed concern that the United States' confrontational stance on trade with China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to war. In an interview, Sachs argued that while a full-scale trade war is unlikely due to mutual economic interests, ongoing friction and unpredictability from the U.S. will persist. He advised that China should focus on expanding trade with developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. and European markets. Sachs characterized the trade conflict as being initiated by the U.S., urging for American prudence to de-escalate tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Chile, rescue teams have recovered the body of the final missing miner, bringing the death toll from a tunnel collapse at the El Teniente copper mine to five. The incident, which was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor, trapped the workers deep underground at the world's largest subterranean copper mine. Another worker was killed at the time of the initial collapse, raising the total number of fatalities to six. State-owned mining company Codelco has expressed condolences as authorities launch a criminal investigation into the tragedy, examining whether the cause was natural seismic activity or related to mining operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, just days after a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region. The eruption sent a plume of ash and gas nearly 27,000 feet into the air, prompting an aviation alert. While the area is sparsely populated and no immediate threat to communities has been reported, the timing has led to scientific speculation. Seismologists suggest that while the quake likely did not cause the eruption directly, its seismic waves could have triggered a volcanic system that was already close to erupting.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot minke whale was killed after being struck by a boat near the Jersey Shore, an incident that also threw a passenger from the vessel into the water. The person who went overboard was reportedly unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center responded to calls about the whale, which was later found deceased in shallow water. A necropsy is planned to determine the exact cause of death, while officials have urged boaters to maintain a safe distance from the carcass. The event highlights the potential dangers to both marine life and humans when vessels and whales interact in coastal waters.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson narrowly missed qualifying for the 200m final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships, ending her bid to compete in the event at the upcoming World Championships. She finished her heat just one-hundredth of a second behind the final qualifier. This athletic setback concludes a difficult week for Richardson, who was arrested days earlier in connection with a domestic violence allegation involving her boyfriend. As the defending 100m world champion, she automatically has a spot to compete in that event, but her hopes of doubling in the 200m are now over.</p>

The U.S. State Department confirmed the death, condemned the violence, and is providing consular assistance to the family.

          <p>The recent sale of the iconic American company U.S. Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel includes an unusual provision granting former President Donald Trump significant influence over the company's future. The deal structure reportedly gives Trump a 'golden share,' a mechanism that can provide veto power or special voting rights over key corporate decisions. This arrangement suggests that despite the foreign acquisition, there remains a powerful lever of American political influence embedded within the company's new ownership. The specifics of this 'golden share' and how it might be exercised are central to the future of the historic steel manufacturer.</p>

The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and lawmakers, who warn it undermines the credibility of vital government data and sets a dangerous precedent.

          <h2>UK Government Announces Harsher Penalties for People Smugglers Using Social Media</h2>

          <p>The British government plans to introduce new legislation that could see people smugglers who advertise their services on social media facing up to five years in prison. This move aims to give law enforcement more tools to combat gangs that facilitate illegal crossings of the English Channel, a journey made by a record 25,000 people this year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the criminals for selling a "false promise" and leading migrants into life-threatening situations. The plan is part of the Labour government's broader strategy to address the ongoing migrant crisis and speed up the asylum process.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a new $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. The fund was established as part of recent legislation that also made significant cuts to Medicaid, raising concerns about the financial viability of rural healthcare providers. Dr. Oz stated the funds are intended to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the expansion of technology like telehealth. The new law also introduces stricter Medicaid work requirements and eligibility checks, which are projected to reduce coverage for millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers ended a scoring drought to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic baserunning and timely hitting rather than power. After struggling offensively, the team manufactured runs through an aggressive send from the third base coach, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5.2 scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a winning record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team as it continues to grapple with a slumping lineup and experiments with its batting order.</p>

          <p>A growing number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for elected office, motivated by a desire to counteract what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, many without prior political experience, are leveraging their backgrounds as prosecutors to campaign on platforms of restoring the rule of law and protecting democratic institutions. Resigning from what they once considered dream jobs, they are now engaging in public advocacy, criticizing the dismantling of DOJ norms and running for offices ranging from local city attorney to U.S. Congress.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively high commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA will consult on a scheme expected to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, covering agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator has advised consumers to contact their loan providers directly rather than using claims management companies to receive their full compensation. (not investment advice)</p>
