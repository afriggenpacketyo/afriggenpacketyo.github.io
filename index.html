          <h2>Snap Shares Plunge Following Disappointing Quarter and Lack of Guidance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 17:45:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Snap's stock experienced a significant drop due to weaker-than-expected first-quarter results and the company's decision not to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties and potential impacts on advertising demand. While revenue increased by 14% year-over-year, Snap is facing challenges such as advertisers reporting impacts from changes to de minimis exemption. Snap lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses range, and reported an increase in daily active users and Snapchat+ subscribers. The company attributed the 8 cents loss to a $70.1 million charge related to cash severance, stock-based compensation expenses and other costs associated with a 2024 restructuring.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring ways to encourage Americans to marry and have more children, including a lump-sum “baby bonus” of $5,000 for mothers after giving birth. While similar policies exist in other countries, the proposal has sparked debate in the US, with critics viewing it as a distraction from broader issues like affordable childcare and healthcare. The article notes that baby bonuses may provide short-term financial relief but are unlikely to significantly boost fertility rates and could be seen as promoting traditional gender roles. The article describes the baby bonus in relation to other pronatal proposals, such as the Heritage Foundation calling to reduce federal subsidies to higher education.</p>

          <p>The Mellon Foundation is providing $15 million in emergency funding to state humanities councils after the National Endowment for the Humanities canceled most existing grants due to President Trump's priorities. The funding will help preserve humanities programs, particularly in rural states, by providing operational support and challenge grants. The National Endowment for the Humanities redirected its funding toward projects like the National Garden of American Heroes and the "Celebrate America!" grant program, leading to staff layoffs and an existential threat to humanities councils.

          <p>Oddity Tech, the beauty and tech retailer behind Il Makiage and Spoiled Child, is raising its earnings and profit guidance for fiscal 2025 despite potential tariff headwinds. The company expects tariff impacts to be manageable and offset by cost efficiencies, and is not planning price increases. Shares soared 15% in extended trading after the announcement. The company's direct-to-consumer model and limited exposure to China are helping it weather the tariff threat.</p>

          <p>New York State has agreed to fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (MTA) five-year capital plan with $68.4 billion to prevent the collapse of the subway, bus system, and commuter railroads. However, the completion of the projects is not assured due to threats from the Trump administration to withhold funding unless the state ends its congestion pricing program in Manhattan. The plan includes buying new trains and buses, modernizing the subway signal system, and making stations more accessible. The MTA must now prove it can deliver the ambitious plan on time and on budget.</p>

          <p>Bret Stephens discusses how Trump's tariffs are affecting a friend's toy business, USAopoly, which relies on manufacturing in China. The friend, Dane Chapin, voted for Trump but is now concerned that the tariffs are putting his business and 80 employees at risk. Chapin notes that China has a highly developed supply chain that allows America to enjoy affordable toys and games, and moving production domestically would significantly raise prices. The article suggests that Trump's trade policy is hurting smaller American businesses and that Democrats should seize the opportunity to win over disaffected Trump voters.</p>

The election saw a significant turnaround, seemingly powered by the annexation threats and tariff tactics of President Trump. The increased support for the Liberals came at the expense of smaller parties. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre lost his own seat, while NDP leader Singh also lost his own seat in the House of Commons.</p>
