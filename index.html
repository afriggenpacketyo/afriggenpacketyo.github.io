          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck central Texas, resulting in at least 48 fatalities and a large-scale emergency response. A significant number of those missing are children from Camp Mystic, a summer camp located along the hard-hit Guadalupe River. Officials report that hundreds of people have been rescued, some from treetops, as the river rose with unprecedented speed. The governor has signed a federal disaster declaration to provide state resources for the ongoing search and rescue operations, which continue amid the widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has introduced new regulations aimed at standardizing the policy coordination and review processes for its top leadership bodies. According to state media, these organs are to focus on major strategic planning and oversight. Some analysts interpret this development as a potential signal that President Xi Jinping is beginning to delegate more power to his deputies. The move could also be viewed as a step towards formalizing a plan for his eventual succession, though its true intent remains a subject of observation.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time and charged with the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in 2020. This new development comes after her remains, found in 2023, revealed the presence of a unique combination of tranquilizer drugs used for sedating wildlife. The indictment states that Morphew was the only private citizen in the area with access to these specific drugs, which he admitted to using on deer. He was previously charged in 2021, but the case was dismissed before trial, and he has consistently maintained his innocence.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's foreign policy, suggesting he employs what political scientists call the "Madman Theory" to gain leverage over both allies and adversaries. By cultivating an unpredictable and highly centralized decision-making process, he aims to coerce concessions, as seen in recent dealings with NATO allies and Iran. This approach has successfully prompted European nations to increase defense spending but raises questions about the long-term reliability of U.S. commitments.

A spectacular acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé helped secure the win, setting up a highly anticipated semi-final clash against his former club, Paris Saint-Germain. The match highlighted both the skill of Madrid's stars and the promise of its emerging young talent.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning that recent cuts to scientific research funding by the Trump administration are jeopardizing the goal of eliminating HIV in the United States. A former CDC official explained that while funding for treatment may be preserved, cuts to research for prevention, a vaccine, and a cure are particularly concerning. These reductions threaten to reverse a decade of progress that has seen a significant decline in new infections and deaths. Experts fear that without robust prevention efforts, the country could see a resurgence in new HIV cases.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially announced his resignation from Congress, further shrinking the GOP's already narrow majority in the House. His departure leaves Republicans with a 219-212 majority, creating additional challenges for House Speaker Mike Johnson's ability to pass legislation. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public service to start a business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party. His solidly Republican district will hold a special election to fill the vacancy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to curb the use of Chinese-made drones through an executive order, but faces significant hurdles due to China's commanding position in the global market. Industry insiders and analysts note that Chinese firms, such as DJI, are deeply integrated into commercial supply chains. A potential ban on these products is seen as difficult to implement and could lead to substantially higher costs for consumers and businesses seeking non-Chinese alternatives. This highlights the complexities of decoupling from China in key technology sectors.</p>

          <p>An email sent by the Social Security Administration (SSA) praising a new spending bill signed by President Trump has been sharply criticized as misleading and partisan. The email claimed the bill eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. However, critics and former SSA officials point out that the legislation only provides a temporary tax deduction, not a full elimination of taxes. This has led to accusations that the traditionally apolitical agency is spreading misinformation to promote a political agenda.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that maternal exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke can negatively impact fetal development. Researchers found that exposure during the first trimester, or even before conception, was associated with babies being smaller in the womb and at birth. The study also noted that these effects were nearly doubled for pregnant people living in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods, which are often hotter and have poorer air quality. Health experts are calling for more awareness and protective measures for this high-risk group as climate change intensifies these environmental threats.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, conducted 350 rescues on the Fourth of July as beachgoers were caught in unexpectedly dangerous surf and strong rip currents. One particularly hazardous "monster rip current" swept more than ten people far from shore, requiring a major rescue effort. The incident prompted the National Weather Service to issue warnings for dangerous swimming conditions along the Southern California coast through the holiday weekend. The high volume of rescues highlights the potential dangers of summer surf conditions.</p>
