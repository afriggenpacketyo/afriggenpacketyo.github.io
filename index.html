          <h2>France Announces Intent to Formally Recognize Palestinian Statehood in September</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 00:34:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state, with a formal announcement planned for the UN General Assembly in September. This move would make France the first G7 nation to take such a step, a decision Macron framed as part of a commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials but drew strong condemnation from Israel, which characterized it as a "reward for terror," while the U.S. labeled the decision "reckless." The decision adds to growing international pressure on Israel regarding the conflict in Gaza and the path toward a two-state solution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British newspapers are highlighting Health Secretary Wes Streeting's firm stance against striking junior doctors, whose five-day walkout he claims is based on "unreasonable" demands that threaten patient safety. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has echoed these concerns, stating the strikes play into the hands of those wishing to see the NHS fail. Simultaneously, front pages feature compelling images from Gaza, with reports on a parliamentary committee urging the UK government to increase efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. This coverage reflects a domestic focus on healthcare turmoil alongside significant international pressure regarding the Middle East conflict.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting to address escalating military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia along their shared border. The fighting, which has continued for a second day, centers on a long-running dispute over territory near several ancient temples. Both nations have accused the other of initiating the violence, which has involved rockets, artillery, and F-16 jets, resulting in casualties and the evacuation of over 100,000 Thai civilians. International actors, including the US, EU, and China, have expressed deep concern and are calling for an immediate de-escalation and dialogue.</p>

          <p>The Honolulu Police Department is alerting the public to a phone scam in which a caller, posing as an attorney, falsely claims a resident's loved one has been arrested and needs $8,000 for bail. In a recent reported incident, a resident was instructed to coordinate a cash handoff but became suspicious and confirmed with their son that no such event had occurred, thus avoiding any financial loss. Authorities are reminding citizens that bail payments are only accepted at police stations and that they should never share personal information or send money to unknown callers. This warning highlights the persistence of scams designed to exploit family emergencies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reshaping college sports, directing federal agencies to enforce new rules on athletic scholarships and compensation for athletes. The order seeks to protect non-revenue and women's sports by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels, while also reining in "pay-for-play" name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. Citing an "unprecedented threat" to collegiate athletics, the administration's move attempts to establish federal guardrails following a legal settlement that allowed for direct payments to players. The legality of the order is being questioned, but it signals significant federal intervention in the ongoing debate over amateurism in college sports.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal that has drawn sharp criticism for its timing. The approval came shortly after Paramount settled a $16 million lawsuit with President Trump and cancelled "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," whose host had been critical of the president. As part of the deal, Skydance has pledged to install an ombudsman to review bias complaints at CBS News and end diversity initiatives. Critics, including a dissenting FCC commissioner, have described the sequence of events as a "cowardly capitulation" and raised concerns about political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

The President claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately contested, explaining it incorrectly included a building completed five years ago. This public disagreement follows Mr. Trump's recent suggestions that the project's cost overruns could be grounds for firing Powell, though he later softened this stance.

          <p>A team of scientists in China has reported the first-ever direct experimental observation of quantum friction, a phenomenon occurring between solid surfaces at the quantum level. While studying folded graphene, the researchers discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy loss as heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-low-friction materials for use in highly efficient nanodevices and machines.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, the iconic professional wrestler known worldwide as Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71 after suffering a cardiac arrest at his home in Florida. Hogan was a transformative figure in entertainment, catapulting the WWE into a global phenomenon in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona. As a larger-than-life American hero, he headlined the first WrestleMania and became one of pop culture's most recognizable figures. President Trump, for whom Hogan had recently endorsed, remembered him as a "great friend" whose cultural impact was "massive."</p>

          <p>This article profiles several individuals who, after being deported from the United States, face immense challenges starting over in countries they are now unfamiliar with, such as Mexico. Many, like Juan Carlos who lived in the U.S. for 19 years, are separated from their families and struggle to find work and housing. While the Mexican government has set up some resources, support is not available everywhere deportees are sent. The piece also notes that while ICE removals are on track to be the highest since the Obama era, they fall short of the Trump administration's stated goals, with many immigrants choosing to "self-deport" amid aggressive enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Samaritans, a leading suicide prevention charity in the UK and Ireland, is planning a major restructuring that will close more than 100 of its 200-plus branches over the next decade. The charity's CEO stated that maintaining the current number of physical locations is not sustainable and hinders service delivery. The proposal has sparked significant concern among the charity's volunteers, who fear the move to fewer, larger hubs and more "virtual volunteering" will dismantle the local support networks that have been effective for 70 years. They worry it could lead to an exodus of volunteers and a more impersonal service.</p>

          <p>The UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) has issued a dire warning that one in five children in Gaza City is suffering from malnutrition, with cases rising daily. Unrwa's Commissioner-General described people in Gaza as "walking corpses" and stated that over 100 people, mostly children, have reportedly died of hunger. The report comes as more than 100 international aid organizations press for action to avert mass starvation, which they describe as a man-made crisis. Israel maintains there is no siege, but the UN insists the level of aid entering the territory is a mere "trickle."</p>

          <p>The death of Hulk Hogan marks the passing of a figure who fundamentally shaped modern popular culture, from reality television to political theatrics. This article posits that his career, which saw him pivot from an all-American "face" to a villainous "heel," created a template for brand management and direct-to-fan engagement that predated social media. Hogan's influence is seen in the mainstreaming of combative public personas and the blurring of lines between entertainment and reality. His highly public life, including scandals and a landmark lawsuit that bankrupted a media outlet, mirrored and catalyzed many of the cultural shifts seen today.</p>

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges who were recently fired by the Justice Department are speaking out, describing their dismissals as "arbitrary, unfair" and an "attack on the rule of law." The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases, received termination emails without specific cause. They claim they were pressured to rule in certain ways to facilitate deportations and that the firings create a climate of fear that undermines judicial impartiality. Their accounts add to a report from the judges' union that over 100 immigration judges have been fired or have left since the start of the Trump administration.</p>
