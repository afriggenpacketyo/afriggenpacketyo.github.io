          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr, 34, has announced his retirement from professional football due to a labral tear and degenerative changes in his right shoulder. Acquired by the Saints in 2023, Carr struggled with injuries and inconsistent performance, leading to the team drafting Tyler Shough as a potential replacement. Carr expressed gratitude to his teammates, coaches, and fans, stating he gave his all during his 11-year career, which included 4 Pro Bowl selections. With Carr's retirement, Shough and other younger quarterbacks will have an opportunity to compete for the starting position, and the Saints may consider bringing in a veteran QB through free agency.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct negotiations with Ukraine, aiming for a durable peace and eliminating the war's root causes, suggesting talks in Istanbul on May 15. This proposal follows a request from Ukraine and its Western allies for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, which Putin did not directly address. Leaders from France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland have threatened increased sanctions if Russia rejects the ceasefire. Putin mentioned he would discuss the details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while the Kremlin spokesman warned against pressuring Russia.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

A federal judge ordered her release, citing a lack of evidence for her detainment besides the op-ed.

          <p>As a conflict between India and Pakistan escalated following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration grew concerned about the potential for nuclear war. Despite Vice President JD Vance's initial reluctance to intervene, evidence of serious dogfights and explosions near Pakistan's nuclear command prompted urgent diplomatic action. Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio engaged directly with Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif, urging de-escalation. The U.S. intervention, along with efforts from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, contributed to a cease-fire agreement, though cross-border firing reportedly continued, highlighting the fragility of the situation.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials concluded the first day of sensitive talks over tariffs, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset" had been negotiated. The meetings in Switzerland, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, followed the U.S. imposing 145% tariffs on China, which retaliated with 125% levies on American imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng led the discussions, with the hope of scaling back the tariffs to relieve financial markets and companies reliant on U.S.-China trade. Chinese officials have stated they are open to negotiating but want the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

President Trump described the meeting as "very good" and constructive, signaling a potential reset in trade relations. The talks are the first since Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory levies from China. The negotiations aim to de-escalate trade hostilities and mitigate the economic impact of the tariff war, though expectations for a major breakthrough remain low.</p>

Altria's status as a Dividend King, with 59 dividend increases in the last 55 years, makes it an attractive stock in a down market, though past performance is no guarantee of future results.</p>

While recent data shows no immediate economic slowdown, surveys indicate heightened worries in the manufacturing and service sectors. Powell dismissed the idea of pre-emptive rate cuts, citing a solid economy and labor market, but some economists believe the Fed's reliance on labor market data could leave it behind the curve.</p>
