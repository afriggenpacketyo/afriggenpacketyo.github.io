          <h2>Indian Airlines Adjust Routes Due to Pakistan Airspace Closure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 01:26:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines is forcing carriers to reroute flights to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East, leading to longer and costlier journeys. Airlines like Air India and IndiGo may need to add refueling stops or cancel routes, with IndiGo potentially impacting around 50 routes and temporarily suspending flights to Almaty and Tashkent. This closure arises from escalating tensions between India and Pakistan following a deadly attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which India attributes to Pakistani militants. While passengers may not see immediate fare increases, a similar closure in 2019 cost airlines approximately $82 million, and the current situation could hinder Indian carriers' competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Mining giants and energy majors are increasingly exploring natural hydrogen, also known as white, gold, or geologic hydrogen, as a potential clean energy source. This naturally occurring hydrogen found beneath the Earth's surface produces only water when burned and contains no carbon. Companies like Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Gazprom, BP Ventures, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures are investing in exploratory efforts across several countries, particularly in Canada and the U.S. However, critics raise environmental concerns and distribution challenges, while the International Energy Agency cautions that the resource may be too scattered for economically viable capture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has revealed that baby food pouches from leading UK brands often fail to meet the nutritional needs of babies and toddlers. Laboratory testing found low levels of vitamin C and iron in many pouches, while some contained excessive amounts of sugar. Experts caution that these pouches should not replace homemade meals and can lead to health problems if used as a primary source of nutrition. The investigation also highlighted misleading marketing claims, such as pouches marketed for babies as young as four months old, against the recommendations of health organizations.</p>

          <p>Critics argue that President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs aimed at protecting the U.S. auto industry, could ultimately harm it by isolating it from global innovation. While the auto industry has historically been a cornerstone of American industrial power, U.S. automakers are now falling behind in the race for electrification, digitization, and automation. China's advancements in next-generation vehicles, supported by state subsidies, pose a significant threat to the U.S. auto industry. To remain competitive, American automakers must continue to innovate and adapt to the evolving global landscape.</p>

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policies in England will affect over four million pupils, aiming to reduce costs for families. The government intends to limit the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students, with the new rule potentially implemented by September 2026. While the government estimates parents could save around Â£50 per child, uniform retailers warn that the changes might increase costs if lower-quality generic garments need frequent replacement. The Schoolwear Association also argues that branded uniforms play a role in reducing inequality and improving behavior in schools.</p>

          <p>The US military has reported hitting over 800 Houthi targets in Yemen since launching sustained air and naval strikes on March 15, in response to Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. US Central Command said that the strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders. The Houthis, however, reported that the latest US attack on Sanaa killed at least eight people, including women and children. The US maintains it will continue to ratchet up the pressure until Houthi attacks on vessels are halted.</p>

          <p>President Trump's changes to the global trade system have challenged the perception of the United States as the source of the world's safest financial assets, creating an opportunity for Europe. Market volatility has seen investors selling off the U.S. dollar, American stocks, and U.S. Treasury bonds, although the situation eased last week. European officials view this as an opportunity to attract investors to European assets, highlighting the stability, predictability, and respect for the rule of law in Europe.</p>

          <p>Drawing on Poland's history of fighting oppressive regimes, the authors offer advice for Americans and others facing similar challenges. Key suggestions include engaging in physical activism beyond digital efforts, fostering intergenerational solidarity, defending constitutional law, resisting forced exile, and planning ahead. They emphasize the importance of documenting legal violations, building diverse movements, and developing a compelling vision for the future. The authors argue that the fight for democracy requires a long-term perspective and a commitment to engaging with those holding differing political views.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that US tariffs on Chinese imports could put as many as 16 million jobs at risk in China, particularly in the manufacturing of goods for retail and wholesale. The report identifies communication equipment, apparel, and chemical products as particularly vulnerable due to their high share in US-bound exports from China. President Trump has imposed tariffs totaling 145 per cent on Chinese imports this year, leading to an effective tariff rate of about 156 per cent. In response, Beijing has applied tariffs of 125 per cent on all US goods on top of earlier duties.</p>
