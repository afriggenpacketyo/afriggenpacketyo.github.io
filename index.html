          <h2>Gold Outperforms Traditional Safe Havens Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 01:08:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have surged in 2025, outperforming traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, driven by concerns over fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference noted that gold's appeal lies in its independence from government liabilities, unlike bonds and currencies tied to specific economies. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced a sell-off after tariff rollouts and credit rating downgrades, further fueling interest in gold as an alternative safe haven. Gold's resilience is attributed to its lack of susceptibility to high debt-to-GDP ratios and its apolitical nature, making it a favored asset amid global instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's directives to cancel NIH research grants related to LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and DEI initiatives were unlawful. Judge William Young stated that the cancellations violated federal law, constituting discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. The ruling orders the NIH to restore the terminated grants, which include studies on obstetrical outcomes for lesbian, gay, and bisexual women and the impact of discriminatory laws on LGBTQ+ teen mental health. HHS stands by its decision to end funding for research, but is exploring legal options.</p>

Japan's economy faces growth uncertainty, while inflation has remained above the BOJ's target for around three years. The BOJ expects Japan's economic growth to moderate, citing factors such as trade slowdowns and declines in domestic corporate profits, but accommodative financial conditions are expected to provide support.

The deal aims to prevent significant job losses in the West Midlands, particularly at Jaguar Land Rover's plant in Solihull. While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities regarding proof of UK-made steel. The deal also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, with officials insisting there has been no change to the UK's food safety standards.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce new sanctions targeting Russia at the G7 summit, aimed at increasing economic pressure on the Kremlin and restricting Putin's war machine. The measures, designed to squeeze Russia's energy revenues and reduce funds for the war, are being finalized with other Ukraine allies. However, the US appeared unlikely to join the move, with President Trump signaling his opposition to further measures. The UK's new sanctions package aims to keep up pressure on the Russian military industrial complex.</p>

The rise in the older homeless population puts a strain on health care systems, as they often require hospitalization and cannot be discharged due to lack of housing and support. Healthcare providers and policy experts express concern over potential cuts to government programs like Medicaid, which could further exacerbate the problem.</p>
