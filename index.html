        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has identified specific artworks and scholars at the Smithsonian Institution as objectionable for their focus on race, slavery, and sexuality, prompting a review to align the museums with the administration's cultural directives. This has drawn varied reactions from the artistic community, with some expressing fear of a chilling effect on creative expression, while others consider the criticism a "badge of honor." The situation has evoked comparisons to historical instances of art censorship, such as McCarthyism and the "degenerate art" exhibitions in Nazi Germany, raising concerns about self-censorship among artists and institutions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics and political analysts observe that President Trump's domestic and foreign policy decisions appear to be consistently guided by his personal grievances and self-interest rather than a coherent ideology. This approach was highlighted by his recent summit with Vladimir Putin, where he seemed to seek validation for his own political narratives, and his subsequent move to eliminate mail-in voting based on the Russian leader's suggestion. This conflation of personal agenda with national policy is seen as a departure from traditional presidential conduct, raising concerns about the nation's stability and international standing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular animated Netflix movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has successfully expanded its reach by hosting sold-out singalong screenings in theaters across the country, demonstrating a rare leap from a streaming platform to a cinematic event. The film, which follows an all-girl rock band fighting evil spirits, has become a cultural phenomenon, with its soundtrack dominating music charts and merchandise flying off the shelves. This move is seen as a strategic promotion for Netflix, potentially building the movie into a major franchise while catering to its enthusiastic and growing fanbase.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen the test-firing of two newly developed missile types, which state media claims are designed to counter aerial threats like drones and cruise missiles. The launches occurred while the United States and South Korea were conducting their annual "Ulchi Freedom Shield 25" joint military exercises, which Pyongyang condemned as destabilizing and reckless. These actions underscore the escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, as North Korea continues to advance its military capabilities in response to what it perceives as provocative drills by its adversaries.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that China and India are at a pivotal moment to reset their bilateral relationship, driven by recent high-level diplomatic engagements and a changing global landscape. It posits that for relations to improve, Beijing must view New Delhi as a partner and respect its strategic autonomy, rather than seeing it solely through a lens of rivalry. The piece highlights recent positive steps, such as discussions to resume direct flights and relax investment restrictions, as signs of a potential thaw in a relationship long strained by border disputes and competitive aspirations.</p>

          <p>Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, has strongly condemned recent leaks from closed security meetings, stating they seriously harm the country's security and misrepresent the IDF's operations in Gaza. His comments follow the release of recordings of former Military Intelligence chief Aharon Haliva, in which Haliva claimed Prime Minister Netanyahu ignored pre-October 7 war warnings. Katz emphasized that such disclosures weaken the military's position and provide false encouragement to Israel's enemies, reaffirming that he and the Prime Minister fully approved the IDF's operational plans.</p>

          <p>Over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in the recent Northern Strike military drills in Michigan, marking the largest-ever contingent from Taiwan in such an exercise and a significant deepening of US-Taiwan defense ties. The public disclosure of these figures by Pentagon-linked media represents a departure from the previous policy of ambiguity regarding Taiwan's involvement in American military training. This development signals a more overt and strengthened security partnership between Washington and Taipei, occurring despite the current US administration's often transactional foreign policy approach.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of sentencing rules that would empower courts to impose a wider range of restrictions on offenders serving community sentences. These measures could include bans from pubs, concerts, and sporting events, as well as travel and driving prohibitions, even if the restrictions are unrelated to the specific crime committed. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the goal is to make community punishments tougher and more restrictive, though critics and industry representatives have raised concerns about the practical implementation and funding of these new powers.</p>

The disaster, which killed 167 men, remains the world's worst offshore accident and was later attributed to systemic safety failures by the operator, Occidental Petroleum. Inspired to understand the circumstances that led to his father's death, Gorman pursued a career as a safety officer in the same industry, seeking to prevent similar catastrophes and honor his father's memory by advocating for the prioritization of human life over profit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Estonia, citizens are increasingly joining voluntary defense organizations like the Naiskodukaitse (Women's Voluntary Defense Organization) to prepare for a potential Russian invasion. This reflects a deeply rooted culture of self-defense, with civilians learning skills ranging from first aid to military tactics to support the armed forces in a crisis. Despite Russia's acts of sabotage like GPS jamming, there is a sense of preparedness rather than panic, bolstered by Estonia's significant defense spending and its crucial membership in the NATO alliance.</p>

          <h2>French Military Reserves See Surge in Volunteers Amid Growing European Security Fears</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is experiencing a significant increase in applications for its military reserves, with the number of operational reservists growing to over 46,000 as citizens seek to serve their country part-time. This surge is driven by heightened security concerns across Europe, particularly regarding an aggressive Russia, and aligns with President Emmanuel Macron's plan to double the number of reservists by 2035. The trend reflects a broader European movement to bolster military manpower, with volunteers citing a patriotic duty to protect their nation in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, has asserted that Chinese ownership of American farmland poses no threat to national security, calling such claims "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, he stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total US farmland and characterized legislative efforts to restrict such purchases as political manipulation. He argued that these restrictions are designed to undermine China-US agricultural cooperation for the political gain of a few individuals, rather than addressing a genuine security risk.</p>

          <p>In the final preseason game, the Los Angeles Chargers' backups showed a mix of promising talent and costly errors in a 30-23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Undrafted linebacker Marlowe Wax made a strong case for a roster spot with a series of outstanding defensive plays, including a strip-sack. However, the team was plagued by turnovers and penalties, and backup quarterbacks Trey Lance and DJ Uiagalelei had uneven performances, leaving coaches with difficult decisions as they prepare to cut the roster down to 53 players.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has condemned President Trump's plan to send National Guard troops to Chicago as an "abuse of power" and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." The move is part of a broader administration strategy to deploy troops to major Democrat-run cities for a crackdown on crime, a policy already implemented in Washington D.C. Chicago's mayor also expressed "grave concerns," stating that an uncoordinated deployment could inflame tensions and undermine local efforts to reduce crime, reflecting a significant conflict between federal and local authorities.</p>
