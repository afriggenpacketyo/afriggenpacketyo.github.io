          <p>Disgraced Chinese admiral and Central Military Commission (CMC) member Miao Hua is under investigation for ‚Äúlegal violations,‚Äù suggesting more serious wrongdoings than initially suspected. While his expulsion from the top legislature was reported earlier, this marks the first official acknowledgement of possible legal misconduct. Miao previously headed the CMC‚Äôs political work department, an influential position responsible for ideological control and personnel management. The investigation underscores the sensitive nature of military corruption cases in China, which are handled by a separate, more opaque justice system. Optimism surrounding the event is low, as it highlights potential instability within the Chinese military leadership.</p>

          <p>A group of friends who had been playing Dungeons & Dragons together for 30 years ended their weekly gatherings in 2020 due to political disagreements. Two of the players discussed the impact of politics on their long-standing game with StoryCorps. The players cited increasing polarization and differing views on social and political issues as the primary reasons for the game's dissolution. The article illustrates how even long-term friendships can be strained by the divisive nature of contemporary politics.

          <p>Small business owners express relief and hope as courts rule that President Trump overstepped his authority in ordering tariffs, but they remain uncertain about receiving refunds. The White House vows to appeal, leaving businesses in limbo, hesitant to make more or ship more, unsure where to build factories or how high to raise prices. Some businesses had stockpiled goods to prepare for tariffs, while others canceled orders. The legal battles and potential for continued tariffs create instability for small businesses. This is an unfortunate situation for the business owners, but it is stable given the lack of death or injury.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump should maintain a tough stance on tariffs against the European Union to address the growing trade deficit. The author contends that the EU has historically engaged in protectionism, disadvantaging American products, and that the U.S. deserves reciprocal treatment. The article suggests that the EU will likely resist making substantial concessions, necessitating the imposition of tariffs to force a fairer trade relationship. The author argues this is a matter of economic security and gratitude for America's historical contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts could reduce home care services, leading to more children taking on unpaid caregiving roles for family members. Studies show that young caregivers often experience declining health and academic outcomes, while their loved ones receive untrained care. The article highlights the story of Joshua Yang, a high school senior who became his mother's caregiver after she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Schools in some states are beginning to recognize and support caregiving students, but the future of federal grants that assist caregivers remains uncertain.

Experts predict AI coding will radically change the software industry, with AI coders, project managers, and designers becoming commonplace. The progress is promising for the world of technology.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Germany experienced twice as many days of extreme heat due to climate change. The analysis, covering the period from May 1, 2024, to May 1, 2025, found that Germany had 50 days of extreme heat, with 24 of those attributed to human-induced climate change. The report also noted that 2024 was the hottest year on record, and January 2025 was the hottest January on record. The authors emphasize that the continued burning of fossil fuels has led to a significant warming of the planet.
