          <p>China's producer prices fell by 3.6% in June year-over-year, the largest drop in almost two years, indicating deepening deflationary pressures. This decline, worse than economists' predictions, stems from a persistent price war among manufacturers and sluggish consumer demand. While the consumer price index saw a slight rebound of 0.1%, analysts warn it's too early to declare an end to deflation, as overcapacity and weak property sector momentum continue to challenge the economy.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a massive 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, effectively containing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. The project utilized a method of creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then reinforced by planting drought-resistant trees. This large-scale ecological initiative is part of China's broader efforts to build a robust sand prevention and control system to combat desertification and strengthen its environmental barriers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to continue its plan to significantly reduce the federal workforce. The court lifted a lower court's injunction that had temporarily blocked the job cuts, allowing terminations to proceed while legal challenges continue.

          <p>A Tunisian court has handed down lengthy prison sentences to 21 opposition figures, including prominent leader Rached Ghannouchi, in a mass trial. Ghannouchi, head of the Ennahda party, received a 14-year term, adding to previous sentences, while others, many in exile, received up to 35 years. The charges included inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government, but defense lawyers claim they are based on false testimony from an anonymous witness.

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court alleges they are responsible for the crime against humanity of gender-based persecution targeting women and girls in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The warrants cite the severe deprivation of fundamental rights, including education and freedom of movement, though the Taliban has dismissed the ICC's move as "nonsense."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows an investigation into whether these imports threaten national security. The decision, which is expected to take effect by the end of the month, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. This tariff matches the levy on steel and aluminum and is part of the administration's broader strategy of using high tariffs to protect and promote American industries. (not investment advice)</p>

Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, leading to significant vacancy rates in meteorologist and hydrologist positions at offices across the country. While experts believe the NWS performed well in this specific event, they warn that continued cuts could compromise the agency's ability to forecast and warn the public about future weather disasters.</p>
