          <p>Storm Amy has unleashed heavy rain and strong winds across large parts of the UK and Ireland, leading to significant disruption and leaving thousands of homes without power. Gusts over 100mph were recorded, and a man tragically died in the Republic of Ireland in a weather-related incident, underscoring the storm's severe impact. The storm also set a new record for the deepest area of low pressure in the UK for October, at 947.9hPa, indicating its unusual intensity and potential for unsettled weather. Emergency services and power networks are working to reconnect 34,000 customers in Scotland and 9,000 in Northern Ireland, while railway lines and roads remain affected, highlighting the extensive ongoing efforts to restore normalcy and ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>Federal agents shot a woman in Broadview, a Chicago suburb, after their vehicles were allegedly rammed and boxed in by ten other cars near an ICE facility known for protests. The Department of Homeland Security stated that agents exited their vehicles when unable to move, and one of the drivers was reportedly armed with a semi-automatic weapon, leading agents to open fire. The injured woman, whom DHS claimed was linked to doxxing and threats against ICE, was hospitalized, with no agents reported injured. Chicago police denied jurisdiction in Broadview but responded to document the incident, emphasizing federal authorities are leading the investigation into this volatile encounter.</p>

This year's finalists, chosen by Prince William and his council including Cate Blanchett, range from Barbados's fossil-free by 2030 goal to a microplastic filter from Bristol and an "upcycled skyscraper" in Sydney. The event underscores the urgency of climate action by 2030, aligning with the upcoming COP Climate Conference in Belem.</p>

          <p>Nearly 500 people were arrested in central London during protests supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action, despite calls from ministers and police to postpone demonstrations following a deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers, Defend Our Juries, claimed around 1,000 participants, arguing the protest was necessary to prevent terror from winning and to show compassion for Palestinian victims. The Metropolitan Police deployed 1,500 officers, with many arrests requiring physical removal due to non-compliance, raising concerns from human rights groups like Amnesty International UK about the legality of the detentions. This event highlights the complex tensions between freedom of protest, public safety, and national security in a sensitive political climate.</p>

          <p>North Carolina's football team, coached by Bill Belichick, suffered an embarrassing 38-10 loss to Clemson, falling to a 2-3 season record. The defeat, following a 34-9 loss to UCF, led to widespread criticism on social media, with many questioning Belichick's coaching tenure at UNC. Pundits and fans, including Dave Portnoy and Clay Travis, labeled the situation a "complete dumpster fire," suggesting his college coaching career is tarnishing his legendary NFL legacy. Clemson, despite its own challenging season, dominated early, scoring 28 points in the first quarter, further highlighting UNC's struggles and the growing pressure on Belichick.</p>

          <p>Hearts, the Scottish Premiership leaders, are generating significant excitement among their fanbase after an unbeaten start to the season, now five points clear at the top. Head coach Derek McInnes acknowledges the fans' enthusiasm, despite cautioning against premature title talk after only six matches. The optimism is fueled by a £10 million investment from Brighton owner Tony Bloom, who boldly predicted a challenge for second place this season, a forecast gaining credibility as rivals Rangers and Celtic struggle to hit top form. While some compare their run to Aberdeen's past collapse, former players like Kevin Thomson encourage fans to embrace the current wave of positivity.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced that the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members for deployment to Chicago, despite his repeated rejections and strong opposition.

This order follows a shooting incident in Broadview involving federal agents and accusations of chemical agent deployment during ICE activity in Chicago. The governor highlighted the ongoing political tensions and criticized DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's rhetoric and social media-driven approach to federal operations in the state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to Hamas, urging them to "move quickly" on the proposed Gaza peace plan to release hostages, stating "all bets will be off" if delays occur.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling to Egypt for indirect Israel-Hamas negotiations, expected to begin soon.

          <p>The Conservative Party has unveiled an ambitious borders plan, pledging to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election. The proposals include banning asylum claims from those entering without permission and transferring appeal processes from courts to Home Office officials. The plan also involves rebranding the immigration enforcement unit as a "Removals Force" with doubled funding and a mandate to remove 150,000 people annually, a five-fold increase from current figures. This strategy aims to curb illegal migration and address concerns about the European Convention on Human Rights, aligning with similar hard-right policies seen elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Traditional piano sales have plummeted significantly, from over 300,000 in 1925 to just over 17,000 in 2024, reflecting a shift in cultural trends and economic realities. Piano technician Hannah Beckett notes that millennials' struggles with homeownership and general economic conditions contribute to fewer people purchasing large, expensive acoustic pianos. However, the instrument is finding new life through digital and hybrid pianos, which offer more affordable and compact alternatives. Experts are optimistic that this accessibility will lead to a resurgence in piano playing, especially as people seek alternatives to screen-based activities and desire deeper musical expression.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of extra police officers have been deployed across Manchester to reassure communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack, which killed two Jewish men. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed officers are working extended shifts, with support from other forces, amidst the ongoing Conservative Party Conference. The attack involved Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove a car into people outside a synagogue before being shot dead by police; he had recently been bailed after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. Six individuals remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses, while a pro-Palestinian protest also took place, drawing criticism for its timing during a period of mourning.</p>

          <p>Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has set an unwanted Premier League record by being substituted before half-time in three consecutive starts, highlighting a frustrating start to his season. After "phenomenal" play in the Champions League, he was withdrawn just 30 minutes into the West Ham game due to a "knee-to-knee" injury, following earlier shoulder issues against Leeds and Nottingham Forest. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed concern, noting Odegaard's importance as captain and his unique attacking dimension. The repeated injuries underscore a challenging period for the 26-year-old Norwegian, forcing the team to find solutions in his absence and raising questions about his fitness moving forward.</p>

The Justice Department had also filed a complaint in March 2023, accusing Rite Aid of violating federal acts by filling unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances and ignoring internal red flags.

In contrast, Mercedes' George Russell confirmed he would use the vest, acknowledging its imperfections but highlighting team improvements in car cooling. This debate underscores the challenges of driver safety and comfort in extreme conditions, with the effectiveness of the system still being evaluated in real-race environments.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Andrej Babiš's ANO movement has secured a significant victory in the Czech Republic's parliamentary election, capturing 34.7% of the vote and positioning him for a political comeback. This result could shift the country's stance from supporting Ukraine towards a more pro-Russian alignment, similar to Hungary and Slovakia, which have opposed military aid to Kyiv. Babiš, who called his win "historic," aims to form a one-party minority government and has expressed a different view on Ukraine aid. His victory reflects a broader trend of populist leaders gaining ground in Central Europe, potentially impacting EU and NATO relations, despite Babiš affirming his pro-European and pro-NATO stance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department is considering minting a special $1 coin featuring Donald Trump for the nation's 250th anniversary, with a draft design showing Trump with a clenched fist and the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." This imagery references his reaction after surviving an assassination attempt last year. Treasury Secretary Brandon Beach effectively announced the draft, despite a partial government shutdown, asserting it reflects the country's enduring spirit. While a 2020 law permits commemorative $1 coins for the semiquincentennial, legal provisions typically prohibit living persons on currency. The proposal comes as Trump's approval ratings have declined, amidst cuts to healthcare and nutrition assistance.</p>

          <p>Police in Georgia clashed with anti-government protesters attempting to storm the presidential palace in Tbilisi, using water cannons and pepper spray to disperse the crowd. The country has been in a political crisis since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in last year's parliamentary election, which the pro-European Union opposition alleges was fraudulent. The protest occurred during local elections, largely boycotted by the opposition following a government crackdown. Organizers, including opera singer Paata Burchuladze, called for the arrest of senior Georgian Dream party figures, highlighting deep-seated political instability and public discontent.</p>

His election is seen as a significant step towards greater diversity and inclusion, challenging traditional stereotypes of American Lutheranism. Curry's goals include fostering a more connected church and deepening existing denominational strategies, as the ELCA navigates challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including membership declines and theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion.</p>

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries clarified that federal law prohibits undocumented immigrants from accessing Medicare, Medicaid, or ACA subsidies, and Democrats are not seeking to change this. Republicans, including Vice President J.D. Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson, have framed the debate around illegal immigration, a politically advantageous stance for them, rather than the healthcare provisions. Democrats' funding patch primarily aims to reverse Medicaid cuts and extend popular ACA premium tax credits, which are set to expire, impacting millions of lawfully present noncitizens.</p>

Her comments appear to conflict with a White House press secretary statement that there are no "tangible plans" for ICE at the Super Bowl, although the administration maintains it will arrest and deport criminal illegal immigrants.

Through its prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, an offer exclusively for those paying out-of-pocket, as many insurers still do not cover these drugs. This move addresses the soaring prices and limited supply of GLP-1 drugs, which have led some to seek cheaper compounded versions. Costco's entry into the market aims to boost access to authentic medications, further increasing demand for these semaglutide-based treatments used for type 2 diabetes and weight management.</p>
