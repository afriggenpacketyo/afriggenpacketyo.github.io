          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors who alleged their books were used without permission to train the AI model Claude. The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, could provide around $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 books involved. This case is considered a significant precedent in the ongoing legal battles between creative industries and AI firms over the use of copyrighted material for training large language models.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the cases appear to be from separate sources and that contact tracing is underway to test individuals who may have been exposed. After decades of decline, TB cases began rising again in 2021. While not as contagious as other airborne illnesses, tuberculosis remains the world's deadliest infectious disease, targeting the lungs and spreading through the air.</p>

          <p>Kent Broussard, a 66-year-old retired accountant from Baton Rouge, has successfully auditioned for and joined the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band as a tuba player. Fulfilling a dream he has held since childhood, Broussard returned to school and relearned the instrument to compete in the rigorous audition process. Now the oldest member of the band by over four decades, he passed the same standards as his much younger peers without any special consideration. Broussard hopes his story inspires others to pursue their passions regardless of age, stating that the only failure is not trying.</p>

This proposal, which requires shareholder approval, aims to ensure Musk's long-term focus on Tesla and follows a previous $50 billion pay package that was voided by a Delaware court.

This directive follows a cease-and-desist order from the Insurance Commissioner regarding the plan's use of a smoke-damage standard that courts have already deemed unlawful.

The annuity option is presented as a safer bet that makes it more difficult to overspend quickly.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a last-minute change to their pitching rotation, scratching scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow due to back tightness. Two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani offered to take the mound on short notice, just two days after his own planned start was postponed because of an illness. Manager Dave Roberts praised Ohtani's willingness to step up for the team, which is hoping to rebound from a recent series sweep. The team is optimistic that Glasnow's back issue is not serious and hopes he can return to pitch early next week.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that China is leveraging organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to build a multipolar world, offering economic and political alternatives to the Western-led system. Originally a security forum, the SCO now includes 40% of the world's population and nearly a quarter of the global GDP, with strong growth momentum from members like China and India. The expansion to include nations like Iran suggests the bloc is maturing from a regional pact into a significant platform that is compelling the United States to re-evaluate its global strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration encountered a difficult week marked by multiple setbacks across different fronts. A federal court ruling challenged the legality of his global tariff policy, a foundational element of his economic agenda, while new data showed a contraction in the labor market. Diplomatically, efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine appeared to stall. At home, the administration faced bipartisan criticism over its public health policies and handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files, alongside several other unfavorable court decisions on immigration and military deployment.</p>

One incident cited involved him opining that a pregnant woman with a drug history would have a 'meth baby.' Monguia did not contest the admonishment and expressed remorse for his actions.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian fashion designer who passed away at 91, is remembered for transforming the Hollywood red carpet from a chaotic fashion landscape into a global runway.

His unstructured, elegant suits defined an era of 'effortless elegance' for both men and women, harnessing celebrity power to build a global empire and forever changing how Hollywood presents itself to the world.</p>

          <p>At the Reform UK conference, leader Nigel Farage capitalized on the political turmoil within the Labour Party, following Angela Rayner's resignation and a subsequent cabinet reshuffle. Farage delivered an impromptu speech declaring the Labour government 'deep in crisis' and unfit to govern, positioning Reform UK as the party 'on the rise.' He argued that the instability could lead to an earlier-than-expected general election and called for his party to ramp up campaigning efforts. The conference also featured appearances from former Conservative figures, signaling Reform's growing influence in British politics.</p>

          <p>A major scandal has erupted in Australia after an independent consumer group found that several popular sunscreens failed to provide their claimed level of SPF protection. The most significant failure was a product from Ultra Violette, which tested at SPF 4 instead of its advertised SPF 50+, leading to a product recall. The findings have caused a public backlash in a country with the world's highest skin cancer rates, prompting an investigation by the medical watchdog, the Therapeutic Goods Association. The issue raises questions about sunscreen testing standards and regulation globally.</p>

          <p>Neil Hopper, a vascular surgeon, has been jailed for insurance fraud after it was revealed he deliberately froze his own legs to necessitate their amputation, a procedure he later falsely attributed to sepsis from a camping trip. The court heard that Hopper had a long-standing sexual interest in amputation and body dysphoria, messaging an associate 'It's going to be awesome being a double amputee.' After the surgery, he fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurance companies and gained media attention for his story. The deception was uncovered during a police investigation into an extreme body modification ring.</p>

Despite this progress, the industry now faces new challenges, including potential U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions that could hinder its continued growth and competition on the global stage.
