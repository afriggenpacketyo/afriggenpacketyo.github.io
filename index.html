          <p>Karmelo Anthony, accused of fatally stabbing Austin Metcalf, will graduate from Centennial High School in Frisco, Texas, but will not participate in the graduation ceremony. School officials clarified that while Anthony will receive his diploma, he is prohibited from attending the ceremony due to the serious criminal offense. Supporters of Anthony claim he acted in self-defense, comparing his case to those of Kyle Rittenhouse and Daniel Penny, while the victim's family expresses dismay. The case has ignited racial tensions and public debate, with conflicting narratives surrounding the events leading to Metcalf's death, though the legal team is preparing for an uphill battle claiming self-defense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new tariffs on shipments from China and Hong Kong valued under $800, potentially impacting American consumers and global trade. A previous loophole allowed these goods to enter the U.S. without import duties, leading to a surge in packages from Chinese companies like Shein and Temu. The new tariffs, initially set at 120% but reduced to 54% after trade negotiations, are expected to increase costs for shoppers and disrupt the economics of global trade. Chinese factory owners are already reporting fewer orders and considering relocating to countries with lower wages and export duties.</p>

          <p>Seventeen family members of Sinaloa Cartel leaders, including the ex-wife of El Chapo, have reportedly crossed into the United States, suggesting a potential deal with the Trump administration. Mexico's security secretary confirmed the reports, indicating that the family members of Ovidio Guzmán López, one of El Chapo’s sons, surrendered to American authorities as part of a negotiation or plea bargain. Ovidio Guzmán López plans to plead guilty to federal drug charges, making him the first of El Chapo’s sons to acknowledge guilt in a U.S. federal courthouse, potentially implicating others in the organization. The U.S. Department of Justice has also announced new charges against men accused of being Sinaloa Cartel leaders, the first since President Trump designated it a terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its voice assistant, Siri, eavesdropped on users' private conversations and shared them with third-party businesses. The lawsuit claimed that Siri-enabled devices, including iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple TVs, unintentionally recorded confidential communications, leading to targeted advertising. Consumers who owned these devices between September 2014 and December 2024 and experienced unintended Siri activations during private conversations are eligible to file a claim. Eligible users can file claims for up to five devices, with a maximum payout of $100, with payments expected to be distributed later this year pending final approval.</p>

The sanctions had effectively cut Syria out of the international banking system and isolated it from the global economy. Trump also met with Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Shara, a former rebel leader who spearheaded the campaign that toppled Bashar al-Assad, marking the first time in 25 years the leaders of the two countries had met. Trump urged al-Shara to reach a peace accord with Israel, expel foreign terrorists, help the United States fight the Islamic State, and take over detention centers holding Islamic State militants.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man was arrested after months of planning an attack on a U.S. Army site in Warren, Michigan, with the FBI saying the man was planning a mass shooting at the Army’s Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command on behalf of the Islamic State group. The man was unaware that he had been scheming with two undercover FBI employees, who recorded audio and video images of their meetings with him, including handwritten diagrams of the site. The plan involved sending one of the undercover agents into TACOM with Molotov cocktails and assault-style weapons.</p>

          <p>Nissan is cutting approximately 15% of its global workforce, or about 20,000 employees, after reporting a $4.5 billion loss for the fiscal year. The automaker plans to reduce the number of its auto plants from 17 to 10 as part of its recovery plan, which includes reducing costs by $3.4 billion. CEO Ivan Espinosa cited slipping vehicle sales in China and other nations, as well as restructuring costs and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, as factors contributing to the company's financial struggles. Nissan aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.</p>

          <p>California's insurance regulator has approved State Farm's request to increase homeowners' insurance premiums by 17% to rebuild capital following the Los Angeles wildfires. The insurer argued the rate hike was necessary to avoid a financial crisis that could force it to drop more policies. The decision comes as California seeks to retain insurers in the state amid increasing wildfire risks, with the new rates taking effect in June. In exchange, State Farm will receive a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company and halt some non-renewals through the end of the year.</p>
