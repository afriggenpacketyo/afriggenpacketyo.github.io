          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traveled to Beijing to participate in a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.  He will join Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The event occurs amid concerns from Ukraine and the West about the three nations' collaboration, particularly regarding Russia's war in Ukraine.  Western governments accuse North Korea of providing significant military support to Russia, while China is seen as a key source of supplies and economic assistance for Moscow.</p>

          <p>The European Union is advised to accept defeat in the solar panel market, conceding to China's technological lead.  French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry highlights the significant gap, stating that Europe no longer has a competitive solar panel industry.  The article suggests that this is less concerning than energy dependencies like natural gas, since solar panels are static.  The overall sentiment reflects a pragmatic acceptance of China's market dominance in this specific technology.</p>

          <p>Chinese scholars are criticizing what they perceive as Western “historical nihilism” in the portrayal of World War II, particularly concerning the downplaying of China's contributions to the war effort.  Professor Liu Bensen from Shandong Normal University argues that a Western-centric lens distorts the narrative, exaggerating Western contributions and neglecting the significance of the Eastern theater.  This reflects China's broader effort to reshape historical accounts of World War II, emphasizing its role and seeking greater recognition for its wartime sacrifices.</p>
