The Scottish Police Federation questioned his impartiality due to private meetings with Bayoh's family. Bracadale cited a loss of confidence from core participants, acknowledging that criticisms persisted despite his earlier decision to continue. The inquiry investigates the 2015 death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody, including the aftermath, investigation, and potential racial factors.</p>

Her journey highlights the challenges victims face, as initial charges were declined despite her cooperation.

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm in the Atlantic this year, has formed in the Caribbean, posing potential risks to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Currently located south of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the storm is expected to turn north and northwest, potentially stalling near Haiti and Jamaica as a Category 1 hurricane. Heavy rainfall and significant flash flooding, with the danger of landslides, are anticipated for Hispaniola. While unlikely to impact the mainland U.S., its path remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Dario Amodei, CEO of AI startup Anthropic, has responded to David Sacks, President Trump's AI and crypto czar, regarding claims that the company promotes 'woke AI' policies. Amodei stated Anthropic aligns with the Trump administration on key AI policy areas and seeks collaboration across the political spectrum to ensure AI benefits Americans. The controversy arose after a co-founder's essay sparked debate on AI regulation, with Sacks accusing Anthropic of a 'regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.' Amodei clarified the company's preference for a uniform federal approach over fragmented state laws.</p>

          <p>Weighted vests are gaining popularity as a fitness trend to intensify workouts, but medical experts advise caution regarding their use. Dr. Jon LaPook notes that while vests can increase calorie burn and heart workload, individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor due to the added stress. Studies on bone health benefits are inconclusive, but they may help prevent falls by strengthening muscles, provided the vest doesn't cause imbalance. Users should start with 5% of their body weight, wear it briefly, and ensure proper fit to avoid joint stress.</p>

These premium tax credits, boosted during the pandemic, are critical for lowering out-of-pocket costs for marketplace insurance. A KFF analysis suggests premiums could more than double without them. Individuals like Doug Butchart, whose wife has ALS, and Nancy Murphy, a type 1 diabetic, fear they may be forced into less comprehensive plans or unable to afford coverage.

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a New York man pardoned by President Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, has been charged with making terroristic threats against House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Moynihan was arrested after allegedly sending text messages stating his intent to 'eliminate' Jeffries at an upcoming NYC event. Prosecutors' filings detail Moynihan's past conviction for obstructing an official proceeding during the riot, where he was among the first to breach barricades and entered the Senate floor.

Despite rising prices, Wawa's customer loyalty remains strong, particularly in the breakfast category, where its morning meal traffic increased by 5% year-over-year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Methane (CH4), a colorless and odorless component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas, trapping 84 times more heat than CO2 over a 20-year period. While CO2 persists for centuries, methane dissipates in about 12 years, yet it contributes 20-30% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. Natural sources like thawing permafrost contribute, but 60% of emissions stem from human activities, including agriculture, landfills, and the energy sector. Solutions, such as fixing leaks in oil and gas infrastructure, could cut emissions by 75%, with regulations like the EU's mandating routine measurement and rapid repair.</p>
