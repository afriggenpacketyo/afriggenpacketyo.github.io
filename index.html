          <p>In the closing arguments of Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, federal prosecutors described him as the leader of a criminal enterprise who used "power, violence and fear." Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik argued that Combs leveraged his fame, wealth, and employees to facilitate and conceal extensive abuse, believing he was above the law. The prosecution's case, built on testimony from 34 witnesses over seven weeks, accuses Combs of racketeering and sex trafficking, for which he faces a potential sentence of 15 years to life if convicted. The defense is scheduled to present its closing arguments next, with jury deliberations expected to begin shortly thereafter.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared a significant victory over Israel and claimed to have delivered "a big slap in the face" to the United States. In his first public remarks since a ceasefire, he asserted that Iranian missiles had crushed the Israeli government and caused major damage to military targets, despite evidence showing minimal impact and the interception of most rockets. In contrast, U.S. and Israeli intelligence assess that recent strikes set back Iran's nuclear program by years, with an Iranian official acknowledging serious damage to key facilities. Iran has also moved to cease cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, raising international concern.</p>

In a conversation with NPR, he reflected on a New York Times piece he authored titled, "Autism Rates have Increased 60-Fold. I Played a Role in That." Dr. Frances explained how changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) broadened the definition of autism, leading to more individuals being diagnosed.

          <p>President Trump held a White House event to rally support for his major tax-and-spending package, urging lawmakers to pass the legislation ahead of his July 4th deadline. The bill, which includes extensions of previous tax cuts and new funding for immigration enforcement, faces an uncertain future in the Senate due to concerns from moderate Republicans and a recent procedural setback. The Senate parliamentarian ruled against a key Medicaid-related provision, potentially increasing the bill's projected $4.2 trillion addition to the national deficit. Democrats have strongly opposed the legislation, citing deep cuts to programs like Medicaid and food assistance.</p>

          <p>The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for 10 games for violating the league's Personal Conduct Policy, following an investigation into at least 16 sexual misconduct allegations by massage therapists. The suspension will begin on August 26, and Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May, will be eligible for reinstatement in November. Tucker has consistently denied the allegations but has reportedly accepted the resolution to move forward. The Ravens organization had previously described the accusations as "serious" and "concerning," stating his release was a "football decision" pending the outcome of the NFL's inquiry.</p>

Patient groups and medical professionals express concern over the slow progress, highlighting the physical and mental toll on individuals waiting for care, some of whom live in constant pain.

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated it may attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a country other than his native El Salvador if he is released from jail. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in what the government called an "administrative error," violating a court order that barred his removal to that specific country due to fears of gang persecution. After a judge ordered his return to the U.S., he was jailed on federal smuggling charges in Tennessee. His case continues to navigate a complex legal battle across multiple jurisdictions, with his lawyers fighting for his return to Maryland and protection from further deportation.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk, Mary Catchpole, has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that could potentially cure her rare and life-threatening inherited immune disorder. The condition, Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS), was identified in 2013 partly through research involving her family, who have lost multiple members to the disease. The drug works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function correctly. This breakthrough represents a remarkable journey from disease discovery to an approved NHS treatment in just 12 years, offering new hope to the small number of affected patients.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower complaint alleges that a high-ranking Justice Department official, Emil Bove III, suggested the DOJ should consider telling courts to "fuck you" and ignore orders blocking deportations. The complaint, filed by a fired career lawyer, highlights internal resistance to defying court mandates, using the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia as a key example. This analysis suggests that the administration's aggressive deportation goals are unrealistic, leading to desperate measures and conflicts with the judiciary.

SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler stated the USAID fraud, where a contracting officer received over $1 million in bribes to steer contracts, reflects "systemic failures" that demand immediate action. The audit will review all grant-awarding authority within the SBA's business development program dating back to 2010 to prevent similar abuses. This move comes after the USAID scandal involved an $800 million contract being awarded to a company previously flagged for a lack of business integrity.</p>

          <p>Nike announced that new tariffs could cost it approximately $1 billion in the current fiscal year, a significant challenge as it navigates a difficult turnaround. The company's fourth-quarter profits fell by 86% due to efforts to clear old inventory and reset its business strategy, though it still beat Wall Street's lowered expectations. CEO Elliott Hill stated the worst financial impacts are now behind them and expects business results to improve. As part of its mitigation strategy, Nike plans to reduce its manufacturing presence in China and has announced a renewed partnership to sell select products on Amazon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite protests from environmental and Indigenous groups, construction is underway for a migrant detention facility in Florida's Big Cypress National Preserve. Dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials, the site will house up to 1,000 people in tents and is being funded with federal hurricane relief money, a move critics call a "grotesque mix of cruelty and political theater." The Miccosukee and Seminole tribes, for whom the land is sacred and traditional homeland, have strongly opposed the project. They argue the area is a vital cultural refuge that should be protected, not used for a political stunt during hurricane season.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images providing strong evidence of a previously unknown exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is estimated to be the mass of Saturn and orbits a young, nearby star. Scientists utilized a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to suppress the star's bright glare, revealing the faint object nearby. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet, potentially shaping the debris disk of its host star.</p>

Mamdani's campaign, focused on affordability with bold proposals like free child care and rent freezes, has drawn both praise and concern from fellow Democrats.

In his announcement, he contrasted his administration's achievementsâ€”including balanced budgets, credit upgrades, and a higher minimum wageâ€”with the policies of the Trump administration. Pritzker has been a vocal critic of President Trump and is seen by some as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, though he declined to commit to serving a full third term as governor.

While President Trump claimed the program was "obliterated," analysis suggests a more complex outcome. The heavily fortified Fordo enrichment site was targeted with powerful bunker-busting bombs and is believed to be inoperable, though the full impact is hard to confirm. Above-ground facilities at Isfahan and Natanz were destroyed, but underground halls were more difficult to neutralize, and it is unknown if Iran successfully moved its stockpile of highly enriched uranium before the attacks.</p>
