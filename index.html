          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chavín people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists analyzed artifacts, including "snuff tubes," found at Chavín de Huántar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and discovered traces of hallucinogenic substances like DMT and tobacco. These findings indicate that consuming psychoactive drugs was a tightly controlled ritual, likely reserved for a select few, reinforcing the social hierarchy.</p>

Kessler emphasizes the need for additional interventions like healthier eating, exercise, and behavioral therapies, and calls for more research on the long-term use and safety of these drugs.

The jet was landing on the flight deck of the Truman on Tuesday when the aircraft’s arrestment system failed. The two pilots aboard ejected and sustained minor injuries. This incident follows a collision with a merchant ship and a previous incident where a jet was shot down by the U.S.S. Gettysburg.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares jumped nearly 7% after the company indicated sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the second half of the year due to phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit, although sales of Wegovy were slightly below expectations. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen believes the end of a drug shortage ruling by the FDA will allow sales to pick up again, and the company is pursuing companies that unlawfully distribute copycat drugs.

The technology, which involves using ultraviolet light at wavelengths of 200 to 235 nanometers, can kill the vast majority of airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes. A new development involves secondary harmonics using aluminum nitrate crystals to create cost-effective lamps. While challenges remain, new research is making the author tentatively more optimistic that the ozone effects of far-UVC are not concerningly large.</p>
