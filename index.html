        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations, which have seen clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address what the White House is calling "lawlessness" in California. California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and said it would "only escalate tensions." The protests follow ICE operations and arrests in Los Angeles County, sparking calls for "mass mobilization" and the removal of ICE from the area. The deployment is under Title 10 authority, a waiver of the Posse Comitatus Act. The situation remains tense as local officials express concern over the federal government's actions and their potential impact on public trust. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other politicians have condemned the shooting of Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe, who is fighting for his life after sustaining three gunshot wounds. Rubio blamed the assassination attempt on "violent leftist rhetoric" originating from the Colombian government, while Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno called it a "vile attack on democracy." Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Uribe's chief opponent, ordered an investigation and canceled a trip to France, citing the "seriousness of the events." Authorities are investigating the attack, with Colombia's Ministry of Defense offering a substantial reward for information.</p>

          <p>Political analyst Charles M. Blow reflects on the shifting mood in America, noting a decline in pluralism and racial justice efforts since President Trump's return to office. He highlights the "Great Blackout," citing examples such as the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural and the removal of Harriet Tubman's image from a National Park Service page. Blow observes a dampening effect on Juneteenth celebrations, with multiple cities canceling events, and argues that America's youngest national holiday is now caught in the crossfire of culture wars. The article emphasizes the importance of preserving Black history and symbols in the face of these challenges.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, has vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying environmental activist Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip, citing the need to maintain its naval blockade to prevent Hamas from importing arms.

Meanwhile, Palestinians report that at least five people were killed by Israeli fire near aid distribution points in Gaza, with the Israeli military claiming it fired warning shots at people approaching its forces.

          <p>Protests have erupted in Los Angeles following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to multiple arrests and the deployment of National Guard troops.

President Trump has ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A.

Zelenskyy believes that only "hard pressure" led by the U.S. and joined by European allies would make Putin "pragmatic" in his thinking and bring an end to the war. He endorsed an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Trump's "playground" characterization of the war, and called for US sanctions and "intermediaries" to facilitate a ceasefire.

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the coast of Southwestern Mexico, with the National Hurricane Center forecasting it to strengthen into a hurricane on Monday. While there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, the storm is expected to bring two to four inches of rainfall to portions of Mexico's western states, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate sea swells with life-threatening surf and rip currents along the southwestern coast. NOAA officials have predicted a 60% chance of an "above-normal" hurricane season, with 13 to 19 named storms expected.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist explains that a sour tone often signals contempt, a predictor of divorce, and that arguments about family often reflect misalignments and unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication styles also contribute to relationship problems. The article offers strategies for couples to navigate these conflicts, such as naming the effect of a condescending tone, reassuring one another in family disputes, and redistributing household tasks equitably.</p>

The poll also indicates concerns about the program's economic impact and the potential for legal residents to be mistakenly deported.
