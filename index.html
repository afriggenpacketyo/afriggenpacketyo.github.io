          <h2>Federal Court Hears Lawsuit Challenging President's Authority to Impose Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:47:01 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration's trade policy is facing a significant legal challenge in a federal appeals court, which is hearing arguments in a lawsuit filed by small businesses and several states. The plaintiffs argue that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs without congressional approval. This case is pivotal as a ruling against the administration could curtail the president's power to unilaterally set tariffs, potentially impacting ongoing and future trade negotiations. The White House maintains that the use of these powers is legal and necessary for national security and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Median Home Price Reaches New Record High in June</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:45:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The median price for an existing home in the United States hit a record $435,300 in June, marking 24 consecutive months of annual price growth. According to the National Association of Realtors, this rise is driven by a persistent undersupply of homes, which continues to lag behind population growth despite low sales volumes. High prices combined with mortgage rates over 6.5% have pushed many potential buyers out of the market, though demand from affluent, cash-paying buyers keeps prices elevated. Monthly mortgage payments for a median-priced home are now significantly higher than they were at the start of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his government will formally recognize Palestine as a state in September unless Israel takes significant steps toward a ceasefire in Gaza. These steps include halting West Bank annexation and committing to a two-state solution peace process. The move follows a similar announcement by France and is intended to protect the viability of a two-state solution, which Foreign Minister David Lammy stated is "in peril." Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned the decision, calling it a "reward for Hamas" that undermines hostage release efforts.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk saw its shares fall over 20% after lowering its 2025 sales and profit forecasts, a decision the company attributes to increased competition from compounded, or copycat, versions of its popular weight-loss drug Wegovy.

Despite efforts to curb the sale of unauthorized compounded drugs, their lower cost continues to attract consumers.

          <p>Three private seat holders at London's Royal Albert Hall have lost a High Court bid for £500,000 in damages against the venue's operator. The plaintiffs claimed the hall's corporation had unlawfully excluded them from more performances than permitted by the rules governing their historic seating rights. These rights, dating back to the venue's construction in 1871, allow private members to attend a majority of events. The judge dismissed the request for a summary judgment, ruling that the complex dispute over property rights and historical governance requires a full trial to be properly resolved.</p>

          <p>During a four-day visit to Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump met with First Minister John Swinney, discussing the potential exemption of Scotch whisky from U.S. tariffs and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Swinney urged the president to use his influence to secure a ceasefire, while also advocating for the Scottish whisky industry, which faces a 10% tariff. Trump, who was in Scotland to open a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort, also commented on North Sea oil and gas, suggesting taxes on the industry were too high before departing for Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," a critical scientific conclusion that greenhouse gases threaten public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. This finding has served as the legal basis for nearly all major U.S. climate regulations, including emissions standards for vehicles and power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as "the largest deregulatory action in the history of America," claiming it would save Americans over a trillion dollars. Environmental groups have condemned the decision as illegal and dangerous, vowing to challenge it in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months into his second term, President Donald Trump's job approval rating has fallen significantly among young Americans aged 18-29, dropping from 55% to 28%. According to a CBS News analysis, this decline is steepest among less partisan and politically unengaged young voters, particularly young men. A growing majority of young people now say the president's policies are making them financially worse off and that he is focusing too much on issues like tariffs and deportations instead of lowering prices. This shift reverses the post-inauguration optimism and could impact Republican prospects in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

This move would see the nation's largest credit card issuer take over the high-profile partnership, while allowing Goldman Sachs to exit its troubled foray into consumer credit cards. For Goldman, divesting the business would help it move past a period marked by unexpected losses and regulatory scrutiny. For Apple, partnering with the more experienced JPMorgan could bring greater stability and discipline to the rapidly grown but challenging credit card program. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite challenges like high interest rates and construction costs, investors are showing strong demand for the sector.

UN agencies have blamed the crisis on Israel's blockade and military operations, which have severely restricted aid.

          <p>As the World Health Organization warns that a famine is unfolding in Gaza, this article explains the physiological process of starvation. When deprived of food, the body first consumes its carbohydrate and fat stores before beginning to break down its own muscle and organ proteins for energy. This final, catastrophic phase leads to severe muscle wasting, a weakened immune system, and organ failure, with death often resulting from infection or cardiac arrest. Children, pregnant people, and the elderly are most vulnerable, facing long-term health consequences if they survive a period of severe malnutrition.</p>
