          <h2>China's Economy Faces Deflationary Pressure Amid Weak Domestic Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:15:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are urging Chinese authorities to implement bolder measures to combat a persistent deflationary spiral, as key economic indicators show falling prices for several consecutive months. The country's GDP deflator has been negative since mid-2023, and consumer prices continue to drop, signaling a significant economic challenge. Experts from institutions like CICC argue that the root cause is weak domestic demand, driven by downturns in the property and financial sectors and declining household income expectations. Previous attempts to address the issue by cutting supply and reducing overcapacity have proven insufficient.</p>

          <p>After making landfall as a tropical storm, Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression but continued to cause significant disruption across the southeastern United States. The system brought heavy rainfall to North Carolina, leading to severe flash flooding, numerous water rescues, and road collapses. As it moved northeast over Virginia, flood watches were extended to several mid-Atlantic states, including Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. The National Weather Service reported near-record river cresting, and forecasters warned of dangerous surf and rip currents along the coast for the coming days.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas have led to the deaths of at least 81 people, with another 41 reported missing as of Monday. The majority of fatalities occurred in Kerr County, where a Christian girls' summer camp was inundated when the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. The large-scale search-and-rescue operation is now transitioning into a recovery effort, with officials acknowledging the death toll is likely to climb. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, and more rain is forecasted, potentially complicating recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. have developed tiny robots, called "Pipebots," designed to navigate inside water mains to find and fix leaks without disruptive excavation. These robots are equipped with cameras and acoustic sensors to identify cracks in aging infrastructure, a significant issue in countries like the U.K. where water systems are old and waste millions of gallons daily. This innovation is part of a broader, government-supported initiative to modernize infrastructure management. The technology holds the potential to make maintenance more efficient and affordable globally.</p>

In response, Huawei stated its model was independently developed and trained on its proprietary Ascend AI hardware.

          <p>This opinion piece by Robert Reich argues that the Trump administration's pressure on universities, such as forcing the resignation of the University of Virginia's president over DEI policies, is part of an authoritarian playbook. The author compares these actions to Hungarian President Viktor Orbán's methods for establishing an "illiberal democracy" by controlling key institutions, including the military, courts, media, and finally, academia. Reich contends that the stated reasons for these interventions, like antisemitism or DEI, are pretexts for a broader, anti-intellectual agenda aimed at suppressing independent thought and consolidating power, as an educated populace is the greatest obstacle to tyranny.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has commenced in Massachusetts challenging the Trump administration's policy of targeting noncitizen students for deportation based on their pro-Palestinian views. The lawsuit, brought by the American Association of University Professors and others, argues this "ideological-deportation policy" is unconstitutional and has created a climate of fear on campuses, chilling free speech. The government contends it has the authority to deport noncitizens whose presence it deems a threat to U.S. foreign policy.

Experts, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and investor Ray Dalio, warn that persistent deficits could trigger a crisis, impacting markets, the economy, and national security. The report outlines potential consequences such as higher inflation, rising interest rates that crowd out private investment, and a diminished capacity for the government to respond to emergencies. Some analysts estimate the U.S. has less than 20 years to correct its fiscal trajectory before facing a potential default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, "Bring the House Down," offers a sharp and entertaining satire of the arts criticism world, set during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The story follows two critics: the acerbic and influential Alex Lyons, and his junior colleague, Sophie Ridgen, who narrates the tale. Alex's career begins to unravel after he gives a devastating one-star review to a show and then sleeps with its star, who subsequently turns her performance into a public takedown of him. The review finds the novel to be a compelling read, though it notes that the charisma of the central characters is sometimes more told than shown.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value saw a significant drop in pre-market trading amid investor concerns over CEO Elon Musk's increasing involvement in politics. The decline followed Musk's announcement of a new political party and a public feud with President Trump, sparking fears that these activities could distract him or invite political retribution against his companies. Analysts noted a sense of "exhaustion" among shareholders who prefer Musk to focus on Tesla during a critical period for the electric carmaker. The political turmoil adds another layer of pressure to the company's stock, which is already navigating a consumer backlash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden nation of which none of them are citizens. This unprecedented action followed a protracted legal battle where human rights advocates argued the move was punitive and unconstitutional, given the dangers in South Sudan. The administration proceeded after a Supreme Court order cleared the way, framing the deportation as a victory for national security. The men, who hail from countries in Asia and Latin America, had already served criminal sentences in the U.S.</p>

During the challenge, Black had to overcome numerous jellyfish stings and difficult currents that tested him mentally and physically.

The facility offers traditional treatment but also provides clean syringes, pipes, and naloxone for those not ready to quit drugs, aiming to prevent overdoses and build trust. This approach contrasts with the Trump administration's focus on forced treatment and recovery-first mandates. While controversial, proponents argue harm reduction saves lives, improves public health, and can be a gateway to long-term recovery for a vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to inform countries this week of the new tariff rates that will take effect on August 1, following a 90-day pause. President Trump has used the threat of high tariffs to pressure nations into bilateral trade deals, so far securing agreements with only the U.K. and Vietnam. This unorthodox approach creates uncertainty for U.S. businesses, as tariffs are taxes they pay on imported goods, often passing the costs to consumers. While the deals may reduce foreign trade barriers, they also result in significantly higher costs on goods from key trading partners compared to pre-Trump levels.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, hundreds of thousands, and possibly over a million, of unplugged and undocumented "orphan" oil and gas wells pose a significant environmental risk. These defunct wells, abandoned by their operators, can leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other toxins into the air and water. A $4.7 billion federal program is now funding efforts to locate and plug these wells, but the scale of the problem is immense. The article explores the challenges of finding these wells, determining responsibility for them, and the high cost of properly sealing them to prevent further environmental damage.</p>

          <p>A growing controversy, amplified by social media influencers and public figures, questions the healthfulness of common seed oils like canola and soybean oil. Critics argue these oils, often processed with chemicals and heat, promote chronic inflammation due to their high omega-6 fatty acid content. However, many nutrition scientists counter that extensive research shows replacing saturated fats with these oils improves health outcomes and does not increase inflammatory markers in the body. While most experts agree on reducing ultra-processed foods, where seed oils are prevalent, they maintain that the oils themselves are not the primary cause of health issues.</p>
