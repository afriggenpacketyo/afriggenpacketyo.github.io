          <p>Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska is voicing strong opposition to President Trump's plan to import beef from Argentina, arguing it will harm American cattle ranchers without significantly lowering consumer prices. The proposal is part of a broader U.S. financial assistance package for Argentina, whose president is a close Trump ally. Fischer and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association warn that government intervention will undermine the one stable sector of the U.S. agricultural economy, pulling the rug out from under ranchers who are just breaking even.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat skyrocketed over 140% after being added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, triggering a significant short squeeze. The stock, which had fallen to penny-stock status after years of poor performance, saw its value jump from 65 cents to around $2 per share in a matter of days. This dramatic rally, further fueled by a new distribution deal with Walmart, is seen by some as a sign of market froth, where investors are piling into speculative assets despite elevated valuations.

          <p>A coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs has launched the "Take Back Tesla" campaign, urging shareholders to vote against a new, nearly $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The group argues the proposal is outrageous, citing concerns that Musk's political activities have damaged Tesla's brand and that the plan doesn't require him to focus on the automaker. This shareholder push comes as Tesla is also appealing a Delaware court's decision that invalidated Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 due to improper board procedures.</p>

The prospect of Putin visiting EU soil for the first time since the Ukraine invasion, and since being indicted for war crimes, had caused significant unease. European leaders stressed that such a meeting would only be acceptable if it led to an immediate ceasefire, while logistical and legal challenges, such as Putin's arrest warrant and airspace restrictions, loomed over the potential summit.</p>

          <p>Norwegian Cruise Line has announced it will discontinue the inclusion of its onboard beverage packages at its private island, Great Stirrup Cay, starting March 1, 2026. Instead, the company plans to introduce a separate, island-specific beverage package that will be available for purchase. While complimentary drinks like water and iced tea will remain available, the change has been met with disappointment from some customers on social media, who view it as a reduction in value for their cruise fare and a sign of cost-cutting measures by the company.</p>

          <p>Recent analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, with businesses passing a significant portion of the costs to consumers. Product categories like furniture, car parts, and electronics have seen notable price hikes. Economists found that tariffs added approximately 0.5 percentage points to the headline inflation rate between June and August. While the full impact is still unfolding, the research suggests these trade policies are already exerting measurable upward pressure on the prices paid by American households.

However, even those with higher incomes may still qualify if their disposable income is minimal after accounting for specific allowed expenses like housing and taxes.

          <p>A coroner has concluded that neglect at a Manchester mental health unit contributed to the death of 22-year-old Cerys Lupton-Jones, who took her own life in May 2022. The inquest found that staff at Park House, run by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, failed to properly monitor her after a previous suicide attempt and falsified observation records. The coroner described the care as a "shambles" and stated that if staff had stayed with her, her death might have been prevented, highlighting a gross failure to provide basic medical attention.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels are expected to hire former player Kurt Suzuki as their next manager, according to multiple media reports. Suzuki, who concluded his 16-year playing career with the Angels in 2022, has since served as a special assistant to the team's general manager. He will become the fifth manager to lead the team since 2018, replacing Ron Washington, who missed a significant part of the 2025 season due to heart surgery. The move comes as the organization seeks to end a streak of ten consecutive losing seasons.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 14:38:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News medical correspondent examined the fitness trend of using weighted vests to enhance workouts, noting both potential benefits and risks. Wearing a vest can increase calorie burn and improve cardiovascular workload, but it also functions as a mini stress test on the heart, making it important for individuals with underlying health conditions to consult a doctor first. To avoid injury, it's recommended to start with a light weight (around 5% of body weight) and ensure the vest fits properly to prevent undue stress on joints in the knees, ankles, and hips.</p>

          <p>A Barstow man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in the death of his 2-year-old son, Xavier, whose body was found in a flood channel last month. Initially, the death was reported as a tragic accident after the father and son were separated when their car was swept away by floodwaters. However, after a month-long investigation, detectives gathered evidence that led them to secure an arrest warrant for the father, Brandon Padilla-Aguilera. Authorities have not yet released details on what led them to suspect foul play in the child's death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed softening its landmark anti-deforestation law (EUDR), which was designed to ban imports of products like coffee, soy, and palm oil linked to deforestation. The proposed changes, which face opposition from environmental groups but are supported by some trading partners, would move the implementation deadline for large companies to the end of 2025 and reduce paperwork requirements. Specifically, the obligation to submit a deforestation statement would be limited to the initial importers, rather than all companies in the supply chain, in an effort to reduce the administrative burden.</p>

          <p>A third survivor has resigned from the advisory panel for the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, stating the process feels "scripted and predetermined." The survivor, identified as Elizabeth, joins two others who recently quit, raising concerns about the inquiry's ability to gain the trust of victims. The resignations highlight frustrations over delays in appointing a chairperson and fears that the inquiry's scope is being improperly widened to dilute its focus on the specific issue of organized grooming gangs, thereby undermining its original purpose as recommended by Baroness Casey.</p>

While there is no evidence linking the two, the methods used in the Paris heist—speed, precision, and a bold approach—are hallmarks of the infamous gang. The Pink Panthers, known for their military-style planning and dramatic getaways, targeted high-end jewelers and museums across Europe and Asia, carrying out some of the most spectacular thefts in modern history.</p>

Wolfe compared the current enthusiasm to the dot-com era, suggesting that investors are overlooking risks and that the smarter strategy is to look for value in overlooked sectors.
