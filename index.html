          <h2>German Constitutional Court Rules Against State Culpability in 2012 US Drone Strike</h2>

          <p>Germany's highest court has dismissed a complaint from two Yemeni men who lost relatives in a 2012 US drone strike, ruling the German state was not complicit. The plaintiffs argued that the US Ramstein air base in Germany was essential for relaying signals for the attack, making Germany partially responsible. However, the court determined that while Germany has a duty to protect human rights abroad, the connection to German state authority was insufficient in this case. This decision concludes a decade-long legal battle over the base's role in US drone operations.</p>

          <p>Hard drives containing unreleased music, tour plans, and set lists for Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' tour were stolen from a rental vehicle in Atlanta. The theft occurred just days before the artist's concert series in the city, targeting a car used by her choreographer and a dancer. According to the police report, other stolen items included a laptop and designer clothes, with authorities using tracking data from the electronics to pursue leads. An arrest warrant has been issued, but it is unclear if the sensitive materials, which are highly protected by the artist to prevent leaks, have been recovered.</p>

          <p>The price disparity between the Hong Kong-listed (H shares) and mainland-listed (A shares) stocks of dual-listed Chinese firms has narrowed to its smallest point since June 2020. According to a Hang Seng gauge, H shares are now trading at a 22% discount, compared to an average of 29% over the past year. Analysts attribute this trend to a weaker US dollar prompting global investors to diversify into the Hong Kong market. Additionally, mainland investors are increasingly buying H shares to gain exposure to major technology companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BRICS bloc, now expanded, is projecting increased confidence and positioning itself as an alternative to Western-led global dominance, notably calling for de-dollarization. However, this opinion article argues that the group stands at a crossroads, facing significant internal contradictions that challenge its coherence. While no longer just a diplomatic acronym, the diverging interests of members like India, Brazil, and South Africa undermine its potential to become a true alternative to the G7. The piece questions whether BRICS can overcome these fractures to evolve from a strategic partnership into a structured institution of global power.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has publicly released a directive aimed at strengthening the country's legal system to better counter foreign sanctions and what it terms as interference. The policy paper, first circulated internally in February, outlines plans to refine China's judicial toolkit for challenging trade and technology restrictions, such as those imposed by the United States. The directive calls for the establishment of an advanced system to understand and engage with foreign law. This move is part of a broader strategy to sharpen legal instruments to protect China's national interests on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Social media platform Reddit is introducing mandatory age verification for UK users to restrict access to mature content for those under 18. This change is in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, which requires platforms with adult material to implement robust age-checking measures. Reddit will use a third-party service, Persona, which will verify age using a government ID or a selfie, and promises to delete the data within seven days. While regulators support the move, civil liberties groups have raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for a surveillance-style internet experience for UK users.</p>

The president also reversed his previous skepticism of NATO, affirming his support for the alliance's common defense principle. The remarks signal a significant hardening of his administration's stance towards Moscow, stemming from Russia's continued aggression despite diplomatic conversations with the US leader.</p>

          <p>The UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 index has reached a new record, breaking the 9,000-point barrier for the first time in its history. Analysts suggest the London market has benefited from several factors in 2025, including investors diversifying away from US stocks amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies. The UK's established trade deal with the US and its concentration of reliable, long-established companies have made it an attractive, stable option in an uncertain global environment. Top-performing stocks include precious metals producer Fresnillo and defense contractors like Babcock and BAE Systems. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is increasing pressure on China's overall medical insurance system, which also includes a separate program for urban employees.

Pupils will be taught to recognize misogyny, understand the harms of AI-generated "deepfakes," and identify positive male role models. The updated guidance avoids strict age limits for topics, instead outlining what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school. The curriculum will also emphasize respectful relationships, consent, and online safety, with a focus on proactively engaging parents about what their children are being taught in these classes.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated NBA Summer League game, Bronny James delivered one of his strongest performances, scoring 17 points with five rebounds and five assists for the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite his impressive play, which drew significant attention from a crowd that included his father LeBron James, the Lakers fell to the rival Los Angeles Clippers 67-58. James showed growing confidence, particularly with his shooting, making three of his five three-point attempts. Clippers forward Jordan Miller was the star of the game, scoring 19 points and leading his team to victory in the final minutes.</p>

          <p>UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is set to deliver a crucial speech where she is expected to address the country's growing budget deficit and outline plans for economic growth. Investors are looking for signals on how the Treasury will manage public finances, with government debt nearing 100% of GDP. Key areas of focus include a potential overhaul of the pensions system and how the government will fund its commitments without raising taxes on working people. With the government's options limited, there is concern in the financial sector that Reeves may target them with increased levies to fill the fiscal hole. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The £650 million program will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000, with the goal of making zero-emission cars more affordable for families. The move is part of the government's plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. However, industry experts and drivers note that a significant expansion of the UK's public charging infrastructure is also crucial to spur widespread EV adoption.</p>

          <p>A major adult safeguarding investigation was launched after a CCTV system at Muckamore Abbey Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Northern Ireland, was mistakenly left recording for six months.

Despite the discovery nearly eight years ago, no trials have concluded, and families have not been permitted to view the footage.

This article details how Scheffler, once ranked outside the top 150 in putting, sought help from renowned English coach Phil Kenyon in late 2023. Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip but a key change was switching to a mallet-style putter, which improved his alignment. The transformation has been remarkable, turning Scheffler's one major weakness into a strength and solidifying his position as the world's best player.</p>
