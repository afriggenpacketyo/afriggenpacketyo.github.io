          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a report detailing the Maryland Transportation Authority's (MDTA) failure to conduct a crucial vulnerability assessment of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in March 2024.  The NTSB concluded that this oversight prevented the MDTA from proactively identifying and mitigating known structural risks, contributing to the bridge's collapse and the loss of six lives.  The report also issued urgent safety recommendations for other bridge owners nationwide.</p>
