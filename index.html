          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to receive the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, Germany, recognizing her role in maintaining European unity and resilience. The award ceremony will host hundreds of guests, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Von der Leyen's tenure has spanned challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and she previously served as Germany's defense minister under Angela Merkel. Despite accolades, her career has faced controversy, including scrutiny over text messages with Pfizer's CEO and questions about contract awards during her time as defense minister.</p>

          <p>Harvard Medical School has experienced the termination of at least 350 research grants due to the Trump administration's accusations of unchecked antisemitism and DEI practices at the university. This action has affected numerous faculty members and disrupted research on critical topics like tuberculosis, Alzheimer's, and cancer, with scientists expressing concern over the loss of potential breakthroughs. Researchers highlight that these grants are contracts supporting specific research projects, not gifts, and their cancellation could lead to a loss of scientific talent to other countries. While Harvard has taken steps to address concerns, the Trump administration's demands are viewed by some as excessive.</p>

He envisions the law as a model for other states and a counter to violence in schools, emphasizing the commandments' value even for non-believers.

          <p>Chinese students in the U.S. are facing uncertainty after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced potential visa revocations for those in critical fields or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The announcement has been criticized as a new version of the Chinese Exclusion Act, with China lodging a protest against the decision. Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, has offered to welcome students discriminated against by American policies, while some analysts suggest the move could benefit China by encouraging talented individuals to stay or return.

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, founder of the Gangster Disciples, amidst a spree of clemency actions. Hoover, who was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, still faces a 200-year state sentence for murder, limiting the impact of the commutation. While Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, authorities allege he continued to promote Gangster Disciples members from prison. The commutation sparked debate, with Hoover's lawyer celebrating his release from federal prison and others questioning his continued influence within the gang.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that while President Trump's approach to the Ukraine war has been flawed, his instincts about ending the conflict are not entirely wrong. They suggest that rather than withdrawing from cease-fire talks, Trump should increase pressure on both Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal. A potential agreement could involve Russia retaining control of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, while Ukraine receives security guarantees and closer integration with the European economy. The board believes this approach would demonstrate strength against Putin and push both countries toward a settlement.</p>

          <p>Ibram X. Kendi contends that the Trump administration's systematic attacks on Black history aim to bury America's past and future. Kendi draws parallels between these actions and the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false accusations fueled violence against Black Atlantans. He highlights the importance of preserving Black history to understand racial inequity and the contributions of Black Americans, and how anti-Black racist policy and violence has historically shaped the nation. Kendi suggests that Trump's efforts to erase Black history are a raid on the opportunity for all Americans to understand the enduring consequences of racism.</p>

While the move could bring financial benefits and increased TV coverage, there are worries that the American franchise model may not align with the identity, history, and tradition of European basketball.

Experts also worry about policy changes, such as the rollback of new USDA food-safety rules. Some state and local food-safety programs are at risk due to the budget cuts, which affects how they support local programs.

A video clip of a laughing Joshlin further intensified the emotions, with the search for the missing girl continuing. Joshlin's teacher described her as a quiet pupil who was very tidy, and the class listened to her favorite gospel song to remember her.

          <p>Recent actions by the Trump administration, including restrictions on semiconductor software sales and potential visa revocations for Chinese students, risk undermining the fragile trade truce between the U.S. and China. These measures have angered Chinese families and authorities, raising questions about the future of trade talks. While some argue that the crackdown on students could ultimately benefit China by encouraging talent to stay or return, the immediate impact is one of uncertainty and anxiety. The U.S. continues to put pressure on China with these actions.</p>

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson has filed a $500 million defamation lawsuit against four former housekeepers who accused him of sexual assault, claiming the allegations are fabricated and part of an "extortionate" lawsuit. The lawsuit states that the Robinsons treated the plaintiffs with kindness and generosity, and they did not abuse, harm, or take advantage of them. The women filed their lawsuit anonymously, alleging incidents dating back to 2006 and accusing Mr. Robinson of pressuring them into sex. Robinson's lawyers have also filed a motion to dismiss the women's lawsuit, arguing they should not have been granted anonymity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets responded favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. U.S. futures jumped, oil prices rose, and the U.S. dollar gained against the yen and euro. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not authorize the use of tariffs. The White House immediately appealed, but investors appeared encouraged after months of turmoil brought on by Trump's trade war. The ruling has injected a brief respite before the next thunderclap.</p>

          <p>English Premiership rugby is experiencing an "end of an era" with the retirement of several key players, including Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Ben Youngs, and Alex Goode.

The retirements reflect a shift in the sport, with younger players increasingly replacing veterans. Danny Care also noted the mid-season retirements of Joe Marler and Anthony Watson, further emphasizing the changing landscape of English rugby.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping is reaffirming his commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing in China, despite U.S. concerns about trade imbalances and state subsidies. Xi's plan involves achieving self-reliance in high-tech sectors, potentially putting China on a collision course with the Trump administration's demands in ongoing trade talks. While China's manufacturing sector contributed significantly to its GDP, its strategy has been criticized for distorting competition. The "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer, but it faces challenges and could worsen global trade tensions.</p>

The watchdog warns of a "simmering anger" due to an imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, with complaints including asbestos, electrical and fire safety issues, pest control, and leaks. There were 6,380 complaints investigated in the year to March 2025, up from 1,111 in the year to March 2020. The Ombudsman is calling for a "transformative overhaul" of the current system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a "national tenant body".</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek quietly released an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with OpenAI. The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade was released on AI model repository Hugging Face. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics. DeepSeek has become the poster child of how Chinese artificial intelligence is still developing despite U.S. attempts to restrict the country's access to chips and other technology.</p>
