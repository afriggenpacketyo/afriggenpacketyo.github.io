          <p>The article reports on the increasing tensions between the US and China in space, with Chinese satellites exhibiting unusual and complex maneuvers, sometimes coming dangerously close to US spacecraft. China has developed a comprehensive space defense system, excelling in anti-satellite technologies. This has led to calls from American air and space force leaders for the development of space weapons, highlighting the escalating rivalry in what Beijing considers a "war-fighting domain." The Pentagon and space observers are unsure of the intentions behind China's satellite maneuvers, but the situation raises concerns about potential future conflicts in space. The increasing complexity of these maneuvers suggests a growing sophistication in China's space capabilities.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group's shares experienced a significant drop following reports of a Justice Department criminal investigation into possible Medicare fraud, focusing on the company's Medicare Advantage business practices. The company denies any notification of the probe and defends the integrity of its Medicare Advantage program. This investigation follows a previous civil inquiry into whether the company inflated diagnoses to receive extra payments. The company has faced a series of setbacks, including a cyberattack and higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a substantial loss in market capitalization. The uncertainty has raised concerns about the company's stability and potential removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>

          <p>Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., revealed that cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data, potentially costing the company up to $400 million. Sensitive data, including names, addresses, masked bank account numbers, and government ID images, was compromised, but passwords and private keys remained secure. Coinbase detected the breach, terminated the involved employees, warned affected customers, and enhanced fraud monitoring protections. The company is cooperating with law enforcement and offering a $20 million reward for information leading to the arrest of the criminals, rather than paying the $20 million ransom demand. The breach occurs as Coinbase prepares to join the S&P 500 stock index.</p>

          <p>Bella Culley, an 18-year-old from Billingham, UK, faces a potentially lengthy pre-trial detention in Georgia after being arrested for allegedly importing large quantities of narcotics. Georgian police seized 12kg of marijuana and 2kg of hashish from her travel bag at Tbilisi International Airport. The prosecutor has requested an initial 55 days to gather evidence, which could be extended by up to seven months. Culley's lawyer states that police aim to determine the origin of the narcotics and whether she intended to distribute them, and the teen told the court she is pregnant. The British consular service is providing support to Culley's family.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article discusses the rise in popularity of 'Earlybirds Club,' a roving dance party catering to women who prefer to dance in the early evening and be home before traditional nightclubs even open. Founded by two Gen Xers in Chicago, the club provides a safe, judgment-free zone for women, trans, and nonbinary people to enjoy pop anthems from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. The gatherings provide a sense of community and liberation for attendees, many of whom are mothers or caregivers seeking a break from their daily routines. One of the founders, Susie Lee, is battling stage IV breast cancer, which motivates the crowd to dance harder and embrace the joy of the moment.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Donald Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship violates four Supreme Court precedents.

Justice Elena Kagan questioned how the Supreme Court could rule on the order's constitutionality if district court judges couldn't issue national injunctions. Trump defended the order, claiming birthright citizenship was not intended for vacationers, and the case highlights ongoing legal battles over Trump's executive orders.</p>

While he didn't directly mention President Donald Trump's tariffs, Powell has previously cautioned that tariffs could slow growth and boost inflation.

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after growing more than expected in the first three months of the year, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was "very encouraging," but shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was "a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks." The growth was helped by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but analysts warned the strong rate of growth was unlikely to continue due to US tariffs and increased employer taxes. The Bank of England lowered UK interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% and hinted more cuts could follow in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The UK is in discussions with other countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for failed asylum seekers, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The government is exploring sending asylum seekers abroad for processing after their claims have been rejected in the UK. The proposals are focused on countries in the western Balkans, but Albania has stated it is not part of the talks.

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from about half before the pandemic. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach, with the median sale price in the first quarter of 2025 nearing $420,000. The affordability gap is worst in cities with zoning restrictions that limit new construction.</p>
