          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the escalating rivalry between China and the United States. While Lian believes that full-scale financial sanctions are unlikely, he suggests that Washington may gradually target specific Chinese entities, potentially pushing China out of the US dollar system. Lian notes that sanctioning China within the Swift system could significantly damage the system itself, given China's position as a major trading nation.

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association, due to tariffs and tightened border policies.

However, global airfares have slightly decreased, and some see opportunities for other regions to benefit from the shift.
