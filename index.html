          <p>This article reflects on the state of the Black Lives Matter movement five years after George Floyd's murder, highlighting both progress and persistent challenges. While the initial protests sparked global awareness and some policy changes, such as bans on the knee-to-neck maneuver, many hoped-for reforms remain unfulfilled, particularly in the US. The Trump administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and the continued prevalence of police violence against Black people underscore the ongoing struggle for justice and equality. Despite these setbacks, some activists remain resilient, focusing on community survival and grassroots efforts for change.</p>

          <p>Kyiv was targeted by a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack, injuring at least 17 people and damaging buildings across the city. The attacks occurred as Ukraine and Russia are engaging in a prisoner swap, with 390 people already freed and up to 1000 inmates expected to be released. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for stronger sanctions against Russia, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would hand over a draft outlining conditions for a settlement agreement once the swap is complete.</p>
