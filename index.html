          <p>North Korea celebrated the 80th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party with a massive military parade in Pyongyang, displaying its extensive weapons arsenal. The event highlighted the strengthening ties between North Korea, China, and Russia, with high-level officials from both nations in attendance. This demonstration of unity suggests Kim Jong Un's regime is in its strongest strategic position in decades, bolstered by international support that mitigates the impact of UN sanctions. The parade serves as a symbol of Kim's consolidated power and Pyongyang's growing confidence on the world stage.</p>

          <p>In a direct response to similar measures from the United States, China's Ministry of Transport has announced it will impose phased fees on U.S.-affiliated ships starting next Tuesday. The fees will apply to vessels owned, operated, or flagged by American entities and will increase incrementally over the next four years, mirroring the structure of the U.S. tariffs. This reciprocal action marks a significant escalation in the ongoing trade dispute, directly impacting maritime commerce between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a property she purchased in Virginia. Prosecutors allege she misrepresented the property as a secondary residence to secure a more favorable mortgage, while actually using it as a rental investment. The indictment follows public calls from President Donald Trump for legal action against James, who previously led a successful civil fraud case against him. James has denied the charges, calling them a politically motivated "weaponisation of our justice system."</p>

          <p>The Nobel Committee has awarded the 2025 Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado for her persistent and non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights in Venezuela. The announcement came amid widespread calls from some circles for President Donald Trump to receive the award for his role in brokering a peace deal between Israel and Hamas. The article notes that while Trump received several nominations, the deadline had passed before the deal was finalized, making him potentially eligible for next year's prize instead. Machado's selection is seen as a significant international recognition of the pro-democracy movement in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is causing significant financial distress for federal workers, many of whom are either furloughed or working without pay. Employees have expressed deep anxiety over their ability to cover basic living expenses like rent and groceries, with some anticipating the need to take on debt if the shutdown persists. The article highlights the personal stories of several workers who feel they are being treated as political pawns in a congressional dispute. The White House has blamed Democrats for the stalemate, while workers emphasize the psychological toll and disruption to public services.</p>

          <p>At just 19 years old, Arjun Malaviya from Southern California has visited 118 countries, becoming one of the youngest people to achieve such a feat solo. He began his 13-month journey on his 17th birthday, self-funding the entire $22,500 trip through various jobs. Malaviya focused on connecting with local communities, from visiting remote villages in Oceania to conversing with a Taliban guard in Afghanistan. His travels, documented across five full passports, were driven by a desire to understand different cultures and demonstrate that people worldwide share more similarities than differences, aiming to inspire other young people to explore the world.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is preventing Social Security Administration employees from issuing benefit verification letters, a crucial document for many recipients. These letters are often required to apply for or recertify eligibility for housing aid, fuel assistance, and other essential services. While benefits are still being paid, the inability to obtain these letters in person or by phone disproportionately affects elderly individuals and people with disabilities who may struggle with online systems. Workers report being inundated with desperate calls from beneficiaries at risk of losing housing or other critical support due to this administrative disruption.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly increased the deployment of the National Guard to nearly a dozen cities run by Democratic mayors, citing the need to combat crime and protect federal facilities.

While the administration claims the deployments are necessary for public safety, critics and local officials contend that crime rates are declining and the moves are politically motivated.

          <p>India has announced it is reopening its embassy in Kabul, four years after shutting it down following the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The decision was revealed during a landmark visit to India by Afghanistan's Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi. This move signifies a major diplomatic shift, upgrading India's previous "Technical Mission" to a full embassy, even though New Delhi does not formally recognize the Taliban government. The development reflects India's commitment to regional stability and providing humanitarian aid, occurring as the Taliban's relationship with India's rival, Pakistan, deteriorates.</p>

          <p>The NFL's announcement that Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has triggered a significant backlash from conservative commentators and MAGA supporters. Critics have pointed to the artist's support for Kamala Harris, his criticism of federal agencies like ICE, and the fact that he performs primarily in Spanish. In response, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made threatening comments about ICE presence at the event. Despite the controversy, Bad Bunny's music has seen a surge in streams, and the move is seen by many as an effort by the NFL to increase its global audience.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle and would not be taken as verifiable fact by a reasonable listener. Drake had sued the record label, which represents both artists, for allowing the song's publication. The ruling marks a significant moment in what the judge called "the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history."</p>

While exemptions exist for some staff, the mandate applies to the thousands of employees moving into the building. The move comes amid a broader debate over workplace surveillance and corporate security, and it aligns with the bank's recent push for a full five-day return to the office.</p>

          <p>Former French finance minister Eric Lombard has declared that "free trade is over, it is dead," blaming the United States and China for its demise.

He urged the European Union to adopt a more protectionist and "nationalistic" trade policy to avoid being marginalized. Lombard's stark comments reflect a growing sentiment in Europe that the continent must take tougher measures to protect its economic interests in an increasingly competitive world.

          <p>A growing skepticism within China towards Western-centric versions of classical history has recently focused on ancient Egyptian artifacts. This trend, often fueled by online nationalist discourse, questions the authenticity of historical treasures and the scholarly frameworks that present them. An exhibition of Egyptian artifacts at the Shanghai Museum drew scrutiny from figures like Huang Heqing, a retired professor, who publicly doubted the age of items like a pair of grass sandals. This phenomenon highlights a broader cultural and intellectual current in China that seeks to challenge and deconstruct established Western historical accounts.</p>

The attacks are part of an escalated Russian campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure as colder weather approaches.
