          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the recent escalation of conflict between India and Pakistan, highlighting India's strategic setbacks despite military engagements. India's aspirations as a diplomatic and economic power are hindered by its ongoing conflict with Pakistan, which is perceived as a sponsor of terrorism. The risk of escalation is heightened by the deployment of advanced weaponry and the involvement of global powers like the United States and China. Religious nationalism and hardened views on both sides further complicate the resolution of disputes, making restraint more challenging for India. The article suggests India's leaders must find a way to coexist with Pakistan to progress as a global power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses Malcolm X's legacy as an icon of the Black civil rights movement, emphasizing his advocacy for self-confidence and resistance against oppression 'by any means necessary.' It details his early life marked by racism and violence, his disillusionment with American society, and his eventual embrace of the Nation of Islam. The article also covers his later pilgrimage to Mecca, which shifted his views on race and led him to seek alliances among oppressed people of color. It also details how his legacy has been used in hip-hop and in film to create a resurgence of Black identity as a political identity.</p>

          <p>Kenton Cool, a British mountain guide, has achieved a record-breaking 19th ascent of Mount Everest, marking the most climbs by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool first climbed Everest in 2004 and has climbed it almost every year since then. The article notes that hundreds of climbers and guides are currently on the mountain during the spring climbing season, hoping to reach the summit before the weather deteriorates. Only Nepali Sherpa guides have scaled the peak more times than Cool, with Kami Rita holding the overall record of 30 ascents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the University of Tokyo have developed an artificial intelligence tool that allows doctors to observe blood clotting activity in real-time, offering a non-invasive way to detect potentially deadly blood clots. The tool uses a high-powered microscope to monitor platelets, which play a crucial role in heart disease, and can distinguish between single platelets, clumps, and white blood cells. This technology could enable safer, more personalized treatments for heart disease patients, though it is not yet ready for widespread use, this article reports. This advancement could change the standard of care for patients with coronary heart disease.</p>

          <h2>Simple Brick Stacking Technique Could Reduce Air Pollution in Bangladesh</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that a simple change in how bricks are stacked in kilns could significantly reduce air pollution in Bangladesh, one of the most polluted countries on Earth. By stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to increase airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery, kilns can operate more efficiently and reduce fuel use by approximately 23 percent. This intervention not only improves air quality but also boosts profits for kiln owners and enhances worker conditions. The research team is now working with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training to more kilns.</p>

          <p>This article examines the challenges faced by small, religiously affiliated colleges in rural America, which are experiencing declining enrollment and financial difficulties. Many of these institutions serve low-income, first-generation students and provide a personal touch and religious values that larger universities may lack. To combat these challenges, some colleges are exploring mergers and partnerships to streamline administrations and offer a wider range of programs. The article also highlights efforts by religious organizations to address the threats and foster collaboration among these institutions.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that the approval rating for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low of 27.4 percent, reflecting public dissatisfaction amid the cost-of-living crisis. The survey also reveals that a majority of respondents believe a consumption tax cut or abolition is necessary, yet express concern about potential declines in social security services. Furthermore, a significant portion of the population does not expect favorable outcomes from Japan-U.S. tariff talks and feels the government's efforts to control rising rice prices are inadequate.</p>

The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power before drifting into the bridge. The incident caused temporary closure of the bridge for inspection, though authorities found no major structural damage. The ship, used for training, was en route to Iceland after departing from Manhattan's Pier 17. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay discusses the Trump family's various business dealings and ventures, suggesting that they are profiting from the former president's return to office. It points to instances like the Executive Branch club, cryptocurrency deals, and Jared Kushner's investments from foreign entities as examples of potential conflicts of interest. The author argues that while Trump's actions are egregious, they are part of a broader trend of American politicians benefiting from foreign influence, citing Hunter Biden and the Clinton Foundation as examples. The article calls for legislative measures to prevent such activities and ensure accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article contrasts the growing popularity of sleeper trains in Europe with the declining state of long-distance rail travel in the United States. While Europe is revitalizing its night train network to compete with short-haul flights, the U.S. is slashing funding for public infrastructure and struggling with outdated systems. The author argues that America's car-centric culture and preference for air travel have led to underinvestment in rail, while Europe's commitment to sustainable transportation has fostered a thriving train culture. The article advocates for revitalizing American railways to offer a more connected and environmentally friendly travel option.</p>

          <p>China is shifting its approach to funding infrastructure projects in Africa by encouraging the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs). This model involves Chinese companies receiving long-term operating rights in exchange for providing construction financing, moving away from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. The financing shift is evident in projects like Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway, where Chinese contractors gain exclusive rights to operate the infrastructure to recoup their investment.</p>

The plan aims to save California $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year. Critics argue the increases are due to a policy enacted in 2024.</p>
