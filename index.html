          <p>A newborn baby boy was found dead in Notting Hill, London, prompting the arrest of a woman suspected of concealing the birth, neglect, and infanticide.  The Metropolitan Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the baby's death, and a post-mortem is pending.  The arrest highlights the complexities of such cases and the police's focus on welfare alongside investigation.
