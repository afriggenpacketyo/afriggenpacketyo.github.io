          <p>Nvidia and AMD have entered an unusual agreement with the U.S. government to share 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China. In exchange, the companies will receive export licenses for specific chips, including Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308, which were previously restricted. Analysts describe the deal as a transactional approach by the Trump administration, effectively an "indirect tariff at source" for doing business in China. While creating some long-term uncertainty, investors have reacted positively, viewing 85% of potential revenue as preferable to zero access to the lucrative Chinese market.

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal case. Judge Paul Engelmayer sharply criticized the DOJ's rationale, calling its premise that the materials would reveal significant new information "demonstrably false." The judge stated the request seemed more aimed at public relations than genuine transparency, noting the grand jury only heard summary testimony from law enforcement agents, which is already public record. He concluded that the materials are not of significant historical interest and do not meet the legal exceptions for disclosure.</p>

The investment is part of the company's "Universal EV Program," which aims to produce more affordable electric vehicles to compete with international manufacturers. The first vehicle from this initiative will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch with a target starting price of $30,000.

          <p>Shares of enterprise AI firm C3 AI fell by over 20% following the announcement of disappointing preliminary first-quarter sales figures and a restructuring of its sales organization. The company expects revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million, a significant drop from the previous year's $87.2 million. CEO Thomas Siebel called the results "completely unacceptable," attributing the poor performance to the disruptive effects of the reorganization and his own ongoing health issues, which have prompted a search for his successor. The company anticipates a much wider operating loss compared to the same period last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's ambitious satellite internet initiative, Project Kuiper, is showing signs of becoming a significant future revenue stream for the tech giant, despite not yet being commercially launched. The project aims to compete with SpaceX's Starlink by providing broadband to hundreds of millions of households in underserved areas globally. Even before its commercial debut, Kuiper has secured enterprise and government contracts, and its development is seen as a way to onboard new customers to Amazon's Prime and AWS ecosystems. While requiring over $10 billion in upfront investment, analysts see parallels to the successful long-term growth of Amazon Web Services. (not investment advice)</p>

HYSAs are recommended for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer easy access to cash without penalties. Conversely, CDs are suggested for those who want to lock in a guaranteed higher interest rate for a set period, which is advantageous if rates are expected to fall. For individuals seeking a balance, some experts recommend a "CD ladder" strategy or splitting funds between both account types to combine liquidity with higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA shows a significant rise in the number of abortions in the U.S. since the repeal of Roe v. Wade, largely driven by medication abortions facilitated through telehealth. One provider, Aid Access, shipped nearly 120,000 packs of abortion pills in just over a year, with a substantial portion going to residents in states with abortion bans. The research, the first to examine provision at the county level, found that requests were higher in poorer counties and those farther from physical abortion clinics. This trend highlights the role of "shield laws" in states that protect providers who mail pills across state lines.</p>

New signings Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz had encouraging debuts, contributing to the team's attack, but the team appeared defensively open, a recurring theme in their pre-season games. The team is adapting to a new 4-2-3-1 formation, and the absence of key midfielders highlighted vulnerabilities in their aggressive man-to-man pressing system. While the new signings offer exciting possibilities, the analysis suggests Liverpool may face a period of adjustment and defensive uncertainty early in the campaign.</p>

          <p>Gary Grant, the founder of the UK's largest independent toy retailer, The Entertainer, is handing over 100% ownership of the business to his 1,900 employees. The company, which Grant started with his wife in 1981, will be transferred to an employee ownership trust. This structure ensures that staff will receive a share of the company's profits and have a say in how the business is run. Grant stated the decision was made to preserve the company's family-oriented values and legacy, which would have been at risk if sold to a different business, calling the move a "win-win for everybody."</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Texas are advancing a bill that would allow private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone involved in the manufacturing, mailing, or distribution of abortion-inducing drugs. The proposed "Women and Child Protection Act" would also permit wrongful death lawsuits if the medication harms a fetus or the mother. This legislation seeks to create a new legal battlefront against medication abortion and is designed to challenge "shield laws" in other states that protect doctors who prescribe the pills to patients in states with bans. The bill is part of an ongoing effort in Texas to further restrict abortion access.</p>

          <p>A new executive order signed by President Trump, titled "Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking," is causing alarm among scientists and research advocates. The order grants political appointees sweeping authority over federal research grants, allowing them to overrule recommendations from scientific experts and terminate funding based on political criteria. Critics warn this move threatens to politicize American science by replacing merit-based evaluation with ideological loyalty, citing language in the order that awards must "advance the President's policy priorities." This action is seen as the latest in a series of administration attacks on scientific freedom and research integrity.</p>

          <p>Several presidential candidates in Malawi have nominated women as their running mates for the upcoming election, prompting analysis of whether this signals a genuine shift toward gender inclusion. While civil society groups have long advocated for greater female representation, some experts note that these women are in subordinate roles and often with smaller parties. With women comprising 57% of registered voters, the move may be a strategic appeal to the electorate. However, observers question if it's a substantive change or a token gesture, as voters' primary concerns remain food shortages, the economy, and corruption.</p>

While the threat of such a high tariff caused initial shock, a key caveat has brought some relief: the tariff would not apply to companies that have already committed to or are in the process of building manufacturing facilities in the U.S. This exemption is seen as a strategic move to incentivize domestic production and has clarified, at least temporarily, the administration's approach. The policy has created both concern for foreign manufacturers and a clearer path for those investing in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
