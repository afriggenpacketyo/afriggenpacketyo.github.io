          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 622 people and injuring over 1,300. The quake hit Kunar and Nangarhar provinces near the border with Pakistan, destroying numerous villages due to its shallow depth. Rescue operations are underway with medical teams and international aid agencies, including the UN and the Afghan Red Crescent, providing emergency assistance to the affected areas. Afghanistan is prone to seismic activity due to its location near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk increased by 3% after new trial data was released for its weight management drug, Wegovy. The study indicated that Wegovy provides a significantly greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to rival drugs from Eli Lilly, such as Zepbound and Mounjaro. This development is crucial as the two companies compete for dominance in the lucrative weight loss drug market. The positive news also comes as Denmark had recently lowered its economic growth forecast, partly due to Novo's challenges in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa is actively exploring a potential deal to sign Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho. The 25-year-old has been out of favor at his current club and has spent the last 18 months on loan at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, neither of which made the move permanent. Sancho had previously rejected a move to the Italian club Roma, and there was also interest from Juventus. The article clarifies that any potential transfer for Sancho is separate from Manchester United's own interest in Aston Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez.</p>

The cloud unit's revenue grew by 26% year-on-year, an acceleration from the previous quarter, bolstered by significant growth in AI-related product revenue. Investor confidence was further boosted by reports that Alibaba is developing a new, advanced AI chip to enhance its capabilities in the competitive artificial intelligence sector.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce tighter regulations for family members of individuals who have been granted asylum in the United Kingdom. The new criteria will include more stringent English language requirements and proof of sufficient financial resources to support themselves. These reforms are part of a broader overhaul of what the government describes as a "broken" asylum system, which also aims to end the use of hotels for housing migrants. The Conservative opposition has criticized the proposed changes as a "tiny tweak" that fails to address the larger issues at the border.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever expansion of government-funded childcare support has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of subsidized care per week for children aged nine months to four. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the initiative as a "landmark moment" that will provide significant financial relief to families. However, the rollout faces challenges, as parents report long waiting lists and nurseries struggle with staff shortages that limit the number of available places. Providers also warn that government funding rates are insufficient, forcing them to charge extra for consumables to cover their operational costs.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's state-owned train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, ending the practice of charging higher prices during busy weekday rush hours.

The move, championed by the Scottish Greens, aims to encourage more people to switch from cars to trains, making rail travel more affordable and flexible. The decision follows a previous pilot scheme and was confirmed by First Minister John Swinney as part of the government's agenda.</p>

According to the book, "Power and the Palace," the incident occurred on a train, and she successfully fought off her attacker using the heel of her shoe. The Queen has since become a prominent advocate for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, though she has not publicly discussed her own experience to keep the focus on the survivors she supports.

The discovery suggests that the region has the natural conditions suitable for cultivating salt-tolerant organisms. Researchers will now conduct laboratory studies to determine if it is a new species and explore its potential for commercial aquaculture development in the area.</p>

Five suspected members of the ring were arrested last week—two in Greece and three in Germany—with police stating that the gang's profits are estimated to exceed 5 million euros. The smugglers concealed the drugs in trucks, often registered in Bulgaria, that were transporting other goods internationally. The investigation, which led to the confiscation of over 300 kg of cocaine, was initiated based on a tip from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>

The author posits that figures like Nigel Farage, despite achieving goals such as ending free movement, now focus on new immigration-related crises, demonstrating that no measure is ever considered sufficient. The piece draws parallels to escalating crackdowns in the U.S., suggesting that the narrative of an "invasion" leads to ever-widening enforcement that can eventually affect legal residents and citizens.

The investigation also uncovered that the company's sales figures were grossly inflated in official accounts, and customers were sold lower-quality diamonds than they had paid for.</p>

          <p>Following discussions with leaders from China and India at the SCO summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that a sustainable peace in Ukraine requires addressing the issue of NATO's eastward expansion. Putin reiterated his position that the conflict's root causes must be eliminated, which includes restoring what he terms a "fair balance in the security sphere." He also referenced recent "understandings" reached with U.S. President Donald Trump during a summit in Alaska, expressing hope that these talks, along with efforts from China and India, could contribute to a resolution. Putin framed the war as a response to Western attempts to pull Ukraine into its orbit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD saw its Hong Kong-listed shares fall by nearly 8% after reporting a 30% drop in its second-quarter net profit. The decline is attributed to an aggressive price war within China's domestic EV market, which has negatively impacted the industry's profitability. Despite the profit slump, BYD's revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, largely due to an expansion in overseas sales. The company acknowledged in its earnings report that increased price competition and excessive marketing in China had an adverse effect, as retail car prices have fallen significantly over the past two years.

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in August, reaching its fastest pace in five months. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered 50.5, surpassing economists' expectations and moving back into growth territory. This positive reading was driven by a recovery in new orders and export business, suggesting some resilience in external demand despite ongoing trade tensions. However, the result contrasts with the official government survey, which indicated a fifth consecutive month of contraction, highlighting persistent weak domestic demand and creating a mixed picture of the country's economic health.

          <p>A U.S. district court judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was sought by immigrant advocacy groups who argued the children would face abuse and persecution upon their return. The administration contended that the flights were for "repatriation" to reunite the children with their families, a claim disputed by the advocates. The judge expanded the 14-day order to cover all unaccompanied children at risk of deportation while the case is reviewed, citing potential violations of federal laws designed to protect them.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin is seen as a significant step in normalizing relations between the two Asian powers. This diplomatic engagement comes as India faces economic pressure from the U.S., including tariffs on its imports, prompting Delhi to pursue a policy of "strategic autonomy." While the talks promise to ease visa processes and resume direct flights, major challenges remain, including a massive trade deficit and unresolved border disputes. The renewed dialogue will test India's ability to balance its relationships within geopolitical forums like the Quad, which are often viewed as a counter to China's influence.</p>

During the confrontation, cameras captured Suárez spitting on Gene Ramirez, the Sounders' director of security. This incident adds to Suárez's long history of controversial on-field behavior and could result in a multi-game suspension from Major League Soccer, which has previously disciplined players for similar actions.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott stated he "wasn't surprised" by the team's decision to trade All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. While Prescott didn't expect a trade initially, he noted that the contract negotiations between Parsons and the Cowboys' front office seemed to become personal, making the outcome less shocking. The trade, which sent Parsons to Green Bay in exchange for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark, followed Parsons' trade request. Parsons subsequently signed a record-breaking four-year, $188 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.</p>

The California Highway Patrol is expected to take over protection for Harris, whose federal detail was terminated just days before she is set to begin a nationwide book tour. Trump's move ended the 18-month protection extension granted by the previous administration, citing threats against the former VP. Governor Newsom's office criticized the decision as being driven by "erratic, vindictive political impulses," positioning the state's action as a countermeasure against the president's move.</p>

She claimed the edit was an attempt to "whitewash" his alleged crimes.

          <p>Manufacturing activity across several key Asian economies, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, contracted in August, largely due to the impact of U.S. tariffs. Private surveys indicate that the trade dispute is taking a toll on the region's export-dependent nations, overshadowing a surprisingly positive manufacturing report from a private survey in China. Analysts express concern that the trend of frontloading shipments to the U.S. to avoid higher levies is unsustainable, and that manufacturers will face weakening profits in the coming months. The data reinforces the fragile state of the region's economic recovery and maintains pressure on policymakers to provide support. (not investment advice)</p>
