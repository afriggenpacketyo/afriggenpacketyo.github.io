          <p>The U.S. and China have announced an agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, aiming to foster a sustainable and mutually beneficial economic relationship. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced that both sides will reduce their tariffs by 115%, bringing them down to 10%. During this pause, the effective tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. will be 30%, while China's effective tariffs will be at 10%. The two sides will establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations, potentially alternating between China and the United States for these talks.</p>

          <p>Two West Virginia anglers, Jason Floyd and John Plott, broke separate state fishing records on the same day, April 22. Floyd caught a 24.57-inch, 5.75-pound redhorse sucker at the Belleville Lock and Dam on the Ohio River, using a swimbait and jighead. Later that day, Plott caught a 12.44-inch, 1.60-pound redear sunfish at Plum Orchard Lake in Fayette County, using a nightcrawler. This marks Plott's second record-breaking catch of the species, though his previous weight record still stands, and is the first time the redhorse sucker state record has been broken since the agency added the fish to its record categories in 2024.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese analysts and politicians are cautioning that Pakistan's use of mainland Chinese weapons against India serves as a wake-up call for Taiwan's military. The clash, in which Pakistan reportedly brought down several Indian jets using Chinese-supplied aircraft, sensors, and missiles, demonstrates Beijing's maturing system-centric warfare doctrine. According to Taiwanese lawmaker Chen Kuan-ting, Pakistan's extensive use of Chinese weapons systems, including J-10C aircraft and PL-15E long-range missiles, enabled it to successfully down India's latest 4.5-generation Rafale fighters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating the state's efforts to eradicate homeless encampments by urging cities and counties to effectively ban tent camps on public property. Newsom has created a model ordinance for municipalities to adopt, outlawing encampments on sidewalks, bike paths, and parklands. While he cannot force cities to comply, the initiative coincides with the release of over $3 billion in state-controlled housing funds that local officials can use to implement the ban. The model ordinance does not specify criminal penalties, but it makes encampments on public property a crime, leaving penalty decisions to individual cities.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) is challenging the amended Employment Equity Act in court, arguing that it is unconstitutional and economically harmful. The act imposes strict hiring targets for non-white employees, requiring companies with over 50 employees to meet sectoral targets for the number of Black people, women, and disabled people in skilled and senior roles. While supporters see it as essential for transformation, the DA argues that the act violates anti-discrimination clauses and gives the state too much regulatory power. The Pretoria High Court has reserved judgment after hearing the case.</p>

The sale of access to Trump through the cryptocurrency has drawn bipartisan criticism and triggered a suspicious trading pattern. Crypto investors have raced to expand their holdings of $TRUMP to win a private dinner with him and a tour of the White House, driving up the memecoin's price and generating fees for the Trump family and business partners. The aggressive effort to promote the dinner has provoked a backlash, derailing crypto legislation and raising concerns about corrupt influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to revive a controversial "most favored nation" policy aimed at slashing drug costs by tying the amount the government pays for some medicines to lower prices abroad. The executive order directs the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to crack down on unreasonable policies in foreign countries that suppress drug prices. It also directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage most favored nation prices, potentially cutting drug prices by 59%.

Bessent emphasized that the U.S. seeks decoupling for strategic necessities, such as critical medicines and semiconductors, which were highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. While a generalized decoupling from China is not the goal, the agreement represents a 90-day pause with reciprocal duties halted, though a 10% tariff and a 20% charge related to fentanyl will remain.

          <p>Celebrity musicians, including Elton John and Dua Lipa, are urging the U.K. government to reconsider proposed copyright law reforms that would allow AI developers access to rights-protected content. The musicians argue that the proposals, which require artists to opt out of having their copyrighted works scraped by large language models, would amount to giving away their valuable work. They are calling for an amendment that would require AI labs to disclose which works they have used and allow for licensing regimes.</p>

The intensity of the blaze forced residents to jump from windows, and the first firefighters to arrive were overwhelmed by the flames. The four-story building, constructed in 1968, lacked a sprinkler system, which the fire chief believes could have contained the fire. Ladder trucks were used to rescue residents, and firefighters crawled on their hands and knees to evacuate others.</p>
