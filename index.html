            <p>A CBS News report delves into the 2017 murder of Aaron Friar in Medford, Oregon, focusing on the potential involvement of his 15-year-old daughter, Ellie. The investigation uncovers a complex web of relationships, abuse allegations, and conflicting testimonies involving Ellie, her boyfriend Gavin MacFarlane, and their friend Russell Jones. Ultimately, MacFarlane confessed to the murder, claiming he acted on instinct after weeks of planning, but investigators suspect Ellie was the mastermind, driven by alleged abuse and a desire to be with MacFarlane. The case raises questions about manipulation, abuse, and the extent of each individual's responsibility in the crime, leaving lingering doubts about the true motives behind the tragic event.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary Easter truce in Ukraine from Saturday evening until midnight Sunday, citing humanitarian grounds. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded cautiously, stating that if Russia genuinely commits to a full ceasefire, Ukraine will reciprocate defensively and proposes extending it past Easter. The announcement follows previous failed ceasefire attempts and comes amid frustrations from the Trump administration regarding the slow pace of peace talks between the two countries. Simultaneously, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange, mediated by the UAE, marking the largest exchange since the conflict began.</p>

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to open in 750 schools across England, providing half an hour of free childcare before school for primary-aged children. The initiative, part of a Labour campaign promise, aims to support parents and break down barriers to opportunity. However, teaching unions have raised concerns that the government funding allocated for the scheme may be insufficient to cover the costs. The National Association of Head Teachers has called for careful consideration of funding levels before a national rollout to avoid impacting other school provisions.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk is establishing a corporate campus in rural Texas, housing headquarters for X, The Boring Company, and a SpaceX facility. This move reflects a broader trend of tech companies relocating from Silicon Valley, attracted by lower costs and favorable regulations. Local residents have mixed feelings about the development, appreciating the job opportunities but also concerned about the potential for urbanization and environmental impact. The area is experiencing rapid growth and development, with both benefits and challenges for the local community.</p>
