          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years and exceeding economists' expectations. This increase in inflation strengthens the argument for the Bank of Japan to consider exiting its decade-long ultra-easy monetary policy. Headline inflation also remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated a readiness to continue raising rates at a gradual pace, while also assessing the potential impacts of U.S. tariffs. The CNBC article notes this is a developing story.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist detained in Louisiana, testified during an asylum hearing that deportation could lead to assassination, kidnapping, or torture. He stated that the U.S. government has wrongly labeled him a terrorist sympathizer. Witnesses called by his lawyers argued that his international prominence makes him a target for Israel if deported. Despite these arguments, Judge Comans denied a motion to end his immigration proceedings. The New York Times article highlights the personal and geopolitical elements of Khalil's case, as the Trump administration argues his presence hinders American foreign policy against antisemitism.

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem is expected to announce a fall in domestic gas and electricity prices for millions of households from July, marking the first drop in a year. Analysts forecast a decrease of over £100 in the annual bill for a typical home. The BBC article notes that while the price drop is welcome, many people still struggle to pay their energy bills. Customer debt to suppliers remains high. Charities emphasize that a slight price decrease won't fix the underlying issues of energy poverty.</p>

          <p>Black South Africans have responded with a mix of anger, disbelief, and humor to President Trump's false claims about white farmers facing genocide in South Africa. After living through decades of apartheid, they find it infuriating that the Trump administration casts Afrikaners as victims. The New York Times article highlights that the jokes mask deep-seated anger over the legacy of apartheid and the inequality that many Black people say continues to define life in their country.
