          <p>President Trump stated he was unsure if everyone in the U.S. is entitled to due process, a constitutional right, and whether he has to uphold the Constitution as president. He deferred to his lawyers and the Supreme Court's guidance, while addressing the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deported El Salvadoran man. Trump indicated the Justice Department has a different interpretation of the court's decision regarding Abrego Garcia's return, and that El Salvador's president would decide on his return. Trump also mentioned Abrego Garcia's alleged MS-13 involvement and domestic violence allegations. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 100% tariff on movies made in foreign countries, citing a "National Security threat" and a concerted effort by other nations to attract filmmakers with incentives. He argues that the U.S. movie industry is dying and that these tariffs will bring film production back to America. This move follows previous tariffs imposed by Trump on other countries, including China, which has already reduced the quota of American films allowed into the country. The U.S. remains a major film production hub, but has seen a decrease in production spending compared to countries like Australia and the UK.</p>

          <p>Australian stocks experienced a decline following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years.

This movement occurred amidst global trade uncertainty and holidays in several Asian markets. Oil prices also plunged after OPEC+ agreed to raise production, and U.S. futures edged down after strong gains on Wall Street the previous week.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the reopening and expansion of Alcatraz prison to house America's most violent offenders, citing the need for law, order, and justice. The prison, which closed in 1963, would serve as a symbol of these principles. This announcement follows Trump's policy of sending alleged gang members to prisons in El Salvador and discussions about sending "homegrown criminals" to foreign prisons. Alcatraz, originally a naval defense fort, was later a military prison before becoming a federal penitentiary housing notorious criminals.</p>

          <p>The finance chiefs of ASEAN, plus Japan, China, and South Korea, have issued a warning regarding the potential global economic fallout from protectionist trade policies, following the U.S. President's announcement of higher import tariffs.

Trump's tariffs, including sector-based levies and "reciprocal" tariffs, are expected to heavily impact export-reliant Asian economies.

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to preserve fertility, experts like Vardit Ravitsky caution against over-reliance, citing high costs and no guarantees. Ravitsky fears women see egg freezing as a guaranteed solution, not a gamble with multiple risks, including medical complications and financial burdens. While some companies offer it as a benefit, critics argue it's to retain female employees rather than help them. Fertility specialist Dr. Marcelle Cedars worries about the emphasis on profits in private equity-backed fertility companies, potentially creating warped incentives.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 4% after OPEC+ agreed to surge production for a second month, adding 411,000 barrels per day in June. This decision follows a similar production increase in May. The move has raised concerns about an oversupplied market, especially amid fears of a recession due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Oil prices have fallen more than 20% this year, impacting oilfield service firms and major oil companies.</p>
