          <p>Thai and Cambodian soldiers engaged in a firefight at a contested border area, with both nations accusing the other of initiating the conflict. The clash occurred near the ancient Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple, a site of recent high tensions. This event follows a rapid deterioration in diplomatic relations, including ambassador expulsions and border closures, sparked by recent land mine incidents that injured Thai soldiers. The long-standing territorial disputes, particularly over the Preah Vihear temple, continue to fuel nationalist sentiments and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, states are increasingly intervening to compel local municipalities to approve more affordable housing projects, countering resistance from "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) activists. The article highlights Utah, where soaring home prices have made homeownership unattainable for most renters, prompting the state to enforce denser housing mandates. This trend, seen in both red and blue states, aims to address a nationwide housing shortage that is pricing out middle-class families and hindering wealth creation for younger generations. However, these top-down measures face significant local pushback over concerns about infrastructure strain and loss of community character.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have launched their first joint oceanographic expedition in five years, signaling renewed scientific cooperation with a focus on climate change and potential Arctic ambitions. A team of 25 scientists set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day mission to study the deep-sea environments of the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The research aims to understand the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems over the last 126,000 years. This collaboration marks a significant step in their bilateral marine research, framed by officials as a shared commitment to addressing global environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game provided entertainment with a 3-1 victory over the Liga MX All-Stars, but the event's significance is being questioned, particularly after star player Lionel Messi's decision to skip it. While the game showcases league talent, Messi's absence highlights a potential cultural disconnect and raises questions about the demands placed on international stars. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to re-evaluate the All-Star format to maintain player interest and boost viewership. The situation has initiated a broader conversation about whether the mid-season spectacle remains relevant or requires a fundamental change.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a major settlement with the federal government, paying $200 million to resolve investigations into alleged anti-discrimination law violations and an additional $21 million to the EEOC. The deal follows the Trump administration's accusations that the university failed to curb antisemitism on campus, which led to the withholding of $400 million in federal research grants. As part of the agreement, this funding will be restored, and Columbia will implement reforms including a ban on masked protests and enhanced campus security. The university maintains it does not admit wrongdoing but acknowledges that reforms were necessary.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed that the Trump administration's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision, stating that the proposed interpretation denying citizenship to many individuals born in the United States violates the Constitution. This ruling represents another significant legal obstacle for the administration's policy, which has faced multiple injunctions since its inception. The case reinforces the legal precedent of the 14th Amendment, which has historically granted citizenship to nearly everyone born on U.S. soil, and moves the issue closer to a potential Supreme Court showdown.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual move, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, marking a direct escalation of his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This visit is the first of its kind in nearly two decades and challenges the long-standing tradition of respecting the central bank's political independence. The president has been openly critical of Powell's refusal to lower interest rates, and this in-person meeting is a powerful symbolic gesture. The move brings his public critiques directly to the Federal Reserve's headquarters, intensifying the conflict over the nation's monetary policy.</p>

Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research suggests this more attainable target could be more effective for public health than the widely-known but less evidence-based 10,000-step goal. The 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign, not scientific research.

          <p>An Australian federal court has ruled that five women can proceed with their lawsuit against Qatar Airways over invasive searches conducted at Doha's airport in 2020. The women were among a group ordered off a flight and subjected to physical examinations after a baby was found abandoned in a terminal restroom. A lower court had previously dismissed the case, arguing the airline was protected by international travel laws and could not have prevented the actions of Qatari police.

          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has canceled thousands of water tests intended to detect harmful pollutants in rivers and lakes over the last three months due to severe staff shortages.

Seven national testing programs have been completely paused, affecting monitoring in critical areas like the polluted River Wye.

These snails typically inhabit warmer subtropical and tropical waters, staying afloat on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft. Researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, who had not seen the species locally in a decade, speculate that its appearance may be linked to warmer offshore waters moving toward the coast.

Formed in working-class Birmingham, the band reacted against the optimistic music of the late 1960s by creating a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, produced the detuned, powerful riffs that became the genre's foundation. Combined with Osbourne's distinctive wail and lyrics exploring dark themes, Black Sabbath created a revolutionary sound that has influenced countless rock bands for over five decades.</p>

          <p>USC's star basketball freshman, Alijah Arenas, is expected to be sidelined for at least six to eight months after suffering a serious knee injury requiring surgery. An MRI revealed a slight meniscus tear and a bone bruise, dealing a major setback to the highly touted player and the Trojans' upcoming season. Arenas, a five-star recruit who graduated high school a year early to join USC, was anticipated to play a crucial role for the team. Given his status as a top NBA draft prospect, the long recovery timeline raises questions about his future with the program.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has initiated a ballot measure to repeal the city's gross receipts tax, a move they argue would improve the local business climate but would also eliminate $800 million in annual city revenue. Proponents claim the tax, which is levied on revenue rather than profit, stifles job growth and makes the city unaffordable. City officials, however, have raised alarms, warning that such a drastic revenue cut would be an "assault on public safety" and could force a 50% reduction in police or fire department staffing. The proposal escalates an ongoing battle between business and labor groups over the city's economic policies.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of this growth. They warn that the externally facing economy could struggle if global trade softens under the threat of new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence by reducing regulation and promoting American technology exports. One controversial order targets what the White House calls "woke Marxist lunacy," requiring federally funded AI companies to maintain politically neutral models free from ideological biases like DEI. Another order seeks to fast-track the construction of energy-intensive data centers by easing environmental permitting laws. The administration's "AI Action Plan" frames the initiative as a geopolitical race against China, while critics argue it prioritizes corporate interests and ideology over public safety.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, imposing a 19% tariff on imports from both nations while ensuring American exports face no duties. Analysts suggest this move is an indirect strategy to reshape regional supply chains and contain China's economic influence, particularly by tapping into Southeast Asia's rare earth mineral reserves. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is debated, as many Chinese companies have already shifted production to these countries over the past five years. This proactive localization may blunt the impact of U.S. efforts to reconfigure regional trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months into the Trump administration's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since 2014. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations in the first half of the year, projecting an annual total over 300,000. This significant increase reflects the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, including expanded funding and a broader mandate for enforcement.
