        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed the first human case of New World Screwworm infestation in the U.S., identified in a patient who recently returned from El Salvador. This parasitic condition, caused by fly larvae that feed on live tissue, is usually found in South America and the Caribbean. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated the risk to U.S. public health is currently very low, the case prompted an investigation with Maryland's health department. Texas officials previously issued advisories as the screwworm moved north, and the U.S. government has initiated policies, including building an insect dispersal facility, to prevent its spread in animal imports. There is no medication to treat this painful and potentially deadly condition, underscoring the importance of monitoring for clinical signs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the firing of Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a significant move following months of public attacks against the central bank. Trump accused Cook of making false statements on mortgage documents, labeling her actions as "gross negligence" and "potentially criminal." This action challenges the established federal law, which states that Fed board members serve 14-year terms and can only be removed "for cause." Cook had previously resisted calls to resign, emphasizing her intent not to be intimidated. The president's decision sets an early test for his power to dismiss Fed members and raises questions about the institution's independence and stability.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, identified by his birth name Montero Lamar Hill, has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting arrest. The charges follow his arrest last week in Studio City, Los Angeles, where police responded to him in the middle of a boulevard and he allegedly charged at officers. Following his arrest, Hill was taken to a local hospital for a possible overdose. A judge later reduced his bail from $300,000 to $75,000, citing his lack of prior convictions and low flight risk. His father expressed remorse for the incident, stating that his son is doing well and will receive the help he needs.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United experienced a dramatic 3-2 defeat against Liverpool, conceding a 100th-minute winner after fighting back from a two-goal deficit and playing with ten men due to a red card and multiple injuries. The match was overshadowed by the ongoing transfer saga of striker Alexander Isak, who remains absent from team training, intensifying calls for a resolution before the transfer window closes. Despite the loss, fans applauded the team's spirit, reflecting a deep connection between the players and the club. This intense fixture, marked by high emotions and crowd hostility towards Liverpool, highlighted Newcastle's offensive struggles and defensive vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that 600,000 Chinese students will be allowed to study at U.S. colleges, signaling a potential easing of U.S.-China relations amidst ongoing trade negotiations. This statement comes after earlier tariffs and visa restrictions, and a previous plan by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revoke visas for Chinese nationals tied to the Communist Party. Trump emphasized the importance of the student exchange and expressed optimism about improving relations with China, despite recent trade tensions and threats of further tariffs on Chinese goods like magnets. The move marks a notable shift in tone from the administration's earlier stance.</p>

          <p>During talks with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, President Donald Trump expressed a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un again, possibly this year, and praised their relationship. Trump also controversially suggested the U.S. could seek ownership of land for its military base in South Korea, an idea likely to provoke strong reactions. The meeting followed Trump's critical social media post about South Korea's internal affairs, which he later downplayed as a "misunderstanding." Despite a recent trade deal, the two nations continue to negotiate over military spending and nuclear energy, highlighting ongoing complexities in the alliance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and other Southern California airports experienced ground stops due to potential thunderstorms. The Federal Aviation Administration temporarily grounded departures from several nearby states, including Phoenix, Denver, and Salt Lake City, as a precautionary measure. These storms are part of a surge of monsoonal moisture and instability across the Western U.S., which has also brought dry lightning, dust storms, and rare summer rain. While the ground stops for Long Beach and John Wayne airports expired, the broader weather pattern continues to impact travel and has caused other significant weather events across the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at ending cashless bail in Washington, D.C., and other localities by threatening to withhold federal funding, as part of a broader federal crackdown on crime. He also directed the Justice Department to investigate instances of flag burning, despite a Supreme Court ruling protecting it as symbolic speech. Trump stated his desire for a minimum one-year prison sentence for flag burning and encouraged federal law enforcement to hire more personnel for civil disturbance response. The orders also mandate the creation of a specialized D.C. National Guard unit and a quick reaction force for nationwide deployment, sparking debate over federal intervention and constitutional rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food price inflation in the UK has reached 4.2% this month, its highest level in 18 months, primarily driven by the increasing costs of chocolate, butter, and eggs. The British Retail Consortium's latest monitor indicates that high demand, tightening supply, and increased labor costs contribute to these rises, with poor cocoa harvests also impacting chocolate prices. This figure aligns with separate data from the Office for National Statistics, showing similar increases in everyday food items. While some relief is noted for parents with cheaper clothing and stationery, consumers are urged to reassess household budgets amidst rising bills.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC study reveals that UK councils are grappling with spiraling debt, totaling £122 billion, forcing them to sell off public assets like schools, care homes, and sports clubs. This "fire sale" is a consequence of increased borrowing, often through the Public Works Loans Board, and insufficient central government funding. Many councils are now granted "capitalisation directions" to sell assets for day-to-day services, a practice criticized as unsustainable and eroding public value. The situation highlights a "broken" funding system, with a third of councils fearing bankruptcy within five years without long-term government solutions, despite recent reforms and increased grants.</p>

Despite winning that point and the next two sets, he ultimately lost the match in the fifth set and smashed his racket in frustration.

          <p>The federal government has appealed a judge's ruling that Alina Habba unlawfully served as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, sending the case to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Habba, a Trump appointee, publicly criticized New Jersey senators for blocking her nomination, attributing their opposition to her arrest of a congresswoman. The district judge had ruled Habba's actions since July 1, 2025, could be voided, citing her lack of lawful authority after her interim appointment expired.

Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias noted a violation of a state law prohibiting sharing license plate data for immigration or out-of-state abortion investigations.

Trump's policies, including tariffs, have inadvertently fostered closer economic ties between China, India, and Russia, potentially leading to a broader strategic realignment. This shift could gradually diminish American influence in the region, as trade between these Asian powers strengthens.
