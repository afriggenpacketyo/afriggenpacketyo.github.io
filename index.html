Roberts's defense of judicial independence comes amid intense pressure on the Supreme Court and scrutiny of federal judges overseeing cases challenging the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>New York City Police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia University after they occupied Butler Library, resulting in injuries to at least two public safety officers. Protesters flooded the library, vandalized property, and refused to show identification, leading to the university requesting NYPD assistance.

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is facing a lawsuit from investors alleging that the company misled them by withholding information on how the backlash following the death of former CEO Brian Thompson impacted the company. The lawsuit claims that the company's statements on performance expectations were 'materially false and misleading' and that it failed to inform shareholders that it would have to adjust its strategy. The lawsuit also states that Thompson's death triggered public outrage over health insurance costs and claims denials. The suit seeks unspecified damages for UnitedHealth investors.</p>
