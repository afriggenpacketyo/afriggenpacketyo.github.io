          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that he expects to meet with Chinese officials again within the next few weeks to continue trade negotiations, aiming for a more comprehensive agreement. This follows a 90-day pause on tariffs previously imposed by both countries, with both sides lowering their baseline tariff rate. Bessent also highlighted progress on discussions regarding fentanyl, suggesting China is serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs. This development has led to a rally in global stock markets, with the S&P 500 rising significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook after the U.S. and China agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. Trump claimed that Cook intends to increase Apple's investments in the United States, potentially reaching $500 billion and building more plants. Apple had previously announced plans to spend $500 billion to expand its U.S. operations, including assembling artificial intelligence servers in Houston. The cooling of U.S.-China trade tensions is expected to benefit Apple, which conducts a significant portion of its device production in China and relies on the region for sales.</p>

While gold prices have dipped slightly, they remain near record highs, prompting investors to consider cashing out. The potential for substantial profit is a significant advantage, particularly for those who bought gold before 2025. However, selling gold means losing a valuable portfolio diversifier and a hedge against inflation, which could be crucial in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing for a statewide ban on homeless encampments, calling on cities and counties to outlaw tent camps on public property. Newsom's administration has allocated billions to address homelessness, but this move signals a tougher stance on the issue. The governor has created a model ordinance for municipalities to adopt, but cities will decide the penalties for violations. While the ordinance does not specify criminal penalties, it does make encampments on public property a crime by definition, and frustration with homelessness has been rising among Californians.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a deal to provide hundreds of thousands of U.S.-designed artificial intelligence chips to G42, an Emirati A.I. firm previously scrutinized for ties to China. This potential agreement marks a shift in U.S. tech policy, diverging from the previous administration's caution regarding A.I. chip sales to countries with close ties to China. The negotiations, led by White House A.I. czar David Sacks, have sparked internal tensions due to national security concerns about potential misuse of the technology by the Emiratis, with experts warning about the risks of handing control of A.I. to countries with untrustworthy political systems.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is advancing a plan to lower U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, a policy he calls the "most favored nation" approach.

Experts express doubts about the policy's effectiveness, questioning whether other nations and drugmakers will comply. While some support the idea of lowering prices, concerns remain about the feasibility and potential impact on drugmakers' profits and research capabilities.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio revealed that an unidentified Trump administration official had been the subject of a State Department "disinformation" dossier compiled by the Global Engagement Center (GEC) during the Biden administration. The dossier allegedly contained social media posts identifying the official as a "purveyor of disinformation." Rubio has announced the closure of the GEC, criticizing it for silencing American voices. The identity of the targeted official remains undisclosed, and the State Department has directed inquiries back to Rubio's initial revelation.</p>

His release was portrayed by Hamas officials as an attempt to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war. The release has stirred mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a positive step and others expressing frustration over the exclusive treatment of an American citizen.</p>

          <p>This article examines the changing public sentiment towards immigration enforcement in the U.S., noting that support for aggressive measures tends to erode when attention shifts from the border to domestic communities. While Trump initially benefited from a hawkish stance on immigration, recent polls indicate a decline in his approval rating on the issue. The article argues that the administration's mass-deportation campaign may be overreaching, and that a more selective approach focusing on national security threats and violent criminals could be more politically sustainable. The impact of media coverage on shaping public opinion is also discussed.</p>
