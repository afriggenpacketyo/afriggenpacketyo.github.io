        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union starting June 1, citing stalled trade negotiations and unfair trade practices. He also threatened a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in the United States, putting pressure on Apple to shift production. The announcements have rattled markets, with US and European stocks falling, and have drawn criticism from trade experts who believe Trump is using the threats to gain leverage in trade talks. The EU has not commented on the latest threat, but is expected to push back and retaliate with its own tariffs on US products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that credit card interest rates are unlikely to decrease significantly in the near future, potentially remaining elevated well into 2026. The Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts, coupled with factors like delinquency rates and lender margins, contribute to this outlook. The average credit card interest rate in the U.S. currently stands at 21.37%, and credit card debt per household rose 3.5% in the third quarter of 2024, reaching $6,730 on average. While waiting for rates to drop, consumers are advised to explore debt repayment strategies and consider options like hardship rate reductions or balance transfer cards. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House Republican tax bill aims to repeal subsidies that incentivize electric vehicle (EV) purchases and manufacturing in the United States. If enacted, the bill would eliminate tax credits for battery production, EV purchases, and charging stations, while imposing a new annual fee on EV owners. Analysts suggest this move could slow the growth of the EV market in the U.S. and hinder its competitiveness with China and Europe. Despite the potential setback, some believe the EV industry can still grow due to improving battery technology and falling prices.</p>

The bill's provisions, such as preserving a lower top tax rate and offering breaks tied to business income, state and local taxes and the estate tax, would largely favor top earners, while cuts to Medicaid and SNAP would adversely affect low-income individuals.</p>

The approach aims to address both Trump's concerns and the need for European countries to invest in hard military power.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple if the company does not shift iPhone manufacturing to the United States. Trump criticized Apple's decision to move part of its supply chain to India. Industry analysts consider a U.S.-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain highly unlikely due to time, expense, and higher labor costs. While the U.S. could potentially host final assembly, it would take years and result in higher prices for consumers, potentially driving them to cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The new review identified only about 20 books for removal pending further evaluation by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal follows a Pentagon memo requiring military services to remove books touching on diversity, race, and gender issues. The Navy's initial search used its own terms, leading to the removal of a broader range of titles, most of which have now been returned to circulation.</p>

          <p>Homeowners insurance costs are rising significantly in states within Tornado Alley, primarily due to the increasing frequency and severity of hailstorms.

Climate change is contributing to more extreme weather, including the potential for larger hailstones, prompting insurers to scale back coverage and increase rates.</p>

The princess, who is pursuing a graduate program at Harvard, may be affected by the ban, raising questions about her ability to continue her studies.

The discovery marks one of the oldest cold case identifications using investigative genetic genealogy, providing closure to the captain's descendants.</p>

          <p>Experts are advising homeowners on the best and worst ways to utilize a home equity line of credit (HELOC) this summer. HELOCs offer flexibility with variable rates, making them advantageous for consolidating credit card debt or funding home improvements. However, they caution against using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or pools, which may not generate financial returns or increase home value. It's also wise to use a HELOC for college costs or buying a new house only if other options are not available.</p>
