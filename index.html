          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of his concert tour dates through early July 2026 following a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The 76-year-old singer revealed that the condition has been exacerbated by recent performances, leading to issues with his hearing, vision, and balance. Joel's doctor has advised him to undergo physical therapy and refrain from performing during his recovery. Fans who purchased tickets for upcoming shows will receive automatic refunds, as Joel looks forward to returning to the stage when his health improves. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a brain condition that is most common in people over 65 and involves a buildup of fluid inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions.</p>

          <p>Energy experts are warning that the proposed GOP tax bill could negatively impact decarbonization efforts in the United States, potentially reversing gains made through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The bill includes provisions that would repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits, affecting solar panel installations and electric vehicle incentives. Republican senators have voiced concerns about the potential disruptions to energy projects and job losses, as billions of dollars in clean energy investments have benefited Republican-led states. Environmental policy experts also expressed worry over provisions that could allow polluters to avoid oversight by paying a fee.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, one of the 20th century‚Äôs most influential choreographers and the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet for over three decades, passed away at the age of 98. Grigorovich is best known for his 1968 production of ‚ÄúSpartacus,‚Äù an epic ballet that became a signature piece for the Bolshoi, emphasizing athletic spectacle and emotion. His choreography marked a departure from the Soviet-era ‚Äúdrambalet,‚Äù focusing instead on dance and athleticism. While celebrated in Russia, some Western critics found his work lacking in subtlety compared to choreographers like George Balanchine, but his impact on Russian ballet remains significant. </p>

Budget director Russ Vought criticized the GAO's findings as politically motivated, arguing that the administration has the right to manage taxpayer dollars effectively.

This move followed a week of bond market volatility driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, granting a temporary restraining order after Harvard filed a lawsuit. Harvard argued that the administration's move was a violation of the First Amendment and due process, triggered by the university's alleged failure to comply with demands for information on student visa holders. The administration claimed Harvard fostered an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students and promoted pro-Hamas sympathies.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet indicates that contrast-enhanced mammography, which uses iodine-based dye, can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound. While MRI scans also show higher detection rates than standard mammography, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely implemented. The study, involving over 9,000 women with dense breast tissue, found that contrast-enhanced mammography detected 19.2 cancers per 1,000 exams, compared to 4.2 with ultrasound. The technique is not yet approved for screening in the United States due to concerns over allergic reactions to the contrast agent, though most tumors detected were invasive and potentially life-threatening.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the move is a violation of the First Amendment and the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, impacting over 7,000 visa holders. Harvard argues that the action is retaliatory and aims to control the university's governance, curriculum, and ideology. A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the policy from taking effect while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the intersection where he died, now known as George Floyd Square, remains a focal point of community division in Minneapolis. Some view the square as a vital community hub and memorial that must be preserved, while others see it as a reminder of a tragic event hindering the neighborhood's progress. This disagreement has led to a standstill in the city's efforts to determine the square's future, with business owners suing the city over safety concerns and community members advocating for different visions of progress, ranging from a pedestrian mall to open streets.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded that Apple manufacture iPhones in the United States or face tariffs of at least 25% on imported iPhones. Apple has been shifting production to countries like India, Vietnam, and Thailand, but most iPhones are still made in China. Experts suggest that producing iPhones in the U.S. would be expensive and could double the price to $2,000 or more due to higher labor costs and the need for automation. China offers a vast workforce with specialized skills, making it difficult for Apple to replicate its supply chain in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package passed by the House of Representatives includes significant spending cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The legislation would reduce Medicaid spending by approximately $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion. These cuts, the largest in the programs' histories, aim to offset the bill's $3 trillion increase to the national debt. House Republicans seek to curb spending through new work requirements and eligibility checks, while some Republican leaders point to rooting out abuse of SNAP benefits.</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced a downturn following President Trump's threats to impose new tariffs on Apple and the European Union. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all declined, reflecting investor concerns about the potential impact on global trade. Trump's threats included a 25% tariff on Apple products made outside the U.S. and a 50% tariff on goods from the EU. Analysts express concern about the uncertainty caused by these trade policies, while the bond market signals worries about rising debt and an unsustainable fiscal trajectory.

          <p>A report suggesting the Trump administration is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from South Korea has raised concerns in the country, particularly ahead of a snap presidential election. The plan involves potentially moving around 4,500 troops to other locations in the Indo-Pacific region. Since Trump's first term, fears have persisted about the U.S. reducing its military presence in South Korea, with some politicians advocating for the development of South Korea's own nuclear weapons. The U.S. military has largely been guarded against reducing the U.S. troop size in South Korea.</p>
