        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman has stated that Starmer does not believe trans women are women, citing a recent Supreme Court judgment that defines a woman as a biological woman under the Equality Act. This marks a shift from Starmer's previous statement in 2022, where he stated that trans women are women and that is the law. The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to use women-only spaces. Starmer's spokesman emphasized that single-sex spaces are protected by law and that trans women should be treated with dignity and respect. The Supreme Court ruling has brought clarity to this matter, influencing the government's guidance. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>Gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, resulting in at least five deaths and multiple injuries. The attack occurred in Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in the Himalayas, and prompted a swift response from security forces who have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack, vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice, while Home Minister Amit Shah is scheduled to visit Srinagar for an emergency meeting. Initial reports suggest the gunmen may have targeted non-Muslims, exacerbating tensions in the region which has a long-running history of insurgency. Optimism Score: 5</p>

Despite this, a wave of attacks targeted various Ukrainian cities, including Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, and Odesa, causing casualties and damage. Zelensky condemned the attacks as "deliberate Russian terror" and reiterated his proposal for a 30-day cessation of strikes on civilian infrastructure. Optimism Score: 20</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its U.S. growth forecast for 2025 to 1.8% from 2.7%, attributing the revision to trade tensions stemming from recently implemented tariffs. The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, noted that weakening consumer confidence and consumption indicators also played a role in the downward adjustment. The IMF also increased its estimate of recession odds in the U.S. to 40%, up from 25% in October 2024, and cut its global growth forecast. The IMF also revised its expectations for headline inflation for advanced economies to 2.5% for 2025, reflecting an increase of 0.4 percentage point from January's projection.

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has granted a temporary restraining order requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose statuses were allegedly unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively ending the students' status and making them deportable. The judge ordered the administration to notify the court upon compliance and prohibited the use of the plaintiffs' identities outside the lawsuit.

          <p>Google is contending that the Justice Department's (DOJ) proposal to break up the company would harm the U.S. in the global race with China, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). As the remedies trial commences, Google argues that the U.S. needs the company in its current form to compete effectively with China and uphold national security. The DOJ has suggested that Google divest its Chrome browser unit and open its search data to rivals, a move Google claims would hinder its AI development and subject its products to government regulation. Google lost a separate antitrust case last week, when a federal judge ruled Thursday that Google held illegal monopolies in online advertising markets due to its position between ad buyers and sellers.

          <p>Leeds United and Burnley face challenges in maintaining their Premier League status due to profit and sustainability rules (PSR) and financial disparities. The trend of promoted teams being immediately relegated is increasing, hindered by PSR, which punishes clubs for losses exceeding £105m over three years. Burnley's CFO notes that promoted clubs have significantly lower wages compared to established Premier League teams, making it difficult to compete. Clubs must find innovative strategies to succeed, as outspending opponents is not a viable option. Optimism Score: 50</p>

          <p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, born in 1775, was one of the greatest Romantic painters and captured the grandeur of nature as well as the power of machines on canvas. Turner mastered the interplay of light, color, and atmosphere like no other, drawing inspiration from nature and his travels to the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy, and Germany. His artistic style evolved, particularly during his visits to Venice, where his landscape paintings became increasingly blurred, mystical, and flooded with light.

Diets high in sugar can lead to insulin resistance, increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammation, and even cognitive decline. Loud noise can cause hearing loss, which is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, as the brain has to work harder to process sounds.
