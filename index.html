          <p>Reports from Navan and the Global Business Travel Association indicate a 15% year-over-year increase in corporate travel spending for Q2 2025. However, optimism has waned due to trade tensions and economic pressures, with projected annual growth revised downward. Companies are becoming more strategic, prioritizing essential relationship-building trips over large group events and seeking more efficient travel arrangements. This cautious approach reflects a "wait and see" mode among C-suite leaders managing ongoing policy uncertainties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies have surged dramatically, driven by a revival of interest from retail traders on platforms like Reddit's WallStreetBets. The stock, which traded under $1 for much of the year, saw its price triple in days amid massive trading volume and significant short interest. This rally is fueled by social media hype and heightened options trading, reminiscent of the 2021 meme stock phenomenon. Analysts note that surges in call buying are causing extreme price moves for a small segment of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that current annuity rates are highly competitive, with some providers offering yields over 7% due to the elevated interest rate environment and increased market competition. This has led to a surge in annuity sales as retirees and pre-retirees seek to lock in guaranteed income. However, advisors caution that these rates may not last if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates in the future. They stress that annuities are not suitable for everyone, particularly those who may need liquid assets or have insufficient savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that while he believes the Federal Reserve needs an internal review of its operations, he does not think Chair Jerome Powell should step down. Bessent suggested that monetary policy should remain independent, but the Fed's non-monetary functions have grown without sufficient oversight and need to be "right-sized." This position contrasts with President Trump's calls for Powell's resignation and demands for dramatic interest rate cuts. Bessent's call for a review follows scrutiny of the Fed's spending, including a costly building renovation project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese exports saw a 5.8% year-over-year increase in June, fueled by a rush of orders from U.S. companies trying to stock up before a potential reinstatement of higher tariffs. Despite this short-term boost, exports to the United States were still down 16% from the previous year, though this was an improvement from May's sharper decline. Overall, China's global trade hit a record in the first half of the year as it diversified its markets, particularly in Southeast Asia and Europe. However, economists predict that sustained high tariffs will likely slow export growth in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Hunter Biden expressed anger toward actor George Clooney, whose public questioning of Joe Biden's fitness for office contributed to the former president ending his 2024 re-election campaign. Clooney had written a New York Times op-ed after a fundraising event, stating the president appeared diminished and that Democrats needed a new nominee. Hunter Biden vehemently disputed this account, accusing Clooney of exaggerating his father's condition and suggesting the intervention was motivated by policy disagreements over Israel. Joe Biden ultimately stepped aside for Kamala Harris, who lost the election to Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," effective when the host's contract ends in May 2026, citing a "purely financial decision." However, the move is fueling speculation that it is politically motivated, coming shortly after Colbert criticized a $16 million settlement between parent company Paramount Global and Donald Trump. Critics, including Jon Stewart, suggest the cancellation is an act of "fear and pre-compliance" as Paramount seeks to merge with Skydance Media, a deal President Trump could potentially block. The decision is being seen by some as symbolic of the decline of late-night political comedy.</p>

          <p>Lenders are increasingly offering promotional rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to attract borrowers in a high-rate environment. While introductory rates as low as 3.99% can be tempting, financial experts urge homeowners to be cautious and read the fine print. These offers often come with conditions, such as the rate jumping significantly after the promotional period ends or penalties for early repayment. Advisors recommend that borrowers understand the fully indexed rate, evaluate long-term costs, and ensure the product aligns with their financial goals before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This travel essay from The Atlantic reflects on the life and work of author John le Carré (David Cornwell) through the lens of Corfu, a key location in his novel "A Perfect Spy." The author explores how le Carré's tumultuous relationship with his con-man father, Ronnie, shaped his fiction, blending espionage with deep personal trauma. The piece connects the island's layered history of foreign influence and shifting identities to le Carré's own life of secrets, affairs, and literary creation. It posits that "A Perfect Spy" was the author's successful attempt to confront his past by overlaying it onto a spy thriller framework.</p>

The U.S. previously left UNESCO under Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump's first term, rejoining under George W. Bush and Joe Biden, respectively.

          <p>Following Coca-Cola's announcement that it will offer a cane sugar version of its soda, health experts are weighing in on the nutritional differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. Dietitians note that while their chemical structures vary slightly, both are added sugars that have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. High-fructose corn syrup contains a slightly higher percentage of fructose, which some experts link to a greater risk of metabolic diseases and inflammation. However, both sweeteners provide the same number of calories and have a similar effect on blood sugar, with moderation being the key recommendation for consumers.</p>
