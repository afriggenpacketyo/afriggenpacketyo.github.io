          <p>This opinion piece highlights seven stories from July deemed "crazy" by the author, including a lawsuit against the Blue Angels over a cat's "terror" and climate activists' demands to end the airshows. The article also covers a summer law associate who allegedly bit colleagues, historian Ken Burns's defense of PBS, and media reactions to a Sydney Sweeney jeans advertisement. The author presents these events with a critical and satirical tone, framing them as examples of leftist absurdity and media overreactions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of prominent Jewish American organizations, including some traditionally staunch supporters of Israel, are publicly calling for more humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza. Groups like the American Jewish Committee and the Reform movement have issued statements expressing deep sorrow for Palestinian civilian suffering and urging Israel to alleviate the worsening food insecurity. This shift reflects a broadening discomfort beyond the Jewish left, as rabbis and community leaders protest the crisis and sign letters demanding action. The trend aligns with declining U.S. public support for Israel's military actions.</p>

          <p>Business owners in Southern California's "Little India" are bracing for the impact of a new 25% tariff on goods imported from India, expressing deep concern for their survival. Grocers, jewelers, and apparel stores that rely on Indian imports state they will have no choice but to pass the increased costs onto consumers, which they fear will lead to a significant drop in sales. The tariffs add to existing anxieties within the community, with many small, family-owned businesses already experiencing a slowdown in customer traffic and economic uncertainty.

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee locations in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted decisively to unionize, joining the Blue Bottle Independent Union. This move follows a successful organizing effort by the same independent union at Boston-area stores last year. The California workers are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and greater transparency from the Nestlé-owned company. This unionization is part of a broader trend of organizing efforts seen at cafes across the U.S., including major chains like Starbucks.</p>

          <p>The animated Netflix film "K-pop Demon Hunters" has become a cultural phenomenon in South Korea, celebrated for its authentic and detailed portrayal of Korean culture, folklore, and daily life. South Korean viewers have praised the movie for its accurate depiction of local mannerisms, from dining etiquette to the pronunciation of "ramyeon." The film's success highlights the increasingly fluid boundaries of the "K-wave," demonstrating how cultural products created by the diaspora can achieve widespread popularity and a sense of verisimilitude within South Korea itself. Its popularity has led to sold-out merchandise and chart-topping music.</p>

          <p>This opinion column refutes claims that the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA title is illegitimate due to the unique "bubble" format created during the COVID-19 pandemic. The author argues that dismissing the championship ignores the immense courage and mental fortitude required for players to compete while isolated during a global health crisis. The piece contends that jealousy fuels the criticism and that the victory should be honored with an exclamation point, not an asterisk, for overcoming unprecedented challenges. It highlights the human cost of the pandemic that even athletes were not immune to.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Álvaro Uribe to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, a landmark ruling marking the first time a Colombian head of state has been convicted in a criminal trial. Uribe was found guilty of paying jailed paramilitary members to retract testimony linking him to the creation of right-wing militia groups during the country's civil war. While prosecutors sought a prison term, the court ordered him to serve the sentence at his rural estate. The verdict is seen by human rights groups as a major step for accountability in Colombia.</p>

The administration's aggressive tariff strategy has led to wild swings in trade, with imports surging and then plunging as businesses grapple with policy uncertainty.

From the UK's Prime Minister offering a "special" invitation from the King to Israel's Prime Minister nominating him for a Nobel Peace Prize, leaders appear to have learned that appealing to Trump's desire to be seen as a winner is an effective strategy. Analysts suggest this is a shift from his first term, as leaders now recognize that dealing directly with Trump, rather than his aides, is essential to achieving their goals.</p>

Furthermore, a projected 11.5% increase in Medicare Part B premiums is expected to consume a significant portion of the COLA increase.

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has called the transfer situation involving star striker Alexander Isak "complex" and "far from ideal." The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the Swedish forward, who has been training alone at his former club in Spain after being left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour with a minor injury. Howe stated he learned of the bid and Isak's whereabouts through the media and is not in direct contact with the player. Despite the uncertainty, the manager expressed his wish to see Isak play for Newcastle again.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), just hours after the agency released a jobs report that was weaker than economists had expected. On social media, Trump claimed without evidence that the figures were "RIGGED" to make him look bad, a move that critics condemned as an attack on the integrity of government data. The firing, which came amid market jitters over the administration's tariff policies, was described by former officials as a tactic used in authoritarian countries, destroying public trust in official statistics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's latest round of tariffs has sent shockwaves through the global economy, causing stock markets to fall and prompting reactions from key trade allies. The new duties, which will affect countries including Canada, India, and Switzerland, have created widespread uncertainty. European stocks hit a four-week low, and US markets opened sharply lower in response to the news and a weaker-than-expected domestic jobs report. Several nations have expressed hope they can negotiate a solution before the tariffs take effect, while industries like French wine producers warn of a brutal impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee are searching for Austin Robert Drummond, a 28-year-old man suspected of killing four of his relatives. The victims were identified as the parents, grandmother, and uncle of a seven-month-old baby girl who was found abandoned but safe in a front yard. Police believe Drummond dropped off the infant and alerted people to her presence in an act of "compassion" before fleeing. The suspect, who was out on bond for other charges including attempted murder, is considered armed and dangerous, and a reward has been offered for information.</p>

          <p>A major rescue operation is in progress in central Chile to reach five miners trapped after a partial collapse at the El Teniente copper mine, the world's largest underground copper mine. The collapse was triggered by a magnitude 4.2 earth tremor, which also killed one other miner. Rescue teams are working to clear debris to reach the workers, who are trapped at a depth of over 900 meters, though no contact has been established yet. The state-run copper company Codelco has halted all operations at the mine and pledged to do everything possible to save the trapped men.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pioneering study led by Chinese scientists has revealed an ancient evolutionary connection between the potato and a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers traced the tuber's origins back nine million years to a hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient cross-pollination was a key driver in the development of tubers, the edible part that has made the potato a global staple food. The findings, published in the journal Cell, shed new light on the diversification of this crucial crop.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's order that temporarily blocks the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration enforcement patrols in Southern California. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government cannot use factors like race, language, or location as the sole basis for stopping someone. The original order came after a lawsuit accused federal agents of systematically violating the Constitution by targeting people based on their appearance. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in the region.</p>
