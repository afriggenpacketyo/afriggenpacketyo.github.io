        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Democrats have fled the state to prevent a Republican-led redistricting vote by denying a quorum. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the lawmakers from office, citing a nonbinding attorney general opinion, and House Speaker Dustin Burrows has signed civil arrest warrants. However, legal experts and the lawmakers themselves assert that Texas DPS lacks out-of-state jurisdiction and that the governor's threats of removal or bribery charges are legally tenuous. The standoff continues as the special legislative session's clock runs down, though the governor can call more sessions.</p>

The successful transplant has given Warsaw a new lease on life, allowing her to spend more time with her family, while strengthening the bond between the two sisters.</p>

The Department of Justice announced the conviction, highlighting that 190 dogs were seized from his property, the largest number ever in a federal dog fighting case. Johnson, who had a prior state-level conviction for the same crime, now faces a potential sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count.

          <p>The Republican-controlled Texas House has voted to issue civil arrest warrants for the dozens of Democratic legislators who left the state to block a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The move, largely symbolic as the warrants are not enforceable outside Texas, empowers state troopers to detain the lawmakers and return them to the capitol if they re-enter the state. Governor Greg Abbott has supported the action, ordering state police to locate and return the members. The Democrats, currently in Illinois, maintain their protest is necessary to protect the democratic process from partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that the state has spent over $5 million in the last six months on legal challenges against the Trump administration, resulting in nearly $170 billion in saved federal funding for California. Bonta stated that for every dollar of special funding spent, the state has seen a return of $33,600. The lawsuits have successfully blocked cuts to transportation, education, and healthcare funding, with the largest victory preventing a freeze on federal funds that constituted a third of the state's budget.

The province is already seeing growth, with a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in visitors to its special medical zone in the first quarter of 2025.

An analysis of three large canceled HHS contracts, which DOGE claimed saved $6.4 billion, shows the actual savings are closer to $165 million. Experts note that DOGE is reporting the total potential value of contracts as savings, a ceiling rarely reached, rather than the obligated funds left unspent. Overall, the initiative claims to have saved $199 billion, but critics describe the accounting as "transparency theater." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest while he stands trial for allegedly leading a coup attempt following his 2022 election loss. Justice Alexandre de Moraes issued the order after Bolsonaro violated previous bail conditions by addressing a political rally via a live call, which was broadcast by his allies. The new restrictions also ban Bolsonaro from receiving most visitors and led to the seizure of his mobile phones. The move comes a day after tens of thousands of his supporters protested, calling for his amnesty.</p>

CEO Alex Karp credited the growth to a "confluence of the arrival of language models" and the company's software infrastructure, noting significant revenue jumps in both its U.S. government and commercial sectors.

As the U.S. and its allies seek to diversify their sources and reduce this dependency, developing countries with significant rare earth reserves are becoming a new geopolitical front line. However, analysts note that Western efforts have so far lacked the investment needed to build alternative supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed rule would eliminate access to the procedure at VA facilities, even in states with near-total abortion bans, where more than half of female veterans reside.
