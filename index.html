Gauff credited the presence of superstar gymnast Simone Biles in the crowd for providing a crucial sense of calm and inspiration, helping her to compose herself and find a way to win despite her struggles. The article highlights Gauff's ongoing efforts to overhaul her serve with a new biomechanics expert, a drastic measure that has added significant pressure during this high-stakes tournament. Despite the public unravelling, Gauff demonstrated remarkable resilience, limiting her errors in the second set and expressing confidence in her ability to overcome such adversity as she advances to the next round.</p>

          <p>Cambricon, a Chinese artificial intelligence chip company often referred to as "little Nvidia," has issued a cautionary statement to investors, warning that its stock price risks deviating from current fundamentals. This comes after the company's Shanghai-listed shares saw an extraordinary 533% increase over the past year, fueled by China's supportive policies for local AI chip development and new AI models. The article also notes Cambricon's vulnerability to supply chain disruptions due to its inclusion on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List, which could adversely affect its operating performance. Despite its impressive market performance, the company advises investors to be aware of substantial trading risks associated with its current valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former world number one Naomi Osaka strongly condemned Jelena Ostapenko's recent comments to Taylor Townsend at the US Open, calling them "one of the worst things you could say to a black tennis player." Ostapenko reportedly told Townsend she had "no class" and "no education" after a second-round match, sparking significant criticism. While Townsend, an African-American, stated she didn't personally perceive a racial undertone, she acknowledged the historical stigma within her community regarding education. Osaka emphasized the "ill timing" and the deeply problematic historical context of such remarks in a predominantly white sport, asserting Townsend's intelligence and hard work.</p>

          <p>From January 2026, the NHS in England and Wales will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children, delivered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, integrated with the existing MMR jab. This significant public health initiative aims to protect children from the severe, albeit rare, complications of the varicella virus, and is also expected to save an estimated £24 million annually in lost income and productivity for working families. A catch-up campaign will ensure that slightly older children also receive the vaccination. This article underscores the benefits of this new policy, which aligns the UK with other countries already offering the vaccine.</p>

On his podcast, Rooney recounted that Sir Alex Ferguson initially preferred to wait another year, but United had to move swiftly to prevent him from signing with Newcastle, a move he was prepared to make. He also disclosed a close call with Chelsea, which he declined due to their plan to loan him to Middlesbrough.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks his first in seven years, signaling a potential easing of strained relations between the two Asian giants. Despite deep-seated suspicions, including unresolved border disputes and China's close ties with Pakistan, economic pressures like U.S. tariffs are pushing Beijing and New Delhi towards a reluctant cooperation. The article highlights India's significant and widening trade deficit with China, alongside its reliance on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods for its ambitious manufacturing sector. While the summit may not resolve long-standing geopolitical issues, it could indicate a mutual willingness to find common ground and strengthen economic engagement.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline detailing the unprecedented turmoil that has plagued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marked by extensive mass layoffs, numerous high-profile resignations, and significant shifts in vaccine policy. Since November 2024, under the influence of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the CDC has seen its director ousted, its independent vaccine advisory panels completely replaced, and a reduction in recommended COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The article meticulously details the departures of senior officials who explicitly cited profound concerns over scientific independence and the perceived "weaponization" of public health. This timeline highlights the ongoing, profound challenges to the agency's long-standing credibility and its core public health mission.</p>

          <p>The UK government has directed contractor Mitie to withdraw job postings for floristry and "ballooncraft" tutors at an immigration removal center near Heathrow Airport, following significant public and political backlash. These roles, which offered annual salaries of nearly £39,000, were advertised alongside positions like gym manager, prompting strong criticism from opposition politicians. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp argued that taxpayer money should be focused on deportations rather than providing such "perks." Home Office minister Seema Malhotra confirmed that not all advertised roles were considered necessary.

          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers who were previously convicted on charges related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. Judge Sheryl Lipman cited significant concerns about potential bias, stemming from allegations that the original presiding judge suggested one of the defendants was a gang member after a separate incident. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of the more serious charge of violating Nichols's civil rights by causing his death. This article underscores the ongoing legal complexities and the challenges of ensuring an impartial judicial process in high-profile cases of police brutality, which had previously ignited nationwide protests.</p>

Iran's foreign minister disputes the E3's legal jurisdiction for this action and maintains a stated willingness for "fair and balanced" negotiations.
