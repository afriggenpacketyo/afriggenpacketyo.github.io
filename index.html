          <p>Air Canada has suspended all of its mainline flight operations after 10,000 of its flight attendants initiated a strike, causing widespread travel disruptions. The union, CUPE, states that contract negotiations stalled over key issues like wages that have not kept pace with inflation and compensation for unpaid work hours. The grounding of Canada's largest airline during the peak summer season is affecting an estimated 100,000 passengers daily. The Canadian government is now under significant pressure to intervene, as the airline has requested binding arbitration to resolve the dispute while the union prefers continued negotiation.</p>

          <p>An internal review revealed that Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer known as the “devil in the Ozarks,” spent six months planning his escape from an Arkansas prison. He exploited lax security in the kitchen where he worked to gather supplies, fashioning a fake law enforcement uniform and badge to simply walk out of a gate. The report highlights multiple security failures, including unsupervised access and a guard unlocking a gate without verifying identity, which led to the termination of two employees. Hardin survived in the wilderness for over a week before his recapture, prompting calls for systemic security overhauls at the facility.</p>

          <p>Torrential monsoon rains have triggered catastrophic flash floods across northern Pakistan and parts of India, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people. In Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone, over 300 fatalities have been reported, with many victims swept away or trapped in collapsed buildings. Rescue operations are severely hampered by persistent rainfall, landslides, and washed-out roads, making it difficult to reach remote areas. The disaster was compounded by the crash of a rescue helicopter in Pakistan, which killed five crew members, highlighting the perilous conditions faced by emergency responders in the region.</p>

Semenyo received support from players on both teams and was praised for his courage in reporting the abuse. The incident has been widely condemned by the Premier League, the Football Association, and anti-discrimination groups, who are calling for strong action to be taken.</p>

Devon and Cornwall Police successfully argued in court that the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, obtaining a forfeiture order under the Proceeds of Crime Act. This action follows a previous seizure of £2.7 million from Tate and his brother for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. Police stated the seized funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives within the community.</p>

          <p>An executive director of the Israel National Cyber Directorate, Tom Artiom Alexandrovich, was arrested in Nevada as part of an undercover sting operation targeting online child predators. He faces a felony charge of luring a child via computer for a sex act after being apprehended during a two-week operation by the state's Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The official was in Las Vegas to attend a major cybersecurity conference. Following the arrest, his professional LinkedIn page was deleted, and the Israeli Prime Minister's office issued a statement downplaying the incident, claiming he was only questioned and not arrested.</p>

          <p>A group of four masked individuals executed a rapid, broad-daylight robbery of a family-owned jewelry store in Seattle, stealing merchandise valued at over $2 million in just 90 seconds. The suspects used hammers to smash through the front door and display cases at Menashe and Sons Jeweler, brandishing a Taser and bear spray at employees. Among the stolen items were high-value Rolex watches and a $125,000 emerald necklace. The suspects fled in a getaway car, and police are currently investigating the incident, which has left the store's staff shaken and forced a temporary closure.</p>

          <p>A new wave of book removals is sweeping through Florida schools, as districts pull hundreds of titles from shelves to avoid potential state government retaliation. This follows a warning from the state board of education to Hillsborough County, which led to the removal of over 600 books, including classics like "The Diary of Anne Frank." Fearing similar consequences, at least nine other districts have proactively removed books, often targeting titles by authors of color or those discussing LGBTQ+ themes. Critics, including PEN America, have labeled the actions as state-driven censorship designed to erase diverse voices from public education.</p>

Instead of a rigid schedule, she uses this time flexibly for activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog, which helps foster creativity and rejuvenation. She also advocates for getting fully dressed for work, even when remote, to maintain a motivated and professional mindset throughout the day.</p>

However, its strength is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast from August 20th to the 27th. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for significant beach erosion and dangerous surf conditions, even as the storm itself is forecast to remain at sea.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decline in young adults aged 25-34 achieving traditional milestones such as moving out, securing a job, getting married, and having children. In 1975, nearly half of young adults had met all four markers, whereas today that figure has dropped to less than a quarter. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living and job instability, which make financial independence more difficult to attain. Changing societal attitudes also play a role, with marriage now often viewed as a "capstone" to be pursued only after achieving economic stability.</p>

Many Ukrainians felt the warm reception for the Russian president, which included a red carpet and military flyover, served to legitimize a leader responsible for an ongoing war of aggression. Political analysts and citizens in Kyiv described the pageantry as inappropriate and irrational, arguing that it was staged to please Putin and undermined the gravity of the conflict. The friendly gestures and lack of public condemnation from Trump struck a deeply sour note for those directly affected by the war.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard smartphone design. While Apple still leads with 49% of the market, its share has declined, signaling renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may respond with its own foldable iPhone in the coming years to counter Samsung's momentum and appeal to consumers seeking new designs.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Engine Capital has acquired a significant stake in life sciences company Avantor and is publicly urging its board to implement substantial changes. In a detailed letter, Engine Capital criticized the company's underperformance, flawed leadership, and poor capital allocation, including costly acquisitions made at peak market valuations. The activist firm has proposed a multi-pronged plan that includes optimizing the company's portfolio, reducing costs, refreshing the board, and using free cash flow for stock buybacks. Engine suggests these actions could significantly increase shareholder value or, alternatively, the company should consider a sale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited a series of posts in which Stewartson accused Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to challenge the judgment, calling it a frivolous attempt to intimidate him.</p>

The sonar detected a submerged car, which divers later recovered and found to contain human remains.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Farmers in the U.S. Midwest are grappling with a perfect storm of financial and environmental challenges, squeezed by the impacts of President Trump's trade tariffs and the climate crisis. Extreme weather patterns, including last year's drought and this year's excessive rainfall, have significantly reduced crop yields for staples like corn and soybeans. Compounding this, retaliatory tariffs have caused a steep decline in exports to China, once a primary market, leading to low crop prices. This dual pressure has placed immense strain on the farm economy, with rising operating costs further eroding already thin profit margins for many agricultural producers.</p>

          <p>Police officers who were injured defending the Capitol on January 6, 2021, are criticizing President Trump's recent decision to deploy the National Guard to address crime in Washington D.C. They point out the irony that Trump hesitated for hours to send the Guard during the violent insurrection but was quick to do so now for what city leaders say is not a crime crisis. The former officers view the deployment as a political maneuver and a misguided strategy, expressing doubt that troops without arrest powers can effectively combat the root causes of crime. They see it as a troubling flex of authority rather than a genuine public safety effort.</p>

While these well-known figures are seen as the party's best chance to compete in right-leaning states, their recruitment underscores a potential lack of a deep bench of younger, viable candidates, a point of frustration for some party activists.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing, survivors in Hiroshima, known as hibakusha, are making a final, urgent plea for the abolition of nuclear weapons amid a growing arms race in Asia. Toshiyuki Mimaki, 83, shares his experiences with schoolchildren, trying to pass on the lessons of the tragedy to a new generation. However, their message of peace faces a challenging global landscape, as nuclear-armed states expand their arsenals. Japan itself is in a contradictory position, calling for abolition while relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for its security, a stance that frustrates the aging survivors.</p>

However, missed payments can lead to significant fees and damage credit scores.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing significant lineup challenges after placing third baseman Max Muncy on the injured list with a strained oblique muscle. Muncy is a key left-handed bat who provides balance and power, and his previous absence this season coincided with a major slump in the team's run production. With Muncy out, the Dodgers' offense becomes more vulnerable to right-handed pitching, placing greater pressure on other hitters like Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, and Teoscar Hernández to step up. The injury comes at a critical time as the team is tied for first place in its division with 40 games left to play.</p>

          <p>Analysis following the Alaska summit suggests that the meeting was a significant diplomatic victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was received with high honors by the U.S. without offering any tangible concessions. Foreign policy experts noted that the event marked a remarkable return to the global stage for Putin, who has been largely isolated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite the lack of a concrete deal to end the war, the optics of the summit and Trump's deferential tone are seen as having strengthened Putin's position. Trump's brief and vague remarks contrasted with Putin's more composed and lengthy statements, reinforcing this perception.</p>
