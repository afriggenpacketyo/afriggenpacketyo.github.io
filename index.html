          <p>A man and his dog were killed in a suspected black bear attack in Collier County, Florida, prompting a search for the animal by state wildlife officials. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) is investigating the incident near Jerome, east of Naples, and is urging residents to avoid the area. Florida's black bear population has been rebounding, leading to more frequent sightings and interactions with humans, particularly in rural areas. Authorities are expected to release more information as the investigation progresses, but caution residents to remain vigilant and avoid approaching wildlife in the vicinity of the attack.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit in partnership with the Trump administration to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested tariffs on movies filmed overseas. This proposal would be the largest government subsidy for the industry in the United States, supplementing existing state incentives. The move follows Trump's call for a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the U.S., which caused confusion in Hollywood. Senator Adam Schiff also indicated his office was working on a federal film incentive proposal.</p>

          <p>Michael Rogers, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) top official overseeing drug and food safety inspections, abruptly resigned after 34 years with the agency. His resignation comes amid reported frustration among inspectors with FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary's policies, including cuts to the inspections workforce and plans to expand foreign surprise inspections. Officials expressed concern over the feasibility of increasing foreign inspections while reducing the length of inspection trips, warning of potential cuts in oversight quality and a drain on workforce morale. Rogers oversaw food inspections during the infant formula crisis in 2022 and the subsequent reorganization of the FDA's inspections office in 2024.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island expressed disbelief and skepticism after President Trump suggested reopening the former prison as a federal penitentiary.

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has begun sending grant terminations to arts organizations following President Trump's proposed budget, which calls for shutting down the agency. The terminations impact grant awards and offers made in November 2024. The NEA said it is updating its grant policies and priorities to focus funding on projects that align with the President's vision, including initiatives related to HBCUs, American independence, AI competency, and support for the military and veterans. Affected organizations have a limited time to appeal the withdrawal.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, with up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Democrats argue the legislation will hurt public schools, siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private education. President Trump supported the bill, indicating a broader plan to return education control to the states.</p>

Most of the voters are Musk's employees at SpaceX. Musk first proposed the idea in 2021. While SpaceX has generally received support from local officials, some critics are concerned that the creation of a company town will expand Musk's control over the area. SpaceX is seeking federal permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year.</p>
