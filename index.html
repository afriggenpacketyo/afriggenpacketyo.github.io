        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham discusses her new Netflix series, "Too Much," which is loosely inspired by her experiences moving to London. The show contrasts the romanticized, period-drama version of England with the modern-day reality of the city. Starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, the series follows a New Yorker who relocates across the Atlantic for work and navigates cultural differences. The 10-episode rom-com, produced by the company behind "Love Actually," also features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Stephen Fry, Emily Ratajkowski, and Andrew Scott.</p>

          <h2>China's Producer Prices See Steepest Decline in Nearly Two Years, Deepening Deflation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 00:07:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer prices fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant decline in almost two years and signaling deepening deflationary pressures. This drop, worse than economists' expectations, is fueled by an intense price war among manufacturers and sluggish consumer demand. Although the consumer price index edged up slightly, returning to growth after four months, experts remain cautious. They highlight persistent overcapacity and a weakening property sector as major challenges to the nation's economic stability, suggesting that aggressive price-cutting will likely continue.

          <h2>European Intelligence Agencies Warn of Escalating Russian Sabotage Campaign</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intelligence officials across Europe are raising alarms about an escalating sabotage campaign orchestrated by Russian intelligence services. This campaign involves disruptive acts like arson and planting explosives, increasingly carried out by amateur proxies recruited online to ensure deniability. A recent arson attack in London on a warehouse storing supplies for Ukraine exemplifies this strategy, with court documents revealing recruitment via Telegram channels. Officials express growing concern that as these operations become more violent and less controlled, the risk of serious injury or even death is significantly increasing.</p>

          <p>China has announced the completion of a massive 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, designed to contain the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. The project, part of a larger national effort to combat desertification, involved creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands. After securing the sand, workers planted drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul to establish a more permanent ecological barrier. This initiative aims to prevent sandstorms and protect agricultural land by building an effective sand prevention and control system in the region.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his approval for sending defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move he had previously resisted. During a cabinet meeting, Trump expressed his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a potential strain in their relationship. This U-turn comes after weeks of rejecting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's requests for defense support. The decision raises questions about the motivations behind the change and its implications for U.S.-Russia relations, as well as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>

Economists warn the new duties could push Japan into a technical recession and have already caused South Korea's central bank to nearly halve its 2025 GDP growth forecast.

          <p>China's commerce ministry has announced an immediate export ban on several Taiwanese companies involved in the aerospace, shipbuilding, and machinery sectors. The ministry stated the measure was necessary to safeguard "national security and interests" and fulfill international non-proliferation obligations. The new rules prohibit the export of dual-use items, which are materials and technologies with both civilian and military applications, to the specified entities. The notice requires an immediate halt to all ongoing exports, with exceptions requiring special approval from the ministry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a North Korean operative from the Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that generates revenue for the nation's weapons programs. Song is accused of facilitating a network where North Korean IT workers, operating from China and Russia, use stolen identities of U.S. citizens to secure remote work at foreign companies. This sprawling operation allows North Korea to clandestinely raise funds and, in some cases, infiltrate corporate networks. The sanctions also target four entities involved in a related Russia-based network.</p>

          <p>As forecasters predict an above-average 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, homeowners along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are increasingly turning to climate-resilient construction. These designs, such as the round, aerodynamic homes built by Deltec Homes, are engineered to withstand extreme weather, including winds up to 190 mph. Features like specialized roof trusses, deep anchors, and flood vents help reduce damage from high winds and storm surges. While these homes can cost more upfront, they often result in long-term savings, including lower insurance premiums, and provide greater peace of mind.</p>

The court alleges they have committed the crime against humanity of persecution on gender grounds against girls and women in Afghanistan. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has severely restricted women's rights, including access to education, and targeted individuals for their gender identity.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the metal's supply chain. The move, expected to take effect by the end of the month, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction. This action is part of a broader protectionist strategy that has already seen high tariffs placed on steel and aluminum, with similar investigations looming for other sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.

Since February, the NWS has lost approximately 600 staff members, including meteorologists and hydrologists, through firings and retirements under the Trump administration. While experts believe the NWS performed well in forecasting this specific event, they warn that continued staff reductions could compromise the agency's ability to provide critical warnings for future weather disasters.
