          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years, citing Iran's failure to fully cooperate with the agency regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities. In response, Iran condemned the resolution as a "political action" and announced plans to establish a new uranium enrichment facility at a "secure location" and replace existing centrifuges with more advanced machines. The resolution could further complicate talks between Tehran and Washington on a new nuclear agreement. Tensions in the Middle East are escalating, with the US advising non-essential staff to leave some embassies and reports suggesting Israel is prepared to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.
