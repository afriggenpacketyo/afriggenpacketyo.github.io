          <p>Four former housekeepers have filed a lawsuit against Motown singer Smokey Robinson and his wife, Frances Robinson, alleging sexual assault, sexual battery, false imprisonment, negligence, gender violence, and labor violations. The women, identified as Jane Does 1-4, claim Robinson sexually assaulted them at his properties in Chatsworth, Bell Canyon, and Las Vegas over several years, starting in 2006, often when his wife was away. The lawsuit also accuses Frances Robinson of contributing to a hostile work environment and using "ethnically pejorative words and language". The women are seeking $50 million in damages and a jury trial, citing fear of reprisal and public embarrassment as reasons for not reporting the alleged acts earlier.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the Defense Workforce Integration Act, designed to assist individuals disqualified from military service due to medical reasons in securing civilian positions within the armed forces and the defense industry. The bill seeks to address workforce shortages in critical sectors like manufacturing, cybersecurity, and defense logistics by leveraging the training and resources already invested in these recruits. Key provisions include directing the Department of Defense to provide information on civilian employment opportunities and expanding existing Air Force personnel management programs to the Army and Navy to facilitate recommendations to civilian hiring authorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, specifically an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders, arguing it will not disadvantage British workers. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the deal would boost the UK economy, leading to faster growth, higher wages, and increased tax revenue, and that Indian workers would still be required to pay the NHS immigration surcharge. Opposition parties claim the exemption could make Indian workers cheaper to employ, but Reynolds pointed out the UK has similar agreements with over 50 countries and that Indian workers would not be eligible for benefits from the National Insurance system. The deal aims to ease exports for UK firms, including the Scotch whisky industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Democratic leaders' pledges to prevent Donald Trump from profiting through government payments, high-profile Democrats have joined Republicans in introducing legislation that allows payments to be made in cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. This move raises concerns that Trump could require all government payments to be made with cryptocurrencies, potentially benefiting his own crypto venture. Experts and academics point out that these bills give crypto businesses access to the same payment systems as banks while subjecting them to weaker standards, potentially gutting consumer protections and privatizing the dollar. Critics also highlight potential conflicts of interest, as Trump has demonstrated a willingness to use his office to enrich his family and friends in the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing a concerning trend of declining participation in football among teenage boys, prompting the German FA (DFB) to initiate reforms aimed at revitalizing youth engagement. The country has lost nearly 6,000 men's U19 and U17 teams since 2006, raising concerns about the long-term future of football in Germany. The DFB is focusing on creating a more inclusive and enjoyable environment for young players, emphasizing fun over results and encouraging greater involvement in decision-making. Factors contributing to the decline include the rise of digital platforms, the cost of playing organized football, and the intense scheduling demands of youth sports.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, are pursuing a spending and tax cut package, primarily extending the 2017 tax law, to revitalize their political standing amid concerns about President Trump's economic policies. However, the author of the article argues that this strategy is unlikely to shield Republicans from the consequences of Trump's tariffs, which are already impacting the economy. The extension of the tax law, while preventing tax increases on working Americans, may not resonate with voters as a significant benefit. The article suggests that congressional leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policy to avoid further economic damage and potential losses in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Community Plate, an organization founded by Karl Schatz and Margaret Hathaway, aims to combat loneliness in rural Maine by creating potluck suppers where people can connect and share stories. These events bring together community members who may not know each other well, providing an opportunity to build relationships and combat the epidemic of loneliness. The organization emphasizes the importance of social connections for human health, happiness, and prosperity, and seeks to offer an antidote to loneliness and disconnection through simple gatherings centered around food and storytelling.</p>

          <p>Senior presidential adviser Kari Lake intends to integrate news reports from the far-right One America News Network (OAN) into the Voice of America's programming for foreign audiences. This decision has sparked indignation among agency and network veterans, who view it as a mockery of the agency's history of independent, non-partisan journalism. Lake's announcement follows earlier actions to silence Voice of America, freeze its website, and place nearly all staff on indefinite leave. Critics argue that OAN's resolute support of President Trump and its propagation of disproven claims about the 2020 election do not align with the network's mission to report reliable and authoritative news.</p>

          <p>Before becoming the infamous prison island, Alcatraz was originally known as Isla de Alcatrazes, named by Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala for the many pelicans inhabiting the island. Now, President Trump has ordered it to be rebuilt and reopened to house the country's "most ruthless and violent Offenders". Experts suggest this move is more symbolic, tapping into a register of law and order, and a way to express a kind of disdain for the National Park Service. The island's name has a complicated mix of language and history, with the word "alcatraz" tracing back to Arabic origins meaning "the diver."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady amid concerns that President Trump's tariffs could reignite inflation and slow economic growth. Despite pressure from Trump to lower interest rates, the Fed is likely to maintain its benchmark borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5% due to the potential inflationary impacts of the tariffs. Business surveys indicate widespread concern that Trump's tariffs are disrupting supply chains and driving up prices, which could force the Fed to keep interest rates relatively high to prevent inflation from spiking again. The worst-case scenario for the Fed would be if tariffs push both inflation and unemployment up, creating a difficult policy dilemma.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have largely shrugged off recent military tensions with Pakistan, with investors maintaining a positive outlook on India's growth prospects.

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), to support economic growth amid escalating trade tensions with the United States. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and lower the RRR by 50 basis points, injecting additional liquidity into the market. These measures aim to support financing for key sectors, including technology and real estate, and will be accompanied by a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While analysts believe these steps will provide some support, they note that domestic credit demand may remain subdued.</p>

However, under the new tariffs, a recent shipment incurred a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs.
