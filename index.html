          <p>Following U.S. President Trump's announcement of a "very successful attack" on three nuclear sites in Iran, world leaders have reacted with a mix of condemnation and support. Iranian officials have vowed to respond, while Israel praised the action. China strongly condemned the strikes, and the UN Secretary-General warned of dangerous escalation. The EU urged de-escalation, and Saudi Arabia expressed concern. Russia questioned Trump's Nobel Peace Prize nomination, while Japan called for calming the situation. The international community remains divided on the implications of the U.S. action and its potential impact on regional stability. Optimism regarding the situation is low.</p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection previously used for type 2 diabetes, is now available at GP surgeries in England, but eligibility is restricted to those with a BMI of 40 or over (37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and four out of five specific health conditions. NHS England plans a phased rollout to reach those most in need, while some GP practices caution that few patients will initially qualify. Pharmacy organizations express concern that demand may exceed supply, and training is needed for healthcare staff to administer the drug safely. The medicine makes you feel fuller so you eat less, and individuals will need to discuss potential side-effects with their GP or clinic.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. He warned Iran against retaliation and urged them to pursue a peace deal with Israel. The strikes involved B-2 Spirit bombers using "bunker-buster" bombs and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles. Defense officials reported severe damage to all three sites, while the U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically, stating that regime change was not planned. The situation remains tense, with mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers and concerns about potential Iranian reprisals.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation to announce U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, labeling the attack a "spectacular military success" and warning of further attacks if Iran does not pursue peace.

Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes but asserted that it would not halt their nuclear program, calling on the international community to condemn the attacks. Tensions remain high, with Iran vowing retaliation and the U.S. promising a stronger response.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen regarding potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil trade route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. Any disruption to oil flow through the strait could severely impact international energy markets and economies. While the U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that an Iranian effort to block the strait would be a "suicidal move" that would likely provoke backlash from numerous countries.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a clinic offering ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, providing an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution but is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack is blaming fearmongering on the left for the reluctance of hospital staff to give her the drugs she needed to end an ectopic pregnancy that threatened her life. Medical staff were worried about losing their licenses or going to jail if they did what she needed due to the state's new six week abortion ban. After contacting the governor's office, doctors eventually agreed to give her the medication, but the situation highlighted the confusion and fear surrounding abortion laws in the state. Cammack is now pregnant again and due to give birth soon.</p>

          <h2>Experts Say Iran's Nuclear Program Damaged, Not Destroyed, by Strikes</h2>

          <p>U.S. officials claim that strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have devastated the country's nuclear program, but independent experts analyzing satellite imagery disagree. The experts say that while the strikes were effective, key elements like enriched uranium stocks remain untouched. Trucks were seen sealing tunnels at key sites before the strike, potentially indicating the relocation of uranium. The experts emphasize that diplomatic agreements and additional inspections are necessary to fully end Iran's nuclear program.</p>
