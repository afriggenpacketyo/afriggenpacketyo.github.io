          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send federal troops to Portland, Oregon, to address what he terms "domestic terrorists" targeting federal facilities. The move is framed as a necessary action to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings, which have been sites of ongoing demonstrations. This deployment is part of a broader strategy of using federal force in American cities, a tactic that has drawn significant controversy and opposition from local officials, including Portland's mayor who stated federal intervention is not needed.</p>

          <p>Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has abruptly summoned hundreds of top-ranking generals and admirals from around the world to an unusual meeting in Virginia, causing widespread unease within the U.S. military. With little explanation provided, the gathering has fueled speculation that it could be a prelude to firings, a political "show of force" for the Trump administration, or an effort to enforce new military standards. The unprecedented nature of the summons has been described by retired generals as concerning and potentially performative, stirring anxiety about the politicization of the armed forces.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has publicly addressed Berkshire Hathaway's complete sale of its 17-year-long investment in the company, framing the divestment as a "completely normal" part of the investment cycle.

Despite this calm public posture, BYD's shares have fallen more than 6% this week amid signs of cooling growth and a reduced sales target for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite leading his party to a historic election victory, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing significant internal doubts about his leadership as the Labour Party conference approaches. According to a detailed analysis, senior party figures and MPs are frustrated with what they see as slow decision-making, poor communication, and a lack of a clear governing vision, which has contributed to poor polling against Reform UK. The conference is now viewed as a crucial moment for Starmer to reassert his authority and address the rising concerns within his party.</p>

This system is designed to fill a safety gap left by current in-air collision avoidance systems, which are typically not active at low altitudes.</p>

          <p>The recent federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey may be vulnerable to dismissal due to extensive public comments made by President Trump, according to legal experts. They argue that Trump's years of vitriolic attacks against Comey, coupled with his celebratory posts following the indictment, provide a strong basis for a defense motion of "selective or vindictive prosecution." The case's unusual circumstances, including the last-minute appointment of a new, inexperienced prosecutor, are seen as further evidence that the charges may be politically motivated.</p>

Experts argue that rather than compelling companies to hire Americans, the exorbitant fee will likely drive firms to move jobs offshore and deter top global talent from coming to the U.S. This could stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, as skilled immigrants have historically been a major driver of both.

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's new campaign memoir, "107 Days," finds that the book details the significant challenges she faced in the 2024 presidential race but lacks critical self-reflection on her own failures. The book reportedly places blame on external factors and her running mate, Tim Walz, for his debate performance, while offering little insight into her own policy shortcomings or inability to connect with key voter demographics. The reviewer concludes that the memoir inadvertently confirms she was not well-suited for a national ticket.</p>
