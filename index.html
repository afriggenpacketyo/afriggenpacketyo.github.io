          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has entered its third week with no resolution in sight, as Democrats express a profound lack of trust in President Donald Trump, preventing the formation of bipartisan negotiating groups. Unlike past shutdowns where such "gangs" helped break legislative deadlocks, lawmakers are now hesitant to craft agreements they fear the president might publicly reject. Democrats are demanding an ironclad deal on healthcare subsidies before reopening the government, citing past instances where Trump has scuttled bipartisan compromises.</p>

          <p>In promoting his new book, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson shared his perspectives on artificial intelligence and the possibility of alien contact. He argues that while AI can provide answers, it currently lacks the soul and personality inherent in human curiosity. Tyson also expressed skepticism about alien visitations to Earth, noting that despite the universal ownership of high-resolution cameras, there is a conspicuous absence of clear evidence of extraterrestrials, unlike the era of unverified eyewitness accounts.</p>

This influential decision will shape the campaign landscape, directing candidate attention and resources to the chosen states, which must represent diverse voter groups.

          <p>After more than six decades, CBS News is closing its workspace in the Pentagon, joining nearly every other major news organization in declining to sign new press requirements. Critics, including reporters' associations, argue the new policy could infringe on First Amendment rights by requiring formal authorization to publish certain unclassified information. This departure marks a significant shift in media access, ending an era where a constant press presence allowed for deep relationship-building and direct reporting from within the Defense Department.</p>

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the federal agency responsible for maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, is preparing to furlough about 80% of its employees. This drastic measure is due to the depletion of its operational funds during the extended government shutdown. Lawmakers have voiced alarm, warning that the staff reduction poses a significant risk to a vital component of national security, though the agency plans to keep a skeleton crew for essential safety and protection functions.</p>

          <p>For individuals with delinquent credit card debt, creditors can pursue a court judgment to legally garnish wages, a process where a portion of one's paycheck is withheld. Federal law establishes a maximum limit for this garnishment, typically capping it at 25% of a person's disposable income. However, the article notes that many states have implemented their own, often stricter, regulations that provide greater protection for borrowers.

          <p>Residents of Gloster, a small, predominantly Black town in Mississippi, have filed a lawsuit against Drax Biomass after the UK-owned company was granted a permit to increase its hazardous air pollution. The lawsuit claims the wood pellet production plant, which fuels a power station in England, has already caused significant health problems in the community. The permit was approved despite the facility's history of emissions violations, intensifying an environmental justice battle with international dimensions.</p>

          <p>While overdose deaths have been declining nationally, Alaska is experiencing a renewed surge, highlighting the state's unique challenges with its remote geography and the fentanyl crisis. In communities like the Matanuska-Susitna borough, people who use drugs are forming vital support networks to keep each other alive, primarily by administering the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. These grassroots harm reduction efforts are a critical lifeline in a state where formal healthcare can be inaccessible and isolation is common.</p>

          <p>The new Netflix documentary "The Perfect Neighbor" investigates the 2023 killing of Ajike Owens, a Black mother of four, by her white neighbor, Susan Lorincz, in Ocala, Florida.

The documentary serves as a powerful indictment of "Stand Your Ground" laws, exploring how they can be weaponized when claims of self-defense are filtered through racial bias.</p>

Key figures include former National Security Advisor John Bolton, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former FBI Director James Comey, all of whom were recently charged with various offenses. The actions are described by critics as a coordinated campaign of political retribution aimed at punishing those perceived as enemies of the administration.</p>

          <p>Despite its NASCAR broadcasts on Prime Video showing lower viewership numbers compared to traditional television, Amazon considers its first season a success by a different metric. An Amazon broadcast team member explained that if their streaming coverage inspires a viewer to attend a race in person, they count it as a victory, even if it means one less person is watching online. This unique perspective aligns with a recent trend of sold-out crowds at several major NASCAR events, suggesting the strategy is positively impacting live engagement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted federal funding for two critical New York infrastructure projects, the Gateway rail tunnel and the Second Avenue Subway, in a move widely seen as political pressure on the state's Democratic leaders.

          <p>In a high-profile case that has gripped France, a court has convicted Cédric Jubillar of murdering his wife, Delphine, sentencing him to 30 years in prison. The verdict was reached despite the fact that Delphine's body has never been found since her disappearance in 2020. Prosecutors successfully argued that a wealth of circumstantial evidence—including a neighbor hearing screams and the couple's impending divorce—was sufficient to prove his guilt, overcoming the defense's argument that no crime could be certain without a body.</p>
