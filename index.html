            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a "challenging scenario" of accelerating inflation and a slowing economy. Powell reiterated that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and will likely cause higher inflation and slower growth. While the Fed is prepared to be patient, some members are split on how to respond, with some focusing on inflation and others on potential recession risks. Recent reports indicate a solid economy, but consumer and business confidence have declined, raising concerns about future spending. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, owner of Simplified, a stationery business in Florida, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs on goods imported from China. Ley argues that the tariffs, which have cost her business nearly $1.2 million since Trump's first term, were imposed without Congressional approval, denying her and other voters representation. She fears the tariffs will force her to raise prices significantly, making her products unaffordable, and may lead to job losses. Ley emphasizes that small businesses lack the resources to adapt to such drastic changes, unlike larger corporations.</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has threatened to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for allegedly defying an order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison. Boasberg stated the government "deliberately flouted" his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The administration has used this law to deport alleged gang members to El Salvador, but many had no criminal records. Boasberg has given the government an opportunity to rectify the situation or face potential criminal charges and the appointment of a private attorney to prosecute the case.</p>

            <p>In response to tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, China is promoting domestic tourism among its retirees to boost internal consumption and offset potential export revenue losses. The "silver train" initiative encourages older citizens with savings to travel to less developed regions of the country, providing a financial boost to struggling local economies. Special trains are designed to cater to elderly travelers, offering comfortable access, medical support, and assistance.

            <p>A recent CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children, or over 3%, have been identified with autism, a significant increase from previous years. While improved screening and access to services may contribute to the rise in diagnoses, there also appears to be an underlying increase. The study found higher prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to factors like preterm birth and lead poisoning. The CDC has faced communication challenges amid administration restructuring and spending cuts into autism research have surged, largely focusing on the biology of the condition.</p>

            <p>Chinese carmakers like BYD and Geely are facing delays in their plans to establish overseas production facilities due to concerns from Beijing over trade and geopolitical risks. Approvals for production plants in Brazil and Mexico have been put on hold as Chinese officials urge a more cautious approach to global expansion. Beijing is encouraging carmakers to strategically select destinations that are more favorable towards China. This intervention reflects a broader trend of China influencing EV investments based on geopolitical considerations.</p>

            <p>Latinas are at a higher risk of breast cancer mortality due to a combination of factors, including a higher prevalence of dense breasts and lower rates of early screening. Dense breast tissue can obscure cancerous tissue on mammograms, leading to later diagnoses. Cultural, systemic, and environmental factors contribute to the disparities in screening rates. Organizations are working to increase awareness, advocate for legislation requiring notification of breast density, and address barriers to healthcare access within the Latino community. Increased research is needed.</p>

            <p>MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an election denier, tearfully told a judge he is financially ruined and unable to pay court-ordered sanctions to Smartmatic, a voting software company.

He stated that he has laid off hundreds of employees, lost warehouse units, and owes millions to the IRS.

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing a rule to redefine "harm" under the Endangered Species Act, limiting it to direct actions that kill or injure protected species. This change would remove the prohibition against habitat destruction that leads to those ends. Conservationists argue that this move would significantly curtail the act's reach and harm vulnerable plants and animals. The proposed change has triggered a 30-day public comment period and could face legal challenges.</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is advising consumer-oriented companies to cut prices, even with new tariffs squeezing their margins. He argues that consumers are already resistant to high prices and that companies need to lower prices to maintain sales. He pointed to recent earnings reports from luxury goods company LVMH as evidence that consumers are cutting back on spending. Cramer suggested that mergers could be an alternative to gross margin decline, as they create cost-cutting opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

This discovery suggests the planet may be teeming with microbial life. Further analysis and review of the data is needed before any claims can be substantiated.</p>

            <p>Nikku Madhusudhan from the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy called his team's new findings "astounding", as the team found an ocean world that's teeming with microbes is currently the best explanation for some chemical signatures that the James Webb Space Telescope has spotted in the atmosphere of a distant planet. The purportedly tell-tale gases that appear to be in this planet's atmosphere are either dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, or some combination of the two. On Earth, these are only produced by life, particularly by marine microbes. This is a harbinger of future claims about possible signs of life beyond our solar system that should become increasingly common.</p>
