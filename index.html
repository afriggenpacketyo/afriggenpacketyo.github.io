          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at the United Nations General Assembly was marked by a walkout from many delegates, reflecting Israel's growing international isolation. His address, which he vowed would condemn nations supporting a Palestinian state, was broadcast towards Gaza via loudspeakers. The visit to New York also drew protests from families of hostages held in Gaza, and occurred amid heightened tensions with global bodies like the ICC, which has issued an arrest warrant for him.</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, held steady at a 2.9% annual rate in August, aligning with economists' expectations. The headline inflation rate saw a minor increase to 2.7%, while personal income and spending both rose slightly more than anticipated. These figures suggest that inflation is not accelerating unexpectedly, likely keeping the central bank on track to consider further interest rate reductions later in the year.

          <p>Actor Jason Bateman reflects on his difficult transition from a child star to an adult actor, revealing that his career nearly ended in his 20s due to a hard-partying lifestyle. He explains that after years of working intensely from a young age, he felt a need to "catch up" on missed experiences, which led him away from the industry and made his return a humbling struggle. Bateman credits his wife Amanda Anka's ultimatum and landing the role in "Arrested Development" with revitalizing his career and helping him achieve sobriety and later success as both an actor and director.</p>

          <p>A Chinese start-up has successfully launched the S1500, the world's most powerful flying wind turbine, during a test flight in the Xinjiang region. The massive airship-like device, the size of a basketball court, generated one megawatt of power while floating high in the sky. This innovative technology captures wind energy at higher altitudes where winds are stronger and more consistent, delivering electricity back to the ground through reinforced cables, with mass production planned for 2026.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve lowering its benchmark rate, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are remaining stubbornly high, currently hovering above 6%. This article explains that these rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury bond yield than the Fed's rate, and a wider-than-usual gap, or "spread," between them is keeping costs elevated. Factors contributing to this wide spread include persistent inflation concerns and the Federal Reserve's reduced purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, which has decreased demand and driven up yields.

          <p>This article examines the role of American marketing and public relations firms, such as Stagwell Global, in helping Israel manage its global image amid accusations of genocide in Gaza. It reports that Israel's foreign ministry commissioned a campaign to reframe the narrative by stoking fears of "Radical Islam," with one strategy being to "flood the zone" with pro-Israel messaging on social media, potentially using bots. The author argues that these well-funded propaganda efforts, combined with restricted journalistic access to Gaza, aim to create uncertainty and obscure the reality of the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Government Data Shows Immigrants with No Criminal Record Are Now the Largest Group in ICE Custody</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reveals a significant shift in detention demographics, with immigrants having no criminal record now constituting the largest single group of those arrested and held by the agency. This development contradicts the administration's narrative that its enforcement actions primarily target dangerous criminals. The trend reflects a surge in so-called "collateral arrests" as ICE has been directed to dramatically increase its daily arrest numbers, leading to more detentions of individuals who have lived in the U.S. for years without any criminal history.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched two trade investigations against Mexico, one targeting pecans and another examining broader trade barriers, in a move analysts interpret as a "clear warning." The action follows Mexico's recent decision to impose duties on a range of imported goods from various countries, a policy widely seen as an effort to align with Washington's trade priorities. Beijing's probes signal that it will not hesitate to take retaliatory action if it perceives that its trading partners are bowing to pressure from the United States.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author describes the challenges of being married to a man who is her polar opposite in both politics and sports allegiances—she is a liberal Yankees fan, while he is a MAGA-supporting Dodgers fan. She reflects on how they navigate these fundamental disagreements, often by avoiding political discussions altogether on the advice of their marriage counselor. Ultimately, she concludes that despite the friction, their relationship endures because of shared humor and his deep acts of kindness, which form the foundation of their connection beyond divisive external issues.</p>
