          <p>More than 300 South Korean nationals, detained in a major ICE raid at a Hyundai-LG battery facility in Georgia, have been released and are being flown back to their country. The workers were accused of visa violations, including overstaying permits or holding visas that did not allow for manual labor. The incident, the largest single-site enforcement action in ICE history, has strained diplomatic and economic relations between the U.S. and South Korea, a top foreign investor. U.S. officials have reiterated that foreign investment is welcome, but must be done legally.</p>

          <p>Emily Thornberry has withdrawn from the race to become the next deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, citing insufficient nominations from fellow Members of Parliament. Her exit leaves four candidates competing to replace Angela Rayner, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently the frontrunner. The contest requires candidates to secure 80 MP nominations to proceed to the next stage. The ongoing race is seen by some as a potential distraction for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's government.</p>

          <p>Attendees at a Utah Valley University event have described the chaos and panic that erupted after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a single loud bang before seeing Kirk fall, which triggered a mass scramble for safety as people dropped to the ground or fled to nearby buildings. Several attendees, including a former congressman, recounted the traumatic experience of witnessing the shooting. Some also expressed surprise at what they perceived as a lack of stringent security measures at the large public gathering.</p>

          <h2>Pharmaceutical Giant Merck Halts £1 Billion UK Expansion Citing Lack of Government Investment</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US pharmaceutical company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, is canceling a planned £1 billion expansion in the UK, which includes a major research center in London. The company attributed the decision to successive UK governments undervaluing innovative medicines and a lack of investment in the life sciences sector. This move, which will result in 125 job losses, follows similar decisions by other major drug companies like AstraZeneca. Industry experts warn this could signal a broader trend of pharmaceutical disinvestment from the UK.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index achieved a new record high, driven by optimism over potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and a significant surge in SoftBank Group's stock. SoftBank's shares jumped over 10% following a report of a major cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, as SoftBank is linked to both through the "Stargate" AI initiative. While the Nikkei saw strong gains, other Asian markets had mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi also reaching a record high while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell slightly.

          <p>This opinion article explores the starkly different reactions among Donald Trump's supporters to his association with Jeffrey Epstein versus other allegations of sexual misconduct, such as the E. Jean Carroll case. The author argues that the intense outrage over Epstein's crimes, which involved child victims, serves as a moral counterweight for a movement that is otherwise indifferent to or dismissive of other forms of misogyny and abuse allegations against Trump. The article suggests this selective outrage is rooted in a sentimentalized defense of "fallen girls" while simultaneously rejecting modern, independent women who challenge traditional gender roles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil, a move aimed at further pressuring Russia's war economy. However, European officials are seen as unlikely to agree, given their own complex trade relationships and a general aversion to using tariffs as a primary policy tool. Analysts suggest the request may be an attempt by the U.S. to shift responsibility for a stronger economic response to Europe. The EU has struggled to fully wean itself off Russian energy, making it difficult to penalize other nations for similar trade.</p>

Eyewitnesses reported that a single shot was fired from a distance, striking Kirk in the neck as he was addressing a crowd of approximately 3,000 people. The incident caused widespread panic, and the university campus was evacuated as a massive manhunt for the shooter began. Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump, was known for his campus tours where he engaged in open debates on political issues.</p>

          <p>Stock markets around the world, including the S&P 500 in the U.S. and Japan's Nikkei 225, have been reaching record highs in a broad-based rally. Investor sentiment has been buoyed by resilient corporate earnings, signs of cooling inflation, and growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates soon. A surprisingly weak U.S. producer price index reading further fueled optimism for a policy shift from the Fed. Analysts note that this positive environment is providing a "tonic for risk investors," driving capital into equities globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the relationship between the United States and Europe is facing a structural, long-term rupture that will persist even after Donald Trump's presidency. The author suggests that underlying demographic, economic, and security trends in the U.S. mean the era of a transatlantic alliance based on shared values is over. The article posits that Europe must emotionally and strategically accept this new reality. It warns European leaders against self-humiliation and concessions, urging them instead to pursue strategic autonomy to avoid being treated as a colony in a new world of competing empires.</p>

          <p>Following his assassination, Charlie Kirk is being remembered as one of the most influential figures in conservative politics and a pivotal force in the MAGA movement. As the founder of Turning Point USA, the 31-year-old built a powerful youth organization that reshaped conservative outreach on college campuses and online. He was a close friend and ally to President Trump and his family, credited with mobilizing young voters and shaping the political discourse on issues like critical race theory. His death has sent shockwaves through the White House and the broader conservative movement, where he was seen as a vital leader.</p>

          <p>South Korea's national intelligence agency believes that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is further establishing his daughter, Kim Ju Ae, as his likely successor. This assessment comes after she recently accompanied him on a visit to China, which the agency views as an opportunity for her to gain overseas experience and build her profile as the heir apparent. Although she was kept out of the public eye during the trip, her inclusion is seen as a significant step in the succession process. The agency also noted that North Korean officials took measures to protect the biological information of Kim and his daughter during the visit.</p>

In recent months, Prince Harry has publicly expressed a desire to reconcile, and the meeting's arrangement was kept confidential by both sides, suggesting a new level of cooperation. While a full family reconciliation, particularly with his brother Prince William, appears distant, the meeting itself is seen as a positive development.</p>

An attendee who was near the front said Kirk had just begun to address a question on the subject when the single gunshot was heard. The event was part of Kirk's "Prove Me Wrong" campus tour, where he invites students to challenge his views.

The lawsuit alleges that the firings were part of a broader purge to punish agents for doing their jobs, particularly those involved in the January 6th investigation, thereby putting national security at risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A real estate analysis by Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a "normal" level, defined as the mortgage payment-to-income ratio from July 2018. This normalization is due to a combination of slowing home-price growth and rapidly rising wages for high-earning tech workers in the city. While this indicates a return to a pre-pandemic equilibrium, it does not mean the city has become affordable, as San Francisco households still spend a much larger share of their income on housing than the national average. The trend also does not reflect the reality for renters, who face rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>
