          <p>Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, discussed the ongoing conflict with Russia and the importance of the U.S.-Ukraine partnership. She highlighted a recent economic partnership agreement between the two nations, aimed at creating an investment fund to benefit both countries, despite Russia's criticism and continued occupation of eastern Ukraine. The ambassador emphasized Ukraine's commitment to peace and the potential for the U.S. to have a specific economic interest in Ukraine's resources, such as agricultural land and critical minerals. The deal is expected to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament soon and will count future U.S. military assistance as a contribution to the investment fund.</p>

          <p>Brazilian Civil Police arrested two suspects in connection with an alleged bomb plot targeting Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The suspects, reportedly Lady Gaga fans, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives, including Molotov cocktails, though no explosives were found during the operation. Authorities say the two are part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, with one suspect also found in possession of child pornography. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans.</p>

The phrase is often a symptom of deeper dysfunction, such as fear of openly expressing needs. Clear communication and acceptance are crucial for a thriving relationship.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ health, impacting research on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affecting this population. Officials justified the cuts by stating that the research "no longer effectuates agency priorities" and was based on "unscientific" categories. The cuts have led to job losses and the termination of clinical trials, with scientists warning of potential harm to LGBTQ individuals and a resurgence of diseases like HIV. Critics argue the administration's actions reflect ideological bias and create a hierarchy of patients, while the NIH defends its move as restoring evidence-based science.</p>

The sketch showcased stylish yet comfortable clothing for women who are "stylish but tired," capturing the realities of navigating life in their 30s. Unlike previous parodies, the sketch did not mock the clothing or the women wearing them, but rather highlighted the relatable experience of prioritizing comfort and practicality. The humor came from the relatable experiences of millennial women who have lived through multiple culture-shocking events and are more focused on comfort than trends.</p>

          <p>With America facing a shortage of millions of homes, innovative solutions are emerging to address the affordable housing crisis. One approach involves retrofitting single-family homes into multi-unit dwellings, like "roommate houses," to maximize existing housing stock, while another involves building backyard cottages. California's ADU laws have spurred an entrepreneurial boom, and companies are helping homeowners subdivide lots. These strategies aim to add housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption, offering a way to increase housing density without constructing large apartment complexes.</p>

          <p>Marvel and Disney's latest release, "Thunderbolts*," has proven a hit at the box office, earning an estimated $162 million internationally. The film, based around lesser-known superheroes, has received mixed reviews from critics but a high audience score. Some critics note that the film is the best thing to come from Marvel since WandaVision, but that the topics covered, including suicide, depression and domestic violence are "not always sensitively handled", while others praise the film as "the best Marvel movie in years". The film's success is potentially due to audience fatigue with main Marvel Cinematic Universe characters.</p>
