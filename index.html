          <p>A federal judge is demanding answers after a two-year-old U.S. citizen may have been deported to Honduras alongside her mother and sister. Judge Terry Doughty expressed "strong suspicion" that the government deported the child without due process. The judge scheduled a hearing for May 16 to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deportation, which occurred after the family attended a routine check-in with ICE. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the parent chose to take the child to Honduras. Optimism regarding the situation is low due to the potential violation of citizenship rights.</p>

          <p>Recent polls suggest that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump across several key issues. Surveys reveal concerns about the economy, immigration policies, and the president's priorities. A significant portion of voters disapprove of Trump's performance, with independents expressing particularly strong doubts. The polls also indicate unease regarding Trump's approach to foreign policy and trade negotiations. These negative reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, reflecting potential fatigue among the electorate.</p>

          <p>Amid the Pope's funeral at the Vatican, Donald Trump expressed a changed perspective on Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine. Trump questioned Putin's willingness to end the war, suggesting that the Russian leader may not be serious about negotiations. This shift in Trump's view could potentially offer new hope for intervention in the conflict. The comments followed a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican, which Zelenskyy described as a "very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic."</p>

Scientists warn that the road will increase the risk of wildfires, endangering the tree and the surrounding ecosystem.

Researchers are working to unlock the secrets stored in the Gran Abuelo and other trees — information that could shape how we understand and fight climate change.

          <p>The FBI's arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has ignited a political firestorm, with Republicans calling for her removal and Democrats decrying the action as an overreach of executive power. Dugan was arrested for allegedly helping a man evade immigration officers at her courthouse. Republicans accuse her of obstructing law enforcement, while Democrats argue that the arrest reflects the Trump administration's disregard for judicial independence. The incident has intensified the debate over immigration enforcement and the role of the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett suggests that moving U.S. iPhone assembly to India may not effectively reduce costs associated with tariffs. He argues that since iPhone components would still be manufactured in China, tariffs would remain a significant factor. Moffett also notes potential challenges in diversifying to India and anticipates a backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs. He believes that Apple's supply chain would still be anchored in China and would likely face resistance. (not investment advice)</p>
