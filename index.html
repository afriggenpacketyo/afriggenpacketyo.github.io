          <p>Circle's stock price continued its upward trajectory on Friday, driven by investor enthusiasm for the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act, a proposed stablecoin legislation. The stock experienced a significant increase, adding to gains made earlier in the week after the bill's passage. The GENIUS Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, which have gained traction due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments. Coinbase shares also rose, benefiting from revenue generated from Circle's USDC reserves, and the bill would add substantial consumer protections, collateral requirements, and regulatory oversight. </p>

          <p>President Trump's consideration of involving the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran has sparked division within the Republican Party, pitting traditional hawks against anti-interventionist voices. Trump stated he will decide on escalations within two weeks, prompting criticism from some supporters who accuse him of backtracking on his anti-war stance. Some Republicans are attempting to prevent military action through legislative means, while others, like Senator Lindsey Graham, support U.S. involvement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon believes Trump's base will support his decision either way, highlighting the complex dynamics within the party regarding foreign policy. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, determining that he is not a threat to the community or a flight risk. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained by immigration agents in March, and his attorneys argued that his detention was "highly unusual." The White House announced that the administration would appeal the decision, and the Department of Homeland Security criticized the order, claiming it undermines national security. The judge stated that there was an effort to use the immigration charge to punish the petitioner for his anti-Israel speech, highlighting the controversy surrounding Khalil's detention. </p>

Araghchi stated that Iran is open to dialogue but has "nothing to discuss" with the United States as long as Israel continues its strikes.

High mortgage rates and low inventory of affordable homes have squeezed many Americans out of the housing market. Redfin suggests that sellers may be willing to negotiate on price due to high housing costs and economic uncertainty, however homes in desirable locations that are in perfect condition are still hot and typically sell at or above asking price.</p>

The court did not rule on the suit itself but he said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state’s rule. The suit argued that California and the EPA were abusing their power by relying on a 1970s-era rule for fighting smog as a means of combating climate change. This decision follows actions by President Trump and congressional Republicans to disapprove regulations that would have allowed California to enforce broad new regulations for "zero emissions" vehicles. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to receive transportation funding. The judge ruled that the administration lacks the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The policy was deemed "arbitrary and capricious" and lacking specificity in how states are to cooperate on immigration enforcement. The Trump administration has threatened to cut off some federal funding to "sanctuary" jurisdictions, arguing that these policies hinder ICE's ability to apprehend undocumented immigrants. </p>

Savers should consider their individual needs and risk tolerance when choosing between these two options, as both offer similar interest-earning potential. (not investment advice)</p>
