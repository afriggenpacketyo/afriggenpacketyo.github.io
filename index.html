          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's approach to Iran, emphasizing Trump's consistent stance against Iranian nuclear weapons development. Vance highlighted Trump's openness to a deal preventing uranium enrichment and alluded to potential further actions if Iran violates non-proliferation obligations. His comments come amidst growing divisions among Trump's supporters, including Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, regarding U.S. involvement in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Vance assured that Trump is focused on using the American military solely to achieve American goals. The article underscores the administration's commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons amid internal and external pressures.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions, speculation arises regarding the potential use of the U.S.'s GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, known as the bunker buster, against Iran's Fordo nuclear facility. This facility, believed to house Iran's uranium enrichment program, is located deep within a mountain. The GBU-57 is a 20-foot long, 30,000-pound bomb capable of penetrating 200 feet into a target before exploding. While the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is capable of carrying two of these bombs, the potential use of the weapon raises concerns about nuclear contamination and regional stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked-choice voting in its mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If a candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, they win outright; otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the second-choice votes from their ballots are then allocated. This process continues until two candidates remain, with the leading candidate declared the winner. The system has led to unique alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a specific candidate, like former Governor Andrew Cuomo, from winning. This is the second time New York City has used ranked-choice voting citywide.</p>

          <p>The NAACP has decided not to invite President Trump to its national convention, breaking a 116-year tradition of welcoming the sitting U.S. president. NAACP President Derrick Johnson cited Trump's attacks on democracy and civil rights as the reason for the decision. The White House responded sharply, accusing the NAACP of promoting hate and division, while the NAACP has filed civil rights lawsuits against the Trump administration. Historically, presidents have used the NAACP convention to build ties with the Black community, but the organization feels Trump's policies conflict with its mission of equity and inclusion.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days. This marks the third delay since his inauguration, as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, remains elusive. The administration is reportedly working to ensure a deal is closed, allowing Americans to continue using TikTok with data security assurances. Despite Congress's concerns about TikTok serving as a vessel for Chinese espionage and propaganda, there has been little action to enforce the law.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering joining Israel's efforts to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, including the underground site at Fordo, sources told CBS News. The issue was discussed in a meeting with Trump's national security team, but there is not full agreement among his advisors on how to proceed. Trump has stated that the U.S. now has complete and total control of the skies over Iran and issued a warning of "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!" This consideration comes amid allegations that Iran is making swift progress toward building nuclear weapons, though earlier assessments suggested otherwise.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to regulate the $250 billion stablecoin market, with a 68 to 30 vote. The bill establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000 and includes stronger bankruptcy protections. The bill experienced hurdles due to concerns about President Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere, leading to bipartisan negotiations and changes to safeguard against corruption. While some Democrats remain concerned, the bill's supporters argue it is a long-overdue measure that will protect consumers and provide regulatory clarity for businesses (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party appears to be struggling to capitalize on widespread opposition to Donald Trump, with internal divisions and a lack of clear leadership. While Americans participated in large-scale protests against Trump, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) faced internal conflicts and some leaders attended a high-profile wedding. The party is consumed with relitigating past events rather than focusing on the future, and lacks a unifying figure, however, the article mentions that there is still time for the Democratic party to get their act together before the midterms and the 2028 election.</p>

The Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of politicizing economic and technological issues, rejecting claims that Huawei's equipment poses a national security threat. This response follows the U.S. embassy in Panama's announcement of an $8 million initiative to replace Huawei equipment with "secure American technology" at 13 sites.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has warned staff that artificial intelligence will lead to a smaller corporate workforce in the coming years. In a memo to employees, Jassy urged them to embrace AI, expecting it to lead to "efficiency gains" that would allow the firm to reduce its corporate workforce. This announcement aligns with a broader trend of companies investing heavily in AI, raising concerns about potential job losses, particularly in entry-level office roles. Jassy emphasized that while some jobs will be eliminated, new roles will emerge, although the net effect is expected to be a reduction in Amazon's total corporate workforce.</p>
