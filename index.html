        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports indicate that Iran launched a missile strike on the Al-Udeid U.S. military base in Qatar, with explosions heard near Doha. Qatar's air defenses reportedly intercepted the missiles, and the Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, reserving the right to respond. The U.S. Embassy in Qatar had issued a shelter-in-place advisory, and Qatar temporarily closed its airspace, as the White House and Department of Defense monitored the situation. The attack follows recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities amid escalating tensions between Iran and its allies and the United States and its allies. The article emphasizes that Qatar had issued security procedures beforehand, and there were no casualties. Optimism here is relatively low considering the geopolitical instability in this situation.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the EU is attempting to reassert its role in de-escalating the conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite being sidelined by the U.S., EU leaders believe they can facilitate negotiations due to their experience with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The EU is concerned about the potential impact of the conflict on European energy security, particularly the possibility of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz. EU leaders are urging Iran to engage in credible diplomatic solutions and avoid further destabilizing actions. The situation is tense, but the EU is trying to foster diplomatic solutions to avoid further escalation.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong rebound in the tech sector following an early selloff, Apple's stock has underperformed compared to other major tech companies. Investors are still putting money into tech through broad market ETFs, but some are diversifying into more traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Analysts suggest that geopolitical events present buying opportunities in tech, particularly in AI-related stocks. Investors are becoming more accustomed to market volatility, and while large-cap tech is seen as a safe haven, diversification is key. (not investment advice)</p>

While Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates, the FOMC voted to hold rates steady at its last meeting. The article gives the impression that an interest rate cut could be possible.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, alleging that Zillow is using "monopoly tactics" by banning private home listings. Compass claims that Zillow's policy restricts homeowners from marketing their properties off Zillow for more than one day, preventing them from listing on Zillow and its allies' platforms. Compass seeks an injunction to prohibit Zillow from enforcing this policy and is demanding a jury trial and unspecified damages. Zillow denies the claims and intends to defend against the lawsuit. The article highlights the increasing competition in the housing market.</p>

          <p>Sina Toossi argues that the joint US-Israeli strikes on Iran reflect a flawed approach based on pressure, coercion, and destabilization. Toossi contends that the strikes are a desperate attempt to change the regime in Iran and prop up Israeli dominance. The author suggests that Iran's nuclear infrastructure is designed to withstand such attacks, and military escalation risks pushing Iran closer to weaponization. The author proposes a reassessment of US policy, prioritizing regional equilibrium over unconditional support for Israel. The author is critical of the current strategy.</p>
