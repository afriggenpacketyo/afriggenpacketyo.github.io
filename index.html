          <p>Oil prices surged following reports of escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, particularly after the U.S. joined the conflict. Experts warn of potential supply disruptions, possibly exceeding those seen during the Ukraine war, which could drive prices to $100 per barrel. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade, is a key concern, as threats of its closure by Iran could lead to Western intervention and further price spikes. Industry analysts suggest that even harassment of passage through the Strait could significantly increase oil prices, leading to unprecedented volatility in the market. Optimism is tempered by the high stakes involved in a potential disruption to global oil supplies. </p>

The Thunder's victory marks the culmination of a rebuild, bringing the NBA title to Oklahoma City for the first time. The Pacers struggled after losing Tyrese Haliburton to a leg injury early in the game, and the Thunder capitalized with a dominant performance, especially in the third quarter, making them the youngest team to win a title in nearly a half-century. </p>

          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris after staff became suspicious that the "bride" was a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man reportedly hired the park for €130,000 and brought in hundreds of extras to act as guests. The girl's mother claimed the event was to make her daughter feel like a Disney princess for a day. Four people, including the alleged "groom," the girl's mother, and two Latvian nationals, have been taken into custody as authorities investigate the circumstances of the incident, while a medical examination showed that the girl had not suffered any violence. </p>

          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, a devastating World War II ground battle between Japan and the United States. The battle claimed the lives of over 200,000 military personnel and residents, with one in four Okinawan residents killed. The service was held at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, where the final stage of the battle occurred, and 342 names were added to the list of war dead inscribed on monuments. Anti-base sentiment remains strong due to noise, pollution, and crimes by American service members, and Japan has been strengthening its defense capabilities in the prefecture amid rising tensions with China, raising concerns among Okinawans about becoming a conflict front line again. </p>

          <p>Senior officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted conference calls with governors and law enforcement officials to discuss the U.S. missile strikes in Iran and their impact on the threat environment. The FBI stated it would enhance its posture, increasing personnel presence and intelligence monitoring. Officials urged vigilance for increased cyber activity and potential threats to Jewish institutions and groups associated with Israel. While there is no specific intelligence of a direct, credible threat against the U.S. homeland, the DHS noted that the U.S. strike against Iran raises the threat environment within the country. </p>

The original post stated that the department was closely monitoring the situation with local, state, and federal partners. Stop Antisemitism criticized the post, pointing out that there were no victims in the strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The U.S. military carried out strikes targeting nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan in Operation Midnight Hammer, which the Trump administration described as a success in degrading Tehran's nuclear weapon capabilities. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Judge Barbara Holmes stated that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, but acknowledged he would likely remain in custody due to an ICE detainer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S., while the defense claims the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case. </p>

The strikes targeted nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, utilizing Tomahawk cruise missiles and GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites, and the U.S. warned Iran against retaliation.

Trump deemed the bombing of Iranian nuclear sites a "spectacular military success," claiming Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated." These statements come after Trump campaigned on the promise of "no more wars," but his views have shifted due to global events.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is drawing renewed attention as Japan faces a potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With China in the midst of an escalating confrontation with the United States, experts believe Beijing may use panda loans to mend relations with Tokyo. Foreign affairs experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan, and China has long used pandas as a tool of diplomatic outreach. However, some analysts are skeptical that a new panda loan will have any tangible impact on the Japanese government's diplomatic posture toward China. </p>

Recommendations include adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports, incentives, and ways to disseminate information on these 'flaws' in AI systems, drawing from practices successfully adopted in software security. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia will likely be placed in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody due to an immigration detainer, despite a Tennessee judge ordering his release in his criminal case. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was mistakenly deported and later brought back to the U.S. to face charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants. Judge Barbara Holmes denied the government's motion to detain Abrego Garcia, but acknowledged that he would likely be detained by ICE pending further removal proceedings. Judge Holmes also stated that the government failed to prove there is a "serious risk" that Abrego Garcia will flee or obstruct justice. </p>

          <p>According to research on parent-child relationships, parents who have an easy time getting their children to listen avoid threats, bribes, or harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that encourages cooperation by honoring a child's autonomy while setting boundaries. Phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Alternative phrases that promote respect, emotional safety, and involvement can lead to better communication and cooperation, such as "I know you don't like this decision. I'll explain, and then we're moving forward" and "I see you're really upset. Tell me what's happening."</p>

Experts suggest that the "normalization of digital surveillance" is fueling concerning behaviors, as sharing locations and checking online activity are often seen as signs of love and care. The Suzy Lamplugh Trust reports that cyberstalking among under-16s remains under-researched and underfunded, and the College of Policing has urged for better tracking of online offenses. </p>

The strikes come after Iran pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, and the U.S. has warned Iran against retaliating. Defense Department officials confirmed that American B-2 Spirit bombers were used in the strikes, and the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency stated that it confirmed "no increase in off-site radiation levels."</p>

          <p>Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso says he has “zero tolerance” for racism after Antonio Rüdiger said he was a victim of abuse during their 3-1 win against Mexican side Pachuca at the Club World Cup on Sunday. Alonso said Rüdiger's claim is believed, and FIFA is investigating the incident. Jude Bellingham and Arda Güler scored late in the first half to help 10-man Real Madrid to a victory in a Group H clash played amid sweltering conditions on Sunday in Charlotte, North Carolina. </p>
