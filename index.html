          <p>A New York judge has ruled for the second time that the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport alleged gang members is unlawful, granting a preliminary injunction in the case of two Salvadoran plaintiffs. Judge Alvin Hellerstein stated that the AEA was not validly invoked and that the administration's claim of an 'invasion' by Tren de Aragua gang members lacks justification. The judge emphasized that the plaintiffs were not given adequate notice or due process to challenge their removal, setting a hearing for May 21. This ruling follows a similar decision by a Texas judge, further challenging the administration's deportation strategy. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Tesla's vehicle sales have significantly dropped in key European markets like Germany and Britain, reaching their lowest point in over two years, despite overall growing demand for electric vehicles. Experts attribute this decline to increasing competition from European and Chinese automakers, as well as backlash against Elon Musk's political stances and President Trumpâ€™s tariffs. Chinese electric vehicle brands, such as BYD, have seen substantial sales increases in Europe, while Germany's Volkswagen is experiencing a recovery with its electric vehicle offerings.

          <p>Newark Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to an ongoing air traffic controller shortage and recent equipment failures, leading to trauma leave for some controllers. An equipment issue caused controllers to temporarily lose radar and communication with planes, prompting calls for trauma leave. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system to address these issues, while Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding an investigation.

She claims Harris is untrustworthy and inauthentic, especially concerning events during the Biden administration.

          <p>Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's tenth chancellor after requiring a second vote to secure a majority in the Bundestag, marking a historic moment in German politics. Merz, a 69-year-old commercial lawyer with no prior top-level government experience, will lead a coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Known as a "trans-atlanticist and friend of Europe," Merz has been outspoken on issues such as military aid to Ukraine and has emphasized the importance of adhering to Germany's debt brake. His election comes amidst significant political upheaval in Germany and pressure from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Optimism score: 55</p>
