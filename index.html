          <p>Kristian White, an Australian police officer, received a two-year community corrections order and 425 hours of community service for fatally tasering 95-year-old Clare Nowland.  The judge deemed a jail sentence unnecessary given White's loss of employment and community standing, and the difficulty a former officer would face in prison.  The sentence sparked outrage from Nowland's family and the public, highlighting concerns about police use of force against vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts will lead to increased auto insurance premiums.  Higher repair costs due to more expensive parts will drive up insurance rates. This underscores the broader economic consequences of the tariffs beyond the direct impact on vehicle prices.  The Insurance Information Institute already forecast 7% premium increases before the tariffs were announced.</p>
