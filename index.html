          <p>Poland is holding a presidential runoff election featuring pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and conservative nationalist Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice party.

A second bridge collapsed in the Kursk region, causing a freight train to catch fire and injuring the driver, further raising concerns about infrastructure integrity in the area.

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£6bn in national security, according to Defence Secretary John Healey, with a strategic defense review expected to highlight the immediate danger posed by Russia and China. This review will include building new defense factories and creating 1,800 jobs across the UK to boost munitions production. The investment is intended to strengthen the armed forces and the industrial base, sending a message to Moscow about Britain's readiness to deter future conflicts.

          <p>A palliative care physician reflects on the meaning of living fully in the face of death, drawing on experiences with patients facing terminal illnesses. The article contrasts clichÃ© bucket lists with the more profound and ordinary wishes that arise when people confront their mortality, such as reconciling with estranged family or fulfilling long-postponed personal goals. The author suggests that awareness of death can illuminate what truly matters in life, leading to a more authentic and meaningful existence. Ultimately, considered reflection on mortality nudges people toward a more complicated version of the ordinary, not novel permutations of extremes.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, supports the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older starting with the 2028 Los Angeles Games. World Skate implemented the limit in April due to increasing injuries among younger athletes attempting more difficult tricks. Despite the potential impact on Japan's medal prospects, head coach Daisuke Hayakawa believes it is a good decision to protect physically immature children. While domestic competitions may remain open to younger skaters, the focus shifts to supporting the development of older athletes aiming for the Olympics.</p>

Prison work is now non-mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law includes 24 programs tailored to inmates' age, characteristics, and other factors, such as programs for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues.</p>

This has left many women feeling that their efforts to improve the world have been in vain, and that there is an attempt to silence women's voices.

          <p>Legal action over a major lithium project in the Democratic Republic of Congo is on hold as the U.S. aims to counter China's dominance in critical minerals. Perth-based AVZ Minerals suspended its arbitration case following U.S. encouragement to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. The U.S. is backing KoBold Metals, funded by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZâ€™s stake and invest US$1 billion in the project, challenging China's Zijin Mining's control. This move signals Washingtonâ€™s efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo for the green energy transition.</p>
