          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for an indefinite period following controversial comments from its host regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During a monologue, Kimmel suggested the accused shooter was aligned with the MAGA movement, prompting significant backlash. The decision came after the FCC chairman suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk and Nexstar Media Group preemptively dropped the show from its affiliated stations.</p>

          <p>The University of California's governing board has approved requests from several campus police departments to acquire military-grade weapons and equipment, including thousands of rifle rounds, pepper-ball launchers, and drones. The move comes amid heightened scrutiny of campus policing following clashes with pro-Palestinian protesters in 2024. While the university states the equipment is for safety and replenishing training supplies, some faculty members have expressed concern that it will be used against students and staff.</p>
