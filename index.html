          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 04:08:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social media posts claiming Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a DW fact-check. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like renovations or low vendor revenue, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 markets are scheduled to open as planned. The viral claims originated from a discreditable article that used unsubstantiated information and AI-generated imagery to paint a bleak picture of the country. Rising security costs are a genuine concern for organizers, but this has not led to widespread cancellations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 04:04:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As winter approaches and daylight hours decrease, many in the UK, particularly in northern regions like Scotland, face challenges with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This recurring seasonal depression is linked to reduced sunlight and can cause low mood, anxiety, and fatigue. In response, a new project in Orkney is providing "Wintering Well" boxes through libraries, which include therapeutic lamps and activity guides to help residents cope. The initiative, led by the University of Glasgow, aims to shift psychological attitudes toward winter by encouraging outdoor activity and creating comforting indoor light environments.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumously released memoir, "Nobody's Girl," chronicles her sexual exploitation by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The book recounts her experiences being trafficked, including a sexual assault by an unnamed former prime minister, and describes non-criminal encounters with powerful men like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump in the context of her abusers' social circle. Giuffre details how she first met Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago, where she worked, and describes Epstein and Maxwell's relationships with influential figures. The memoir provides a harrowing account of the psychological manipulation and abuse she endured.</p>

          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to determine the successor to President Michael D. Higgins. Voters chose between two main contenders, independent candidate Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, although a third candidate who withdrew late remained on the ballot. Connolly, a sitting TD, is backed by several left-wing parties, while Humphreys is a former senior cabinet minister. Early indications suggest that voter turnout might be low, potentially failing to surpass the record low set in the 2018 election.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case remains a significant issue for President Donald Trump, with ongoing public and political pressure to release all related investigative files. Despite Trump's past friendship with Epstein in the 1990s, he has since tried to distance himself from the scandal. The recent posthumous publication of survivor Virginia Giuffre's memoir has intensified speculation about Epstein's network. According to the article, many of Trump's supporters appear unfazed by his connection to Epstein, often viewing the entire political establishment as corrupt and applying a different standard to the president.</p>

          <p>A large-scale police manhunt is in progress for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been jailed for sexually assaulting a teenage girl and a woman and was scheduled to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. The erroneous release has been described as "totally unacceptable" by political leaders, prompting an internal investigation by the Prison Service. The incident has raised serious concerns about systemic failures within the UK's prison system, with critics highlighting it as a symptom of a broader crisis.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R.

The US does not recognize Maduro's presidency and has accused him of leading a drug-trafficking organization, fueling fears in Venezuela that the military buildup is a precursor to a regime-change operation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' decisive 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series has sparked debate over whether a week-long break was a disadvantage. After sweeping their championship series, the Dodgers' layoff was their longest since spring training, and both their pitching and performance seemed out of sync. Historically, teams that sweep their league championship series have a poor record in the World Series against opponents who played a full series. While the team officially denies that the rest was a factor, the poor outing from their pitchers suggests that being "too fresh" may have disrupted their rhythm.</p>

The White House has dismissed the criticism, stating that private funding is preferable to using taxpayer money for the project.</p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver stated he was "deeply disturbed" by the recent arrests of Portland coach Chauncey Billups and Miami guard Terry Rozier on gambling-related charges. Silver emphasized that the integrity of the competition is paramount and that the indictments, which have shocked the league, were "very upsetting." Rozier is alleged to have conspired with associates to win bets based on his performance, while Billups faces charges related to participating in rigged poker games. The incidents have cast a shadow over the league's opening week and renewed concerns about the influence of sports betting.</p>

          <p>As the US government shutdown extends into its 25th day with no resolution in sight, the Pentagon has accepted a $130 million anonymous donation to help pay service members. President Trump revealed the donation came from "a friend," calling the act patriotic, as about two million troops risk missing their paychecks. Meanwhile, Congress remains at an impasse, with the House of Representatives canceling votes for the fifth consecutive week. Lawmakers have expressed frustration over the lack of progress, with some predicting the shutdown will continue into November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has departed for a five-day tour of Asia, where he will attend the ASEAN and APEC summits, even as the US government remains shut down back home. The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with a highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping scheduled to address the ongoing trade war. The tour is seen as a crucial moment for US foreign policy in the region. However, the timing is notable as many federal employees missed their first full paycheck due to the political stalemate in Washington.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City, providing a significant boost to the frontrunner's campaign just before early voting begins. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. The endorsement consolidates support for Mamdani within the Democratic party, contrasting with outgoing Mayor Eric Adams' recent endorsement of Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The move is seen as a key signal of party unity ahead of the general election.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted as a symbolic and carefully planned effort to reset strained diplomatic ties between the two countries. While major immediate breakthroughs are not expected, the visit itself marks a significant move toward improving the relationship. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time that was considered a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations and led to a free-trade agreement. The current diplomatic landscape is more complex, but the meeting signals a mutual interest in stabilizing the bilateral connection.</p>

          <p>The Latino population in the United States has nearly doubled since 2000, growing from 35.3 million to 68 million and now constituting one in five Americans, according to a new Pew Research Center report. This growth, which accounts for over half of the total US population increase in that period, has been driven by both immigration and native births. The report also highlights that US Latinos are the nation's youngest major ethnic group, with a median age of 31, and that a large majority (79%) are US citizens. California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations in the country.</p>
