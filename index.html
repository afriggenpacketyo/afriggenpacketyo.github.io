          <p>Hamas is currently consulting with other Palestinian factions before responding to a new ceasefire proposal presented by the United States. The plan reportedly involves a 60-day truce, a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. A key point of contention for Hamas is securing a guarantee that Israeli military operations will not resume after the ceasefire period. US President Trump has indicated he expects a decision from Hamas within a day, expressing hope for an end to the 20-month conflict.</p>

          <p>A British and a New Zealand tourist have been killed by an elephant while on a guided walking safari in Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. According to local police, the two women were trampled by a female elephant that was with its calf and charged at high speed. Efforts by tour guides to deter the animal were unsuccessful, and both women died at the scene. This incident follows other fatal elephant attacks on tourists in the country, prompting authorities to reiterate calls for extreme caution when observing wildlife.</p>

          <h2>Missouri Judge Reinstates Block on Numerous State Abortion Restrictions</h2>

          <p>A state judge in Missouri has once again blocked many of the state's restrictive abortion laws, including a near-total ban, a 72-hour waiting period, and various facility requirements. The ruling from a Jackson County judge argues that the restrictions likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion that was approved by voters last year. Planned Parenthood announced it will resume providing procedural abortions in the state, while the Missouri Attorney General's office has stated its intention to appeal the decision. The ruling marks the latest development in a prolonged legal battle over abortion access in Missouri.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, was subjected to a massive overnight aerial assault, with Russia launching a record 550 drones and 11 missiles. The attack, which wounded at least 23 people and caused widespread damage, occurred just hours after a phone call between US President Trump and Russian President Putin, in which Trump expressed disappointment over Putin's unwillingness to end the war. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned the strikes as a cynical demonstration of Russia's intent to continue the conflict. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia's Rostov region reportedly killed one person.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities and a subsequent ceasefire, analysis suggests the two nations are entering a period of prolonged standoff rather than moving toward peace. The article argues the strike's purpose was to deny Iran near-term nuclear weapon capabilities, a goal the CIA reportedly confirmed was successful, though some intelligence suggests the delay may be brief. With entrenched ideological opposition and regional proxy conflicts, the future relationship is likely to be defined by a "Cold War" of containment, deterrence, and covert operations, not diplomatic reconciliation. President Trump is set to hold talks with Iranian officials, but expectations for a breakthrough remain low.</p>

Cities like Salt Lake City have adopted the high-tech displays to reduce wildfire risks in drought conditions and to offer a quieter, more inclusive celebration for those with PTSD and for pets. While drone shows, which involve hundreds of synchronized, illuminated drones creating images in the sky, are gaining popularity, they are not without risks, and some communities are reverting to fireworks after public pushback. The industry is experiencing rapid growth, with demand currently outstripping the supply of available drone fleets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff attributes the U.S. dollar's significant decline, its worst start to a year in half a century, to President Trump's trade policies and fiscal strategy. Rogoff explains that actions like trade wars, threats of taxes on foreign investment, and a ballooning budget deficit are eroding investor confidence and making the U.S. seem less safe for investment. While a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exporters by making their goods cheaper, it also increases the cost of imports and reduces the value of remittances sent abroad. The current trend may signal a major inflection point for the dollar's long-standing dominance in the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that the bill, which adds trillions to the deficit, was supported by Republicans who abandoned their supposed principles under pressure from Trump. The legislation is described as morally grotesque, set to strip millions of health coverage, cut food aid, and defund green energy, all while delivering massive tax cuts to billionaires.

          <p>On the first anniversary of his government, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described his relationship with US President Donald Trump as good, stating it is "in the national interest" for them to connect. Starmer said that despite their political differences, they find common ground in their shared value of family. He revealed their first conversation was after the assassination attempt on Trump last year, and Trump later reciprocated with a personal call after Starmer's brother passed away. Starmer also addressed recent domestic political turmoil, stating he would always "carry the can" and take responsibility as a leader.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The regulator accused the firm of engaging in widespread market manipulation by using coordinated trades in stocks and futures to artificially influence the Nifty 50 index, thereby profiting from larger bets in the options market. SEBI's order described the behavior as egregious, particularly after a warning had been issued. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated it is committed to complying with all regulations.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced it will levy anti-dumping tariffs, ranging from 27.7% to 34.9%, on brandy imported from the European Union, effective Saturday. The ministry stated its investigation found that dumping of European brandy posed a material threat of injury to China's domestic industry. The move is seen by analysts as a response to the EU's own hardball stance on trade, coming just before a planned visit by China's foreign minister to Paris. This action escalates trade tensions ahead of a planned China-EU summit later in the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cross-party committee of UK Members of Parliament has found that the Home Office does not have adequate systems to know whether foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee report criticized the department for failing to analyze exit check data since the skilled worker visa route was introduced in 2020. The Home Office, which acknowledged inheriting a "broken immigration system," still relies on airline passenger records and has been accused of being slow to tackle the exploitation of workers on this visa route.</p>

This financial boost provides a beacon of hope for defense and space contractors, offering a long-term, large-scale project amid budget cuts at NASA.

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are being weaponized by the Trump administration, turning a "golden opportunity" into a potential disaster. The author argues that despite Trump's public support for the Games, his administration is using them to stoke nationalism and empower agencies like ICE, creating a climate of fear in a city with a large immigrant population. The pre-emptive designation of the Olympics as a National Special Security Event (NSSE) grants federal agencies wide latitude, raising concerns about secrecy, policing, and the impact on civil liberties in Los Angeles well before the Games begin.</p>

He warns that the government, run by a former human rights lawyer, is abusing its power and augmenting draconian Tory-era laws, creating an authoritarian environment where dissent is increasingly criminalized.</p>

          <p>Despite a Chinese state media editorial calling for tighter regulation of "blind box" toys for children, analysts believe Pop Mart International, maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain a hot consumer brand. The company's stock, which saw a brief dip, has largely recovered, as its primary demographic consists of young adults, not the young children targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's rapid international expansion, with overseas sales growing significantly, provides a cushion against potential domestic regulatory impacts. The brand's success is attributed to the "affordable exclusivity" and excitement that the mystery box model provides to collectors.</p>
