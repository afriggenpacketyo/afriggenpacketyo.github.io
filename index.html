          <p>A radar-related issue with the UK's air traffic control provider, NATS, caused significant travel disruptions, leading to over 150 flight cancellations and grounding thousands more. Airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair have demanded accountability, with Ryanair calling for the NATS CEO to resign, citing a similar major outage in August 2023. The government is investigating the failure, which NATS confirmed was not cyber-related, while travelers faced stress and disappointment from cancelled plans. The incident highlights concerns about the resilience of critical national infrastructure.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a contraction for the fourth straight month and missing market expectations. The decline is attributed to factors like extreme weather, ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., and a shift in production to lower-tariff countries. Sub-indexes for employment, new orders, and inventory also contracted, signaling a worrying economic slowdown. Analysts believe the full impact of U.S. tariffs will become more apparent in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. imposing 25% tariffs and a penalty, India has not rushed to finalize a trade agreement, primarily to protect its agricultural sector from American competition. Indian officials have stated that the interests of local farmers and small enterprises are a red line, and they will not be bound by deadlines. Analysts suggest the U.S. has a strategic interest in partnering with India as a counterweight to China in global manufacturing. This "multi-alignment" strategy allows India to diversify its trade relationships and negotiate from a position of strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans have introduced a draft congressional map that could shift five Democratic-held U.S. House seats to GOP-leaning, drawing sharp criticism from Democrats. Opponents label the plan a "blatant gerrymander" and a "likely violation of the Voting Rights Act," arguing it intentionally dilutes the voting power of minority communities for political gain. The move, encouraged by former President Trump, is part of a broader Republican strategy to maintain their narrow House majority. Democrats warn this could set a dangerous precedent for partisan redistricting nationwide.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat, Shi Mingde, has suggested that the European Union's policy of "de-risking" from China may undermine its goal of strategic autonomy by deepening its reliance on the United States. Speaking at an event in Beijing, the former ambassador to Germany argued that the EU's recent trade deal with Washington reinforces its economic and security dependence on the U.S. This perspective challenges the EU's rationale that reducing reliance on China mitigates risk, pointing out that the bloc's dependence on America is already stronger.

          <p>The man who drove an SUV into a Magdeburg Christmas market, killing six and injuring over 300, has caused further shock by sending personal letters to his victims from jail. The perpetrator, Taleb A., obtained the names and addresses of at least five survivors and mailed them handwritten letters asking for forgiveness. Recipients described feeling re-traumatized by the invasion of privacy and the confused, rambling content of the letters. The incident has raised serious questions about how the attacker accessed private information and why the prison system allowed the correspondence.</p>

          <p>Twelve employees of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) are facing disciplinary action, including termination, for allegedly holding a retirement party with heavy drinking and a stripper during work hours. The party reportedly took place at a Caltrans yard in Monterey, with a tipster alleging that some supervisors consumed alcohol and then drove state vehicles while intoxicated. Caltrans has placed the employees on administrative leave and launched a full investigation, stating the behavior is unacceptable and a violation of the department's ethical standards.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping, causing a moment of concern for the team. While the injury scare was quickly alleviated, with Ohtani remaining in the game as a designated hitter, the Dodgers ultimately lost 5-2. Ohtani looked uncomfortable on a hot and humid night after throwing a season-high 51 pitches in what was only his seventh start of the season.

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's new tariffs shows a significant impact on the U.S. and global economies, with the average U.S. tariff rate hitting its highest point since 1934. While government tariff revenue has tripled, the U.S. goods trade deficit has widened, partly due to companies stockpiling imports. China's exports to the U.S. have fallen, but its trade with other nations has grown. Economists are now seeing signs that the tariffs are starting to increase U.S. consumer prices on certain imported goods, despite an initial lag. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining the 4.25%-4.5% range despite pressure from President Trump to implement cuts. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence signaling a potential shift in sentiment. Policymakers are navigating a complex economic environment shaped by the uncertain effects of new tariffs and tax policies. While the job market remains stable, recent data shows economic growth is moderating, fueling debate over the appropriate monetary policy path. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been arrested and charged with operating an illegal high-stakes poker ring from his Los Angeles-area home. Prosecutors allege that Arenas, along with five co-defendants, ran the operation, which involved collecting a "rake" from games and hiring women to serve drinks and provide companionship to players. Arenas is facing three federal crimes, including making false statements to investigators, and has pleaded not guilty. This is not Arenas's first encounter with legal trouble, as he was previously charged with illegal gun possession during his playing career.</p>

          <p>Following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast, this article explains the science of tsunamis. These powerful ocean waves are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor. Tsunamis travel at high speeds in the deep ocean and slow down as they approach the coast, causing their wave height to increase dramatically. Scientists use a network of deep-ocean sensors and coastal tide gauges to issue warnings, but prediction remains challenging. For safety, officials advise moving at least 100 feet above sea level immediately upon receiving an alert.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led scientific expedition has discovered and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, researchers observed fields of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about life's potential in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest that these "chemosynthetic" communities are more widespread than previously thought and offer new insights into adaptation.</p>
