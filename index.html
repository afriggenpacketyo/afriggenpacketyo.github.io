          <p>President Trump lauded Saudi Arabia and its leaders after the White House announced a $600 billion investment commitment from the kingdom in U.S. deals. During an investment forum in Riyadh, Trump also declared the removal of all U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to provide them with an opportunity for growth. The agreements included a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, equipping Saudi Arabia with advanced warfighting technology from numerous U.S. firms. Trump emphasized the strong U.S.-Saudi relationship and his commitment to boosting the American economy through foreign investment. Optimism surrounding the defense sales is tempered by the removal of sanctions against Syria.</p>

          <p>Peter Coker Jr., a defendant in the $100 million New Jersey deli fraud case, was reportedly attacked by inmates in a Thai prison while awaiting extradition. His attorney cited these inhumane conditions, along with Coker Jr.'s severe cirrhosis from alcohol abuse, when requesting a lenient sentence. Coker Jr. expressed remorse for his role in the scheme, which fraudulently inflated the share price of companies, including one owning a small, money-losing deli. His father, Peter Coker Sr., received a six-month jail sentence and a $500,000 fine for his involvement in the fraud.

          <p>Kanye West's latest antisemitic song, which praises Hitler, is illegal in Germany due to strict laws prohibiting Nazi symbols and slogans. The song references "Heil Hitler" and includes artwork resembling a swastika, leading to its ban on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, though it remains on X. Germany's criminal code prohibits the use of symbols associated with unconstitutional organizations, punishable by imprisonment or a fine. While the U.S. Constitution protects hate speech under the First Amendment, other countries have banned hate symbols to counter far-right groups and growing antisemitism, as seen in Australia's new anti-hate crime law.

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, which includes significant Medicaid cuts, despite internal disagreements. Democratic members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee plan to challenge these efforts. The proposal requires states to cover a portion of SNAP benefit costs and enforces stricter work requirements. While the plan avoids some of the most drastic cuts sought by hardliners, passage remains uncertain due to conservative opposition. Trump has repeatedly pledged not to cut Medicaid, and some moderate Republicans have also expressed reservations. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the health portions of the bill would save about $715 billion, but at least 8.6 million more Americans will go uninsured.</p>

          <p>The stock market has rebounded to levels seen before President Trump's tariffs triggered a decline, with bond yields aligning with earlier figures and inflation showing a slower pace in April. However, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty about the final tariff levels, making it difficult to determine the economy's trajectory. Many feel compelled to participate in the market despite lacking conviction, fearing missed opportunities if tariffs decrease and stocks rise. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer. Uncertainty continues to affect business investment and consumer spending, influencing market dynamics.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant deported due to an administrative error, are urging a judge to reject the Trump administration's attempt to withhold information under national security claims. They argue that President Trump and other officials have publicly opposed Abrego Garcia's return, undermining any potential harm from disclosing information. The Supreme Court previously ordered the administration to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return, leading to disputes over the meaning of "facilitate." Abrego Garcia's attorneys contend that the administration's assertion of state secrets privileges is a tactic to obstruct their client's return. They cite public statements from officials stating they do not plan to bring Abrego Garcia back, questioning the administration's invocation of privilege in court.</p>

Proposed cuts to federal programs supporting infrastructure, education, and health services could lead to significant challenges for states already facing budget constraints. Republicans argue that states should assume more financial responsibility, but governors worry about the impact on essential public services. Trump's budget proposes substantial cuts to climate, education, health, and housing programs, while increasing military spending.

Hertz's revenue declined by 13% year-over-year, primarily due to the reduced fleet capacity.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered that New York City's Rikers Island jail complex be placed under the control of an outside official, effectively removing it from city oversight due to persistent violence and dysfunction. The judge, Laura Taylor Swain, appointed a remediation manager who will report directly to her and have broad powers to implement necessary changes. The order comes nearly a decade after the city's jails fell under federal oversight following a class-action lawsuit. Conditions at Rikers have not improved, with a growing jail population and multiple deaths in custody this year.

The plane, valued around $400 million, would serve as a temporary Air Force One and later be donated to Trump's presidential foundation. Critics argue the gift could influence Trump's decisions, especially given the Trump Organization's deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar. Ethics laws, including the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act and the Constitution's emoluments clauses, aim to prevent foreign governments from currying favor with presidents.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of large tariffs, inflation slowed in April, leading to questions about the economic impact. The primary reason for the lack of immediate inflation is that U.S. companies stocked up on foreign goods in anticipation of the tariffs. However, these inventories will eventually be depleted, leading to price increases. While Trump's deal with China has reduced the risk of a severe economic crisis, America's average tariff rate remains high. The big question is whether tariffs will induce a one-time surge in prices or trigger an inflationary cycle. The risk of a U.S. recession has fallen, but potential disruptions to supply chains and government deficit spending could still pose challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a $142 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia and the lifting of sanctions on Syria during his visit to the Gulf country. Speaking in Riyadh, Trump said the U.S. has "no stronger partner" than Saudi Arabia and praised the U.S.-Saudi relationship. He also announced he was lifting sanctions on Syria to "give them a chance at greatness" and said it was his "dream" to have Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords. Trump briefly addressed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, saying people in Gaza deserved a "better future."</p>

          <p>The California attorney general's office said it will seek a preliminary injunction in its case challenging President Trump's tariff policy. The move could result in a court order freezing import duties on worldwide products. The case argues that Trump lacks authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs. A hearing is scheduled for next week, and a decision could come as soon as mid-June. The attorney general's office also submitted an amicus brief supporting an effort by other states to halt the tariffs in the Court of International Trade.</p>

          <p>A former teen fashion model testifying in Harvey Weinstein’s retrial on sexual assault charges was confronted on the stand with a private journal where defense attorneys say she wrote about people who sexually abused her. Kaja Sokola protested that it shouldn’t be discussed in open court as she’d written it as part of a substance abuse treatment program years ago. Sokola testified last week that Weinstein exploited her dreams of an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was a 16-year-old on a modeling trip to New York. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.</p>

Acting ICE director Todd Lyons gave CBS News its own guided tour this week of Delaney Hall — a two-story, 1,000-bed facility, now among the largest detention centers in the Northeast. ICE and the GEO Group, the facility's owner, reached a $1 billion, 15-year deal this year to open the detention center, expanding their holding capacity along the East Coast amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. ICE officials say 75% of those detained have criminal convictions or pending criminal convictions.</p>
