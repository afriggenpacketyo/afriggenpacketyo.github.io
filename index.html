        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed near the Cabo Verde islands, is on a path to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season by this weekend. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict it will intensify into a major hurricane, potentially reaching Category 3 strength with winds over 111 mph. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, its projected path shows it nearing the Caribbean's Leeward Islands over the weekend, where tropical storm watches have been issued. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, highlighting its potential danger as it moves westward across the Atlantic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has significantly increased federal control over Washington D.C.'s local law enforcement by appointing the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the city's "emergency police commissioner." Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a directive stating that the Metropolitan Police Department must now seek approval from Cole for all orders. This move effectively sidelines the city's current police chief and is part of a broader federal crackdown on crime and immigration in the nation's capital. The action represents a major assertion of federal authority over local governance, justified by the administration under a supposed state of emergency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington D.C. that limited cooperation between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal immigration agents. This policy reversal effectively ends the city's 'sanctuary' status, allowing local police to fully assist agencies like ICE with immigration enforcement. The move is part of President Trump's broader anti-crime initiative in the city, which has placed the local police force under temporary federal control. The new orders permit D.C. police to assist in arrests based on administrative immigration warrants and transfer detainees to ICE custody, which was previously restricted.</p>

          <p>The UK division of online fashion retailer Shein reported a significant 32.3% increase in sales for 2024, reaching £2.05 billion. The company's pre-tax profit also rose to £38.25 million, reflecting strong growth despite potential economic headwinds like inflation and weaker consumer confidence. This financial success comes as the Singapore-headquartered company pursues an initial public offering in Hong Kong after facing regulatory hurdles with its previous plans to list in London. The filing highlights both the company's expansion in the UK market and the various risks it faces, including supply chain issues and regulatory changes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of losing momentum in July as key data for retail sales and industrial output fell short of forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.7% year-over-year, a slowdown from June and below analysts' expectations, indicating persistent weakness in domestic demand. Industrial output also rose at its slowest pace since last November, while fixed-asset investment expansion decelerated, particularly with a worsening contraction in the property sector. These figures suggest that the initial boost from government stimulus is fading, raising concerns about whether China can meet its annual growth target without additional policy support.

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has foiled a coup attempt, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national accused of being a foreign agent. In a statement on state television, Security Minister General Daoud Aly Mohammedine claimed the group had support from abroad and sought to destabilize the country. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the junta, which seized power in 2020 and 2021. The arrests, including that of a popular general, are seen by some analysts as a move to intimidate opponents and consolidate power rather than a response to a legitimate coup attempt.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by an annualized rate of 1% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing forecasts and demonstrating resilience in the face of trade headwinds from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by strong exports, which rebounded despite the imposition of a 15% blanket tariff on all U.S.-bound goods, including automobiles. While the performance exceeded expectations, economists remain cautious about the future, warning of a potential slowdown as investment spending softens and the full impact of tariffs affects corporate profits and wages. Personal consumption is expected to rise but could be short-lived if trade pressures persist. (not investment advice)</p>

The Queensland Court of Appeal cited the man's early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and potential for rehabilitation as reasons for the change.

This high-stakes proposal, dubbed the "election rigging response act," would only take effect if Texas or another state advances a mid-decade partisan gerrymander.

The report also highlighted Oregon's high vulnerability to environmental hazards like droughts and wildfires as a significant challenge. In contrast, neighboring Washington was ranked the 35th best state, outperforming Oregon in several key categories. The top-ranked states to move to included Utah, New Hampshire, and Idaho.</p>

In Novi Sad, protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, leading to clashes with riot police. The student-led protests, initially sparked by a deadly infrastructure collapse blamed on corruption, now demand an early election. President Aleksandar Vucic, who has faced criticism for the country's slide towards authoritarianism, has accused the protesters of inciting violence, while international observers have expressed deep concern over the reports of violence and repression.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is experiencing a quiet economic revival. Entrepreneurs are transforming abandoned factories and buildings into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market, bringing new life to the city's historic industrial core. Although the city's population has stabilized at a lower level, the unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average, and the number of working residents has returned to pre-pandemic levels. This slow but steady comeback is being driven by local business owners determined to forge a new identity for Youngstown beyond its steel-producing past.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of prioritizing profits over child safety. The suit, brought by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox has failed to implement effective safety measures, creating an environment where sexual predators can victimize children. The lawsuit points to a lack of substantial age verification, allowing adults to pose as children and interact with minors. While Roblox has stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for exploitation and has rolled out new AI detection systems, the state argues the platform remains a dangerous space for its young user base.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. However, very few of those who perceive this trend view it as a positive development. The survey found that people's views on tipping vary, with some seeing it as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, while others consider it an additional mandatory cost. This sentiment aligns with broader public concern over rising prices and costs, suggesting that the expansion of tipping culture is contributing to financial pressure for many consumers.</p>

This campaign addresses growing concerns over UK citizens seeking cheaper treatments like dental work and hair implants overseas, which can lead to life-altering injuries and create costs for the NHS to fix. Influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgery. The initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and tighten regulations for cosmetic practitioners within England.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously transitioning to a fully plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had championed the vegan shift as an ethical and creative imperative, announced the change was due to business pressures and a desire to be more inclusive. The restaurant experienced a decline in private event bookings and wine sales, as corporate clients and diners were less interested in a high-end, plant-based experience. The reversal highlights the significant challenges even top-tier establishments face in promoting sustainable dining when consumer preference for luxury meat dishes remains strong.</p>

While a majority of Jewish Israelis appear untroubled by Palestinian suffering and support the war effort, a growing anti-war movement is holding silent vigils for Palestinian children killed in the conflict. The nation remains traumatized by the initial Hamas attack, with the fate of the remaining hostages central to public discourse.

          <p>As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, they approach the talks with different primary objectives. For Putin, the meeting itself is a victory, signaling a failure of Western efforts to isolate him and reasserting Russia's place on the global stage. He will likely push for recognition of territorial gains in Ukraine. For Trump, the goal is to be seen as a global peacemaker, having promised to end the war quickly, though his approach has been inconsistent. This analysis suggests Putin may seek to offer Trump a superficial win that aligns with Russia's strategic aims.</p>
