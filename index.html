This major downward revision, the largest on record since 2002, suggests the U.S. labor market and overall economy were on weaker footing than previously understood. The adjustments, primarily in sectors like leisure, hospitality, and retail, are fueling calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to stimulate the slowing economy.

          <p>President Donald Trump has refused to comment on a recently released letter he allegedly signed for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday book, calling the matter a "dead issue." The message, part of documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee, has been labeled "fake" by Trump, who previously filed a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for reporting on it. While Democrats are demanding answers, the White House maintains the signature is not the president's, and the committee chairman has criticized the selective release of documents.</p>

          <p>An attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militia affiliated with ISIS, has resulted in the deaths of at least 60 people attending a funeral in Eastern Congo. The assailants used machetes and firearms during the nighttime assault in Nyoto, a town in the North Kivu province. This region has long been plagued by violence from over 120 armed groups competing for control over valuable mineral reserves. The ADF, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., is considered one of the most brutal militias operating in the area.</p>

Israeli officials stated the operation was justified as it targeted individuals responsible for the October 7th massacre and ongoing attacks against Israel. Qatar condemned the strike as a "cowardly Israeli attack" and a violation of its sovereignty, while the U.S. confirmed its forces were not involved. The attack has drawn condemnation from international leaders and raises tensions in a region where Qatar has been a key mediator.</p>

Phillips was fatally shot by police during a confrontation following an attempted burglary, during which he opened fire and wounded an officer. His three children, aged 9 to 12, were found safe and are now in care after being raised in isolation without formal schooling or healthcare. The children's mother expressed relief that their "ordeal has come to an end."</p>

          <p>While eligibility for Medicare is based on age or disability status rather than income, high earners may face increased costs for their coverage. A mechanism known as the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) can lead to higher premiums for Medicare Part B (medical insurance) and Part D (prescription drugs). For instance, individuals with a modified adjusted gross income above $106,000 in 2025 will pay more than the standard premium. This article explains that while you cannot make too much money to qualify, strategic financial planning can help manage these income-based surcharges in retirement.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Downing Street, where he intends to discuss the "intolerable situation in Gaza." The meeting comes shortly after Israel's strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar and amid calls from some UK parliamentarians to deny Herzog entry over allegations of war crimes. The UK government has stated it has not concluded that Israel is committing genocide, emphasizing that such determinations are for international courts to make. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has publicly stated that Herzog needs to answer for the allegations leveled against his government.</p>

          <p>Keeta Vaccaro, the estranged wife of Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, has alleged multiple instances of domestic violence in recent court filings related to their divorce. The documents detail eight alleged incidents of abuse since their marriage in late 2023, including claims that Hill violently attacked her while she was pregnant. Hill's attorney has dismissed the allegations as a "smear campaign" aimed at securing a larger financial settlement. As of Tuesday, Hill is not facing any criminal charges related to these new accusations from his estranged wife.</p>

TfL has described the union's demands, including a 32-hour work week, as "unaffordable," while the RMT leader stated industrial relations have "totally collapsed."

          <p>A group of over 40 polar scientists has issued a warning against implementing geoengineering techniques in the Arctic and Antarctic to combat climate change. They argue that radical ideas, such as artificially thickening sea ice or releasing reflective particles into the atmosphere, are dangerous, unproven, and could cause severe environmental harm. The researchers stress that these controversial methods are a distraction from the only established solution: reducing fossil fuel emissions to achieve net zero. They also raise concerns about the geopolitical tensions that could arise from any nation unilaterally deploying such technologies.</p>

Researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology believe the deck began to fail more than seven minutes before the main tower fell, killing 98 people. The investigation points to critical design flaws and misplaced steel reinforcement from the time of the building's construction four decades ago, which created low margins of safety. The final report on the tragedy has been delayed and is now expected in 2026.</p>

          <p>A state prisoner, identified as 35-year-old Joshua Orozco, was shot and killed outside a community reentry facility near MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. Another inmate was wounded in the attack, which occurred as they were returning from an approved activity. The facility is part of a program that allows inmates to serve the final months of their sentences in a residential setting with access to support services. The suspect, who exchanged words with the victims before opening fire, fled the scene and has not been identified by police.</p>

          <h2>Michigan Judge Dismisses Criminal Charges Against 15 Pro-Trump 'Fake Electors'</h2>

          <p>A judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 individuals who signed false certificates claiming Donald Trump won the state's 2020 electoral votes. The judge cited a lack of sufficient evidence to prove fraudulent intent, a key element of the charges brought by Attorney General Dana Nessel. This ruling represents a significant setback for prosecutors in one of several state-level cases attempting to hold so-called "fake electors" accountable for their role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Nessel criticized the decision, stating the evidence of their intent was clear, and her office is considering an appeal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy is grappling with deflation, forcing businesses to cut prices as consumers become more cautious and hunt for value. This trend is driven by economic uncertainty and excess capacity in various sectors, leading to intense price competition in areas from hospitality to food delivery. In response, consumer behavior is shifting, with a growing demand for second-hand luxury goods as even affluent shoppers cut back. The Chinese government is concerned about deflation becoming entrenched and has begun implementing regulations to control pricing as key economic indicators remain negative.

          <p>Microsoft has announced a new policy requiring employees to work from an office at least three days a week, beginning in February 2025 for those near its Washington headquarters. The policy will subsequently roll out to the company's other U.S. and international locations, ending the more flexible hybrid model established during the pandemic. In a memo, the company's human resources chief stated the change is not about reducing headcount but about fostering the "energy and momentum" that comes from in-person collaboration. This move aligns Microsoft with other major tech companies that have been pushing for a more significant return to office work.</p>
