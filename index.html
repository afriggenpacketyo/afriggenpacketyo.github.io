          <p>Heavy rainfall has triggered flash flooding across the Northeast, severely impacting over 50 million people. In New York City, floodwaters inundated subway stations, and major roadways like the Cross Bronx Expressway were blocked, causing widespread travel chaos. The severe weather led to thousands of flight cancellations and delays nationwide, with East Coast airports being the most affected. New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency, urging residents to stay indoors as some areas received up to five inches of rain, with rainfall rates reaching three to four inches per hour in some locations.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume selling its H20 AI chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. The sales were previously halted in April due to U.S. export controls designed to limit Beijing's access to advanced technology. This development, which follows lobbying efforts by CEO Jensen Huang and a meeting with President Trump, marks a significant policy shift. The news was met with positive market reaction, as analysts believe the resumption of H20 sales will reinforce Nvidia's market leadership in China and serve as a new growth catalyst.</p>

          <p>Police in Atlanta are investigating the theft of unreleased music, video footage, and tour plans belonging to Beyoncé. The materials were on five thumb drives inside two suitcases stolen from a rented SUV used by the artist's choreographer and a dancer. The vehicle's trunk window was smashed, and two MacBook laptops, headphones, and luxury clothing were also taken. The theft occurred just before Beyoncé was scheduled to begin a series of performances in the city. An arrest warrant has been issued for an unnamed suspect, with CCTV footage and fingerprints being used in the investigation.</p>

          <p>The trial has commenced for James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors allege that Craig, who was having an affair, used a work computer to research "undetectable poisons" and purchase them online before his wife's death in March 2023. The defense is expected to challenge the admissibility of electronic evidence, including his search history and messages with his mistress. The case has drawn significant media attention, and jury selection is focused on finding impartial jurors despite the high-profile nature of the allegations.</p>

          <p>Chinese commercial space company Space Pioneer announced its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a critical ground-based structural test. The test simulated the intense stresses of key mission phases, including lift-off and flight, on the rocket's nine-engine first stage. This success is a significant step forward for the company, especially after a mishap in June of the previous year where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed during a static-fire test. The company emphasized that the rocket's tail section must endure enormous forces, and this successful test demonstrates its structural integrity for future missions and reusability.</p>

The first facility, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. One of these clusters is described as covering an area nearly the size of Manhattan and could scale up to five gigawatts of power. While this major investment signals Meta's ambition to lead in AI, it also raises concerns about the immense energy and water consumption required for such large-scale AI operations.</p>

The report highlights issues within the NHS, the arts, and education, suggesting that Jewish identity be recognized as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure proper handling of discrimination.

          <p>A rare jury trial is underway to determine if Tesla shares responsibility for the 2019 death of Naibel Benavides, who was struck by a Model S operating on Autopilot in Florida. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the driver-assistance feature failed to apply the brakes or warn the driver before the high-speed collision. Tesla contends the driver, who had dropped his phone, is solely to blame for the crash due to being distracted. This case is significant as most previous lawsuits against Tesla have been settled or dismissed, and it will scrutinize the capabilities and safety claims of the company's Autopilot technology.</p>

          <p>According to analysts, the United States is facing an uphill battle in its efforts to secure explicit public commitments from Japan and Australia regarding their potential actions in a conflict over Taiwan. Washington's push to pressure these key allies is seen by some as a sign of weakening confidence in its own ability to manage regional tensions with Beijing. Chinese analysts suggest the U.S. strategy is primarily aimed at amplifying the "China threat" narrative to encourage increased defense spending and military cooperation from its partners. The move aligns with President Trump's maximum pressure approach, but securing a formal, public pledge remains unlikely.</p>

While plants are not sentient, they produce these sounds through physical processes when stressed. This discovery opens up a new field of research into how various animals might use these plant-based auditory cues for decisions about pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter, and how plants may have coevolved this ability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. While products like Zyn are smoke-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to children. Researchers analyzed U.S. poison center data and found that although pouch ingestions were a small fraction of all nicotine cases, they were more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. Health experts are calling for a ban on flavored nicotine products, which are sold in colorful packaging that can be attractive to children.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested in Victorville, California, on suspicion of filing a false police report after a teddy bear appearing to be made of human skin was found at a gas station. The macabre object prompted a response from sheriff's deputies and the coroner, who determined it was not made of human remains. The incident was revealed to be a prank, and authorities arrested Hector Corona Villanueva for allegedly planting the fake evidence. The artist who created the bear confirmed she had sold it to a customer in the area but was unaware of their intentions, as officials noted such pranks waste valuable emergency resources.</p>

          <p>The position of FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is reportedly in jeopardy following a contentious meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bongino, a former right-wing media personality, is said to have stormed out of the meeting and is considering resignation. The dispute stems from the recent Justice Department conclusion that Epstein committed suicide and that a rumored high-profile client list does not exist, contradicting theories previously pushed by both Bongino and Bondi. This internal feud within the Trump administration highlights the divisive impact of the Epstein case on the "Make America Great Again" movement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny the appeal of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to the district of Florida and did not bind other federal districts. The government also stated that Maxwell was, at best, an incidental beneficiary and that they were not fully aware of her central role in the scheme when the deal was made.</p>

Port officials describe this as a "tariff whipsaw effect," with shifting timelines creating uncertainty and volatility in shipping volumes.
