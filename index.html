        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to lift its two-year ban on seafood imports from Japan, which was imposed due to concerns over the release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement, reached during a meeting in Beijing, requires Japan to register fishery processing facilities and ensure seafood is free of radioactive substances like caesium-137. China halted seafood imports in 2023, citing risks to its fishing industry and coastal communities after Japan began releasing treated wastewater that it claimed met international safety standards. The resumption of exports from areas outside the Fukushima region is expected soon after China completes necessary procedures.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, won the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, earning over $50,000 in cash and prizes after defeating eight other finalists. Zaki, who was last year's runner-up, correctly spelled "éclaircissement" to win the competition held just outside Washington, D.C. The final rounds saw multiple misspellings from the finalists, adding to the drama of the competition, which began with 243 young spellers who qualified through local and regional bees.

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year due to tariffs and tightened border policies, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. Positive sentiment dropped from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025, with many business travel buyers anticipating reduced employee trips and spending. Concerns include rising business travel costs and visa processing problems, leading some companies to consider relocating events from the U.S. to other countries; however, global airfares are slightly down, suggesting not all aspects of the industry are negatively affected.</p>

          <p>A US Court of International Trade ruling challenged President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, arguing he exceeded his emergency powers, but a federal appeals court has temporarily stayed the ruling. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision would cripple the president's ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. The president has used tariffs as a key economic weapon, but the court challenges could force him to seek Congressional approval, removing the element of surprise from his trade strategy.

Badenoch argues that these leaders are advocating for taxpayers to fund unlimited child support, which the country cannot afford, and that Britain needs leaders who take economics seriously.</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old woman with advanced cancer is experiencing delays in her life-saving treatment due to the Trump administration's cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Natalie Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, is part of a clinical trial at the NIH, but staff reductions have delayed her treatment by several weeks. The situation has sparked a dispute between a Democratic senator and the US health secretary, with conflicting claims about the reason for the delay and the impact of the cuts on clinical trials.</p>

The device, called the BlueChirper, emits a loud cricket-like sound whenever someone passes by, regardless of their intentions. While the property management company claims positive results, the city of West Hollywood is investigating whether the device complies with local noise ordinances, as it contradicts the city's outreach-based approach to addressing homelessness. The device represents a trend of property owners using deterrents to make public spaces less welcoming to the unhoused.</p>
