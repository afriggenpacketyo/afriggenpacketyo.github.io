          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries early Monday morning. Police are actively searching for three suspects captured on surveillance video and have recovered nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence from the scene. Authorities believe a firearm modified to be automatic was used in the attack, which occurred during a violent holiday weekend in the city. Community leaders expressed heartbreak over the violence, which has deeply affected the South Philadelphia neighborhood.</p>

          <p>Two 19-year-old camp counselors from Mexico, Silvana Garza Valdez and María Paula Zárate, have described their harrowing experience managing young campers during the catastrophic floods at Camp Mystic in Texas. They recalled keeping the children calm with songs and games while preparing for a potential evacuation as floodwaters rose dangerously. The counselors wrote the girls' names on their skin for identification purposes before they were eventually evacuated by Army trucks. The incident, which claimed the lives of 27 campers and staff, left the counselors reflecting on the surreal and terrifying nature of the disaster.</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility over three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home. The attack, which also injured his wife Yvette, is believed to be connected to the fatal shooting of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband on the same night. Authorities have described the incidents as "politically motivated" and have a suspect, Vance Boelter, in custody facing multiple federal and state charges. Hoffman's wife, who was also shot, was released from the hospital in June.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the change is being rolled out at major airports with the goal of implementing it nationwide soon. This policy shift aims to speed up security checkpoints, though passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove their footwear for additional screening. The original rule was established in 2006, years after Richard Reid's failed attempt to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a flight.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself amid its ongoing war with Russia. This decision comes shortly after the White House confirmed a temporary pause on some weapon shipments, citing a review of U.S. military stockpiles. The President emphasized the weapons are primarily for defensive purposes, stating Ukraine is "getting hit very hard." The announcement followed recent calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia, with Trump expressing disappointment in his conversation with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore over the United States for their higher education, citing cultural similarities, safety concerns, and a more welcoming environment. Industry insiders note that while the U.S. has long been the top choice, Singapore is experiencing an uptick in applications from China amid perceptions of increasing instability in America. Students are drawn to Singapore's high-ranking universities, economic openness, and familiar cultural aspects like cuisine. This trend reflects a significant shift in the global education preferences of Chinese nationals seeking to study and work abroad.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that parking lots are the site of one in five vehicle accidents in the United States, resulting in over 500 deaths and 60,000 injuries annually. The study identifies cities like San Bernardino, California, where parking lots constitute nearly half of the downtown area, displacing safer infrastructure. Common contributing factors include widespread driver distraction, such as using phones and GPS, and poor design elements like inadequate lighting and unclear markings. The analysis suggests that improving design, maintenance, and driver behavior could significantly enhance safety in these ubiquitous concrete spaces.</p>

The move is seen as a way to simplify travel and encourage more international visitors after a slow recovery post-pandemic.

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in central Texas that killed over 100 people were caused by a confluence of weather factors, including moisture from a tropical system and a slow-moving storm that dumped immense rainfall over a flood-prone region.

Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the lack of timely evacuation orders and a robust warning system, with some survivors stating they received no alerts.

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct large-scale layoffs, which could have affected tens of thousands of employees in August. The VA stated that staff reductions achieved through a hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition have eliminated the need for a mass reduction-in-force (RIF). The department is on pace to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year, a smaller number than the up to 80,000 cuts initially considered. Critics argue the high attrition rate is due to a "toxic work environment" that could still impact veteran care.</p>

          <p>China's Civil Aviation Administration has activated a new westbound flight route, W121, near the median line of the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei. This is the last of three branches off the main M503 north-south flight path, which at its closest point is only 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial dividing line. Beijing stated the move was a technical adjustment to ease air traffic pressure and improve safety for cross-strait flights. However, the unilateral action has previously been met with alarm in Taiwan, which views such moves as a potential security risk.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. The review, detailed in a public memo, also stated that investigators found no evidence of a "client list" or proof that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals. The findings aim to dispel long-running conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death and his connections. The memo confirmed that video footage showed no one entered Epstein's cell area at the time of his death and that the review uncovered no evidence to warrant investigations against uncharged third parties.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a planned $2.2 billion purchase of 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing their vulnerability in modern warfare. A South Korean lawmaker explained the decision was influenced by the war in Ukraine, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of drones and advanced air defenses against traditional platforms like helicopters. Instead of investing in what are now seen as expensive legacy systems, the country plans to redirect the funds toward developing drones, smart systems, and other capabilities better suited for the future battlefield. This move signals a significant shift in military procurement strategy.</p>

Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared the march an official municipal event, theoretically exempting it from the ban. Despite a law allowing for fines and potential prison time for organizers of banned gatherings, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people in a challenge to the government's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose new tariffs on more than a dozen countries, set to take effect on August 1. The plan includes a 25% tariff on goods from Japan and South Korea, with varying rates for other nations, such as a 40% tariff on imports from Myanmar and Laos. The White House is extending a freeze on previously announced tariffs to the new August deadline, after which the new rates will apply. The administration argues the tariffs protect American businesses, but economists warn they could raise consumer prices and hinder economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The report found that overcrowding and a lack of purposeful activities contribute to drug use, with 39% of surveyed prisoners saying it was easy to get drugs.

          <p>The deadly Texas floods have sparked intense scrutiny into why residents and campers received little to no warning before the catastrophic event. An analysis found that while the National Weather Service issued multiple alerts, no emergency text alerts were initiated by local Kerr County officials, and the most urgent warnings came in the middle of the night. The disaster has also revived concerns about whether staffing and budget cuts at the NWS hampered forecasting and coordination with local emergency managers. Officials are now debating the installation of a physical siren system that had been previously discussed but never funded.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash flood in Texas serves as a stark warning for California, which faces similar dangers from extreme weather, according to experts. California's topography, with its hilly terrain and river systems, creates a high potential for flash flooding, particularly from intense atmospheric river storms. While California may have stronger regulations restricting construction in high-risk floodways, many communities, campgrounds, and homeless encampments remain vulnerable. Scientists note that climate change is increasing the risk of extreme floods, making disasters like the one in Texas a more pressing concern for the state.</p>
