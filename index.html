          <p>During the US PGA Championship, both Shane Lowry and Tyrrell Hatton displayed their frustration with the course conditions, resulting in outbursts that could lead to fines. Lowry swore about the course after not receiving relief for an embedded ball, while Hatton swore at his driver after a poor tee shot. Hatton acknowledged his behavior, admitting he sometimes says the wrong thing when running hot in the moment, and noted that it was not his finest moment on the course. Both golfers' tempers flared amidst challenging conditions at Quail Hollow, highlighting the intense pressure of the championship. </p>

          <p>Former Wales rugby international Jamie Roberts is set to begin his medical career as a junior doctor in the NHS, twelve years after graduating from Cardiff University's school of medicine. Roberts, who won 94 caps for Wales and was a British and Irish Lion, balanced his rugby career with his medical studies, completing his undergraduate degree over seven years due to his sporting commitments. He later pursued postgraduate degrees while continuing to play rugby, and after retiring from the sport, Roberts passed a "return to medicine" exam. Roberts hopes to specialize in sports medicine or orthopedics, drawing from his own experiences with injuries sustained during his rugby career.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, with authorities suspecting they received help from individuals within the Sheriffâ€™s Office. The inmates broke through a cell wall and left taunting messages for officials before shedding their jail uniforms and scaling a wall to escape. Three inmates were captured later that day, while the remaining escapees are considered armed and dangerous. The Sheriffâ€™s Office is investigating multiple security failures, including defective locks, inoperable security cameras, and a civilian employee who left their post to get food at the time of the escape.</p>

          <p>According to analysts, China is employing a flexible strategy to engage with nations that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, as evidenced by the participation of delegations from Haiti and St Lucia at a high-level forum in Beijing. Despite these countries recognizing Taiwan, their attendance at the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum indicates a pragmatic approach to diplomacy. Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that both countries had informed them of their intention to attend, and that relations remained stable. This approach reflects a broader trend among countries towards more practical diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>Automatic gunfire was heard in the central Gaza Strip early Saturday, following an announcement by the Israeli military that its troops were preparing for a major advance into the territory. The origin of the gunfire is unknown, but it prompted some civilians to flee westward. This comes after intensified Israeli bombardment overnight and amidst ongoing efforts by mediators to broker a new temporary truce between Israel and Hamas. The conflict, which began in October 2023, has resulted in significant casualties and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the UN warning of widespread hunger due to an Israeli blockade.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for its presidential election, which will determine whether Donald Tusk's pro-European government can advance its reform plans, currently blocked by the national-conservative president. The two front-runners are left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, and national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) party. Trzaskowski aims to restore the rule of law and liberalize social policies, while Nawrocki criticizes immigrants and EU policies. The election's outcome will significantly impact Poland's domestic and foreign policies, with a runoff likely between Trzaskowski and Nawrocki.</p>

The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust and carrying it into the city. Visibility dropped to zero in some areas, causing drivers to pull over and flights to be temporarily grounded at Midway International Airport. The dust storm cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, leaving residents in awe of the unusual phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump received a series of accolades and economic pledges during his tour of the Middle East, a stark contrast to the challenges he faces at home. He was treated with honor and respect in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, securing investment pledges and receiving the UAE's highest civilian honor. The trip allowed Trump to announce over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and the visited nations. While his administration faces criticism over tariff policies and ethics at home, Trump's visit to the Arabian Peninsula was marked by enthusiastic support and economic gains.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear they may not survive the tariffs imposed on their goods sent to the United States, their biggest market. The United States' appetite for guns has long provided a steady market for Gorazdeâ€™s main industry, the weapons factories built when Bosnia was part of Yugoslavia. The tariffs announced by Trump for almost all of the United Statesâ€™ trading partners have stalled expansion plans and risk scaring off American customers. The mayor of Gorazde worries that the United States has abandoned a faith in free trade and economic development as a path to peace.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge pleaded not guilty to federal charges of helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts involving Judge Shelley Joseph. Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape a courtroom to avoid ICE. While the charges against Joseph were later dropped, the case highlights the conflict between state judges' autonomy and federal immigration enforcement. The cases raise questions about the balance between equal justice and immigration law enforcement.</p>

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment and aid in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its presence and wielding its wealth across the continent. The UAE's investments, primarily in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects, have exploded in recent years, dwarfing amounts pledged by other countries. This is part of a plan to increase the countryâ€™s influence, particularly over global supply chains. While the U.S. reduces its presence in Africa, the UAE is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, and it sees Africa as an essential part of the plan.</p>

The article suggests that Trump's decision not to visit Israel during his Middle East tour and the fact that Netanyahu has visited the White House twice since Trump's inauguration may indicate underlying tensions.

Mitsuo Hosaka, a child welfare worker, describes the children's initial state, their indoctrination, and the gradual process of reintegration into society. The children had been subjected to abuse and taught to deny their parents, but over time, they began to regain their childlike selves and reconnect with their families.

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare coverage. Key components of the bill to fund President Donald Trump's agenda would provide major tax breaks by cutting spending elsewhere, including massive cuts to Medicaid. An analysis estimates that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured by millions, disproportionately affecting vulnerable and underserved populations. While some Republicans claim the cuts will only eliminate fraud, many Americans fear losing access to necessary medical care and having to choose between healthcare and basic necessities.</p>
