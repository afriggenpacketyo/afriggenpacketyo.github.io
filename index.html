          <h2>CVS Caremark Restricts Access to Zepbound for Weight Loss Amidst Cost Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 20:08:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to favor Wegovy over Zepbound for weight loss treatments has sparked controversy due to Zepbound's superior weight loss results as demonstrated in research. This shift, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, limits patient choice and disrupts treatment continuity, according to the article. Patients like Ellen Davis, who experienced significant weight loss with Zepbound, now face forced medication switches, prompting concerns about health progress stalling and the prioritization of cost over patient well-being. The move affects individuals with private insurance whose employers selected Caremark's most popular list of medicines, while other benefit managers have not taken similar actions. Optimism surrounding this decision is low, with many patients left feeling uncertain about the future of their healthcare.</p>

          <p>Hamas has stated it will release Israeli-American Edan Alexander from Gaza, signaling a potential step towards a ceasefire agreement with Israel. This announcement follows secret talks with the U.S. and is intended to facilitate aid to Gaza. President Trump confirmed the agreement, emphasizing the goal of ending the war and returning all hostages. While Israeli officials have not commented, they acknowledge being informed of Hamas's intention. The announcement precedes Trump's visit to the Gulf region, where discussions on Gaza's future are expected. This is an encouraging development, but significant challenges remain in securing a comprehensive ceasefire and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has found that Mounjaro is more effective, resulting in a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. Both drugs work by mimicking hormones that suppress appetite, but Mounjaro mimics two hormones while Wegovy mimics only one. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer, Eli Lilly, involved obese participants and showed that those on Mounjaro also experienced greater waistline reduction and improved blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. While both drugs are considered good options, doctors suggest Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose the most weight.</p>

          <p>The nomination of Jeanine Pirro as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, following the collapse of Edward Martin's nomination, has elicited varied reactions. Pirro, a staunch Trump loyalist, replaces Martin, a 'Stop the Steal' advocate, triggering criticism from Democrats and cautious optimism from some within the Justice Department. Concerns linger about Pirro's ability to transition from partisan TV pronouncements to the Justice Department's impartial standards. Martin will now serve on a Justice Department task force as a pardon attorney. This role involves federal corruption cases, high-profile defendants, and local criminal prosecutions, requiring a shift from Pirro's often provocative TV persona.</p>

Following its theft, a South Korean temple claimed the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, leading to legal battles. South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, facilitating the return. This event marks a positive step in easing tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>California is facing a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges, testing its resilience. The state is grappling with a potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies, a $1 billion budget shortfall in Los Angeles, and a growing homelessness crisis. Compounding these issues is an adversarial relationship with the Trump administration, limiting federal assistance. Despite these challenges, some leaders remain optimistic, citing California's history of overcoming adversity. However, concerns persist about the state's ability to maintain its status as a beacon of opportunity amid rising costs and political division.</p>

The program offers resettlement to 'Afrikaner refugees' facing 'government-sponsored race-based discrimination,' referencing land expropriation laws. This initiative is based on claims of persecution of white South Africans by the Black majority, despite Afrikaners remaining one of the most privileged races in the country. The rapid pathway for resettlement contrasts with the normal refugee process. The Trump administration has also stopped virtually all other refugee admissions under an executive order.</p>

Saudi Arabia has committed to investing $600 billion in the U.S., but Trump seeks to increase this to $1 trillion, including arms purchases.

          <p>The United States is temporarily suspending imports of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports due to the detection of screwworm, a parasite that can be fatal, in remote farms. Secretary Brooke Rollins stated that the suspension is to review the joint strategy in combating the pest and protect the nation's food supply. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué expressed disagreement but confidence in reaching an agreement. The screwworm, which has been spreading north, poses a threat to warm-blooded animals, including humans.

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Edan Alexander, the last living American citizen held captive in Gaza, prior to President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The decision follows talks with the United States and is seen as a gesture of goodwill. The release aims to facilitate a ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza. President Trump praised the move as a step towards ending the conflict. The announcement comes as Trump is set to visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, though not Israel.</p>

This technology bypasses spinal cord injuries, sending signals wirelessly from the brain to the healthy part of the spinal cord.
