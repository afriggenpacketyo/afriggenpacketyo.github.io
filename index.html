          <p>A woman was mauled by a brown bear while hiking on a popular trail in Alaska's Chugach Mountains. She managed to call 911 despite being unable to walk and was located by officials using drones before being evacuated by helicopter. Her injuries are not considered life-threatening, and authorities have closed the area while they search for the bear, advising other hikers to take necessary precautions like carrying bear spray.</p>

          <p>China has established a near-monopoly on refining rare earth elements, which are crucial for modern electronics and defense systems, by implementing a long-term strategic plan. This involved learning from U.S. operations, enduring periods of unregulated and environmentally damaging mining, and ultimately consolidating the industry into six state-controlled giants. This dominance gives Beijing significant leverage in global trade, as demonstrated by recent export controls that have prompted the U.S. to reinvest in its own domestic refining capabilities.

          <p>Heathrow Airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, expressed frustration for having slept through emergency calls during a major incident in March. A fire at a National Grid substation, caused by a known but unfixed fault, led to a power outage that closed the airport and forced the cancellation of 1,300 flights. Heathrow is now considering legal action against National Grid for the disruption, which contributed to its pre-tax profits falling by 37.2% in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to review the legality of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The case, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, challenges the import taxes on the grounds that they exceed presidential authority and address ordinary economic issues, not the "unusual and extraordinary" threats required by the law. The court's decision will likely determine how quickly the Supreme Court must weigh in, potentially impacting a trade policy that has contributed to rising inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests China's Economic Woes Require Deeper Institutional Reform Beyond Stimulus</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists, including those from Peking University, argue that China's economic challenges, such as deflationary pressures, signal the need for fundamental institutional reforms rather than just short-term stimulus. The focus is shifting toward boosting "total factor productivity" through innovation and, more critically, systemic changes to how the economy is managed. This includes reforming the incentive structure for local officials, which currently encourages production over consumption and has contributed to industrial overcapacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "massive" trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal tariffs of 15% on the country's exports to the U.S. The agreement, which reportedly lowers the duty on Japanese auto imports from 25%, is a significant development for Japan's critical automotive sector. As part of the deal, Japan will also invest $550 billion in the United States and further open its markets to American goods, including agricultural products, which spurred a rally in Japanese auto stocks.

          <p>Djelika "Mami" Tounkara, a Malian basketball player, is still seeking justice years after she was retaliated against for reporting sexual abuse by her former coach.

Her case has been caught in a "maze" of legal processes with basketball's governing body, FIBA, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport recently ruled it lacked jurisdiction, creating further delays.</p>

          <p>Amid a period of seemingly constant protests in the U.S., from the Women's March to racial justice uprisings, questions are emerging about their long-term effectiveness. An NPR discussion with author Gloria J. Browne-Marshall and journalist Lex McMenamin explores the history of protest in the United States to understand what makes resistance successful. The conversation delves into what past movements can teach current activists and re-evaluates what constitutes a "win" in today's complex political and social landscape.</p>

          <p>A report from AI firm Anthropic suggests that China is pulling ahead in the global artificial intelligence race due to its significant advantage in power generation capacity. Last year, China added ten times more power capacity than the U.S., a concerning disparity given that the American AI sector alone is projected to require at least 50 gigawatts by 2028. This energy constraint could become a critical bottleneck for U.S. technological development, limiting its ability to compete with China.</p>

Core inflation, which excludes transport and accommodation costs, also held steady at 0.6%. These soft figures provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease its monetary policy to support the export-dependent economy amid an uncertain global trade environment. The MAS has noted that growth is expected to be "subdued" in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
