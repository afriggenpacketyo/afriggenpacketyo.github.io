          <p>Reece Galbraith, 33, has been sentenced to 14 years in jail after admitting to two counts of manslaughter following an explosion at an illegal cannabis factory in Benwell, Newcastle. The blast, caused by a butane buildup during the production of drug-infused sweets, resulted in the death of seven-year-old Archie York and Jason Laws, 35, who was also involved in the operation. The explosion obliterated several homes, displacing dozens and causing millions in damages, leaving Archie's family devastated and the local community severely impacted. Archie's mother confronted Galbraith in court, expressing the family's unforgiving stance towards his actions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, a day after the U.S. announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria. The meeting, overseen by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and joined by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan via phone, focused on opportunities for Syria to rebuild ties with the West and normalize relations with Israel by signing onto the Abraham Accords. Trump encouraged al-Sharaa to expel foreign terrorists, deport Palestinian terrorists, assist in preventing the resurgence of ISIS, and assume responsibility for ISIS detention centers in northeast Syria.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, a court has stated that the European Commission should not have denied a New York Times journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Pfizer‚Äôs chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The court rejected the commission's argument that text messages are ‚Äúshort-lived‚Äù and lack important information, emphasizing the need for credible explanations when requested documents cannot be found. This decision underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in the European Union, particularly regarding negotiations that involve taxpayer money and shape public policy.

          <p>Burberry revealed plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally as part of a cost-reduction strategy aimed at saving ¬£60 million by 2027, adding to the ¬£40 million in cost-cutting measures announced previously. The job cuts, impacting about 20% of the company's workforce, will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. The move comes as Burberry reported a 6% decline in fiscal fourth-quarter sales and a 12% drop for the fiscal year, with weakness across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Despite the challenges, CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future and its ability to achieve sustainable profitable growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts towards gender equality, many people still assume mothers are the default parent, leading to frustrating experiences for fathers. Schools, pediatricians, and even strangers often contact mothers first, even when fathers are listed as the primary contact or are more available. Research supports this bias, with principals being more likely to call pretend mothers back than pretend fathers, regardless of availability. Outdated software systems in kid-related institutions also contribute to the problem, making it difficult to update contact preferences. This default parent assumption adds stress to mothers' lives and undermines fathers' active involvement in parenting.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to end animal experimentation, including phasing out animal testing requirements for monoclonal antibodies by the FDA and reviving an EPA ban on animal testing. The NIH also plans to reduce animal use and accelerate the development of animal-free methods, citing the limited relevance of animal models to human outcomes. While animal welfare advocates celebrate these moves, scientists express skepticism due to simultaneous cuts to research budgets and a lack of new funding for animal-free research.

          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia, marking a significant shift for a former Islamist militant who once had a U.S. bounty on his head. Trump's decision to meet al-Sharaa could boost the new Syrian government's efforts to rebuild ties with the Western world after years of sanctions. During the meeting, Trump urged al-Sharaa to normalize ties with Israel, expel foreign terrorists, and prevent the resurgence of ISIS. The meeting occurred a day after Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, aiming to give them a chance at greatness.</p>

          <p>A landmark resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to pave the way for more 'minerals for muscle' agreements, where minerals and geopolitics closely intertwine. The agreement, designed to deepen economic ties and bolster Ukraine's reconstruction, positions the country as a supplier of strategically important minerals to the U.S. Experts suggest that this type of deal, exchanging minerals for security or trade agreements, could expand to other countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, resource nationalism and existing trade relationships may limit the widespread adoption of such agreements.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock warns that Republican-proposed Medicaid work requirements could have disastrous effects on Americans' access to healthcare, based on experiences in Arkansas and Georgia. These rules, which he terms 'work reporting requirements,' involve complex rules and red tape that prevent working Americans from getting coverage. Warnock argues these requirements do not incentivize work and will result in hardworking individuals losing their healthcare. He contends that providing healthcare without these requirements encourages people to work and strengthens the economy, contrasting with the Republican view that subsidizing capable adults who choose not to work undermines the program.</p>
