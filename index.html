            <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) maintained its policy rate at 2.75% to stabilize the won, despite acknowledging potential economic slowdowns influenced by U.S. tariff policies and domestic stimulus measures.

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another widespread power outage, affecting 1.4 million customers and prompting officials to investigate the cause.

            <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled $2.7 million in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about anti-American sentiment and ideological bias on campus. The university has been ordered to submit visa records by April 30, potentially jeopardizing its ability to enroll international students. This action follows President Trump's call for the IRS to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and is part of a broader federal crackdown on campus antisemitism.

            <p>Major UK business groups are advocating for changes to the government's Employment Rights Bill, arguing that the proposed reforms could hinder economic growth. The bill aims to enhance workers' rights, including guaranteed hours and restrictions on zero-hour contracts. However, business leaders fear the legislation could discourage hiring and increase administrative costs for companies. The government maintains the bill will significantly improve workers' rights, while the Office for Budget Responsibility has yet to assess its full economic impact.</p>

            <p>Former Los Angeles Rams star Aaron Donald was granted a temporary restraining order against a woman who has allegedly been stalking him and his family since 2020. Donald claims the woman, Janelle Anwar, has sent threatening emails, packages, and Google Chat messages, including threats against his 3-year-old son.

            <p>An investigation has traced the flow of assault rifles and pistols from the US to gang-ravaged Haiti, revealing lax laws, absent checks, and suspected corruption. The weapons, stashed in cardboard boxes among food and clothes, bypassed a UN embargo. A UN panel found that Haitian brothers in the US used "straw buyers" to purchase the weapons. Experts say outgoing cargo checks from the US are "very scattershot" due to the volume of shipments.</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, owner of Simplified, a Florida-based stationery business, is suing the Trump administration over tariffs on Chinese imports. Ley argues the tariffs, which have cost her company nearly $1.2 million since Trump's first term, are an illegal use of emergency powers and threaten her business's survival. She claims the tariffs, potentially totaling 145%, would force her to drastically increase prices, making her products unaffordable. The White House defends the tariffs as necessary to address national emergencies.</p>

Experts note that improved screening, broader definitions, and better access to services contribute to the increase in diagnoses. The study also found that autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children.</p>
