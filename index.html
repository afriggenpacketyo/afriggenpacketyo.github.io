Trump, who previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order delaying the enforcement date to September 17. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support and confirmed ongoing collaboration with Vice President Vance's Office.

          <p>The principal of Dundee University and two senior members of its governing body have resigned following a critical report on the university's financial collapse, which led to a £22 million government bailout. The report cited poor financial judgment, weak governance, and a failure to address a significant drop in international student recruitment. It highlighted that nearly £40 million of ringfenced money had been spent elsewhere, and there was a lack of action to address an £8 million shortfall. The report also noted a resistance to difficult conversations and a failure to control costs despite declining student numbers.</p>

          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year earlier than previously forecast, potentially leading to a 19% to 23% cut in benefits. The accelerated timeline is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Experts suggest raising revenue by lifting the income cap or adjusting benefits to address the shortfall. Changes to Social Security, including the Social Security Fairness Act and a surge in early benefits claims, are impacting the program's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's new film, "The Damned," explores the Civil War through a naturalistic and observational lens, focusing on the dazed souls and uncertainties of the time. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army, highlighting the minutiae of their military life with minimal combat. Minervini avoids traditional antiwar tropes, instead capturing the characters' internal struggles and the spiritual purgatory they inhabit. While the film has limitations due to its overdetermined nature, it subtly pinpoints the economic inequalities, brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to affect America.</p>
