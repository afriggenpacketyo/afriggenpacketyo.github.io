          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that the federal government is planning to deploy the California National Guard in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles, which have seen clashes between demonstrators and authorities. Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, asserting that local authorities can handle the situation. Federal agents have been conducting immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, leading to protests and arrests, with officials on both sides pointing fingers regarding the handling of the situation. The LAPD has denied claims of delayed response, citing the deployment of irritants by federal agents as a factor. Optimism about the resolution of the conflict and the prevention of further escalation is relatively low.</p>

          <p>Miami Marlins pitcher Ryan Weathers was struck in the head by a throw from his catcher during warmups before a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Weathers was visibly in pain but initially remained in the game, pitching a scoreless first inning. However, he was later removed from the game after three innings for precautionary reasons and will undergo further evaluation. The Marlins have been struggling this season, and the incident adds to their challenges despite Weathers' strong performance in his recent starts; the team will be looking for more positive news after his evaluation.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on whether to halve the time required to apply for citizenship, a move that has polarized the country. The proposal aims to reduce the waiting period from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European nations. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, deeming the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open", while proponents argue the reform would integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the country. The outcome could affect up to 1.4 million people, offering them greater access to jobs and opportunities; the referendum's success hinges on voter turnout exceeding 50%.</p>

          <p>Confusion over airline carry-on baggage rules has triggered an EU legal row, with passengers often facing inconsistent regulations and unexpected fees. The EU is considering standardized sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines to add clarity to existing rules. Consumer groups argue the proposals don't go far enough, as airlines could still charge for overhead cabin bags. Customers advocate for universal hand luggage dimensions to avoid surprises and disputes at the airport.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried feces from healthy donors to combat drug-resistant superbug infections.

The study shows promising signals that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs.</p>
