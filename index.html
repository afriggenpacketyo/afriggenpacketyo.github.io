          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes U.S.-Russia summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly stated that his country will not cede the Donbas region in exchange for a ceasefire. He warned that any such concession could serve as a springboard for future Russian attacks and expressed frustration at being excluded from the direct talks. This declaration comes as Russian forces make fresh advances on the eastern front, which Zelenskyy frames as a Russian attempt to create a narrative of strength before the summit.</p>

The budget carrier cited persistent adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel, as major challenges despite having recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company is now considering further cost-cutting measures, such as pilot furloughs and selling off aircraft, to secure the liquidity needed to stay in business.</p>

          <p>Tesla is actively hiring test drivers in New York City to operate vehicles with its automated driving systems, even though the company has not applied for the required city or state permits for autonomous vehicle testing. This move highlights Tesla's aggressive approach to data collection for its Full Self-Driving technology, placing it in a regulatory gray area. The situation contrasts with competitors like Waymo, which have formally applied for permits, and brings further scrutiny to Tesla's controversial AV development strategy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced his intention to sue Apple, alleging antitrust violations because his X and Grok applications are not featured in the App Store's 'Must Have' recommendations. Musk questioned whether the omission was politically motivated, arguing that X is the number one news app and Grok is among the top five apps overall. This threat adds to the growing list of legal and regulatory challenges Apple faces regarding its App Store practices, which have been criticized for allegedly stifling competition.</p>

          <p>While on a personal holiday in the UK, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held a one-on-one meeting with Robert Jenrick, a prominent and ambitious conservative Member of Parliament. Although a meeting with Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch did not occur due to what was described as scheduling difficulties, the engagement with Jenrick has drawn notice. Both politicians are known for their staunchly conservative positions on cultural issues, and the meeting underscores the ongoing ideological connections between American and British right-wing figures.</p>

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, this article analyzes the potential interest earnings between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account in the current economic climate. It breaks down the math over different timeframes, illustrating that while high-yield savings accounts may currently offer higher variable rates, CDs provide a guaranteed fixed return. This makes CDs a potentially safer bet if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates in the near future, protecting savers from rate drops. (not investment advice)</p>

This strong performance in its first earnings report as a public company was driven by a 90% year-over-year growth in the circulation of USDC, which now stands at $61.3 billion. The results highlight increasing interest from major financial institutions in stablecoins, which has been bolstered by a more supportive regulatory environment for digital assets under the current administration.

          <p>The Indian state of Odisha is implementing a strict ban on the sale of gasoline and diesel in unauthorized containers like plastic bottles, citing severe public safety and environmental hazards. Because fuel is corrosive and its vapors are highly flammable, storing it in unapproved containers creates a significant risk of leaks and fires. The new zero-tolerance policy, which requires fuel stations to use only approved containers, was also prompted by a recent series of self-immolation incidents in the state.</p>
