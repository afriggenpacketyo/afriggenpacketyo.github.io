          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top economic advisor to President Trump, expressed confidence that court rulings against the administration's tariffs will be overturned on appeal. Hassett stated that the administration believes its tariffs are legal and necessary to ensure fair trade, particularly regarding combating barriers against American goods and stemming the flow of fentanyl. He criticized the judges' ruling, asserting that it hinders important trade negotiations and downplays the fentanyl crisis.

          <p>A trio of U.S.-based astronomers searching for the hypothetical "Planet Nine" have discovered a new dwarf planet, 2017 OF201, in the outer solar system. The object is roughly 430 miles across and has an extremely elongated orbit that takes 25,000 years. Its orbit does not follow the clustered trend of similar objects, potentially weakening the argument for Planet Nine's existence, although more data is needed. The discovery highlights the potential for groundbreaking discoveries through open science and archival data, demonstrating that significant findings aren't limited to those with access to the largest telescopes.</p>

He said that China has indicated they will take deliveries, with the first deliveries occurring next month.

A rally supporting Nepal's current status as a republic took place nearby, with riot police deployed to keep the two groups separated.

          <p>A recent US court ruling against President Trump's tariffs does not significantly alter the US-UK trade deal. The tariffs ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. While the UK has a deal with the US to reduce tariffs on these goods, it has yet to be implemented. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for businesses.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. court ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative legal means to enact them. Goldman Sachs economists suggest options including Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930. Section 122 could allow for a swift replacement of the 10% tariff with a similar one, while Section 301 investigations and Section 232 tariffs, already in place for steel and aluminum, could be broadened. The administration's appeal of the court ruling signals its intent to maintain its tariff agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that China's efforts to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers predate the 2022 restrictions and are rooted in the "Made in China 2025" strategy. The controls are viewed as a national security measure to prevent fueling China's military rise, rather than a protection of Nvidia's commercial interests.

          <p>Israeli ministers have announced the approval of 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, marking the biggest expansion in decades. Several existing outposts, built without government authorization, will now be legalized, while others are entirely new. This move has sparked controversy, with the Palestinian presidency calling it a "dangerous escalation" and the anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now warning it will dramatically reshape the West Bank. The expansion reflects the ongoing tensions and disputes over land between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
