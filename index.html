        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's August export growth hit a six-month low, increasing by 4.4% year-on-year and missing economists' 5.0% estimate, partly due to reduced front-loading ahead of U.S. tariffs. Imports also underperformed expectations, rising 1.3%, reflecting ongoing domestic demand weakness, a persistent real estate slump, and rising job insecurity. While Beijing has sought to diversify trade to regions like Southeast Asia and the EU, the U.S. remains its largest single-country trading partner. Analysts anticipate continued pressure on exports due to tightening U.S. scrutiny over "transshipments" and project negative inflation figures for the coming month, signaling economic headwinds.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, particularly Japan, reacted positively to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix reaching a record high. Investors are now eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with the latter's pro-deregulation and anti-interest-rate-hike stance seen as a potential growth driver. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and bond yields rose amidst persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate a period of extended uncertainty for Japan into Q4 2025, despite the initial market optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump warned foreign companies to adhere to U.S. immigration laws after a raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia led to the detention of around 475 workers, primarily South Koreans. This operation, the largest of its kind under Trump's anti-migrant initiative, prompted the President to state that while foreign investments are encouraged, companies must legally bring their skilled personnel and commit to hiring and training American workers. He acknowledged a need to train American workers for complex industries like battery manufacturing, suggesting a temporary allowance for foreign experts to facilitate this. The incident has strained U.S.-South Korean relations, with Seoul seeking the workers' release.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, widely known as the "mushroom murderer," has been sentenced to life imprisonment in Australia, with a non-parole period of 33 years. She was convicted of triple murder for serving a fatal beef Wellington lunch laced with death cap mushrooms in 2023, which resulted in the deaths of her estranged husband's parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson. The fourth victim, Ian Wilkinson, survived but sustained severe health damage. Patterson maintains her innocence, and the motive for the killings remains unclear, a factor that has fueled continued public and media fascination with the case.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was captured on camera pushing a Buffalo Bills fan after a touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins during Sunday night's game. The fan, positioned close to the field, had reportedly smacked both Hopkins and Jackson on their helmets as they neared the barrier. Although no penalty was issued for the interaction, Jackson appeared to quickly regain his composure on the sideline. This 29-yard touchdown pass, a one-handed catch by Hopkins, significantly extended Baltimore's lead to 34-19 by the end of the third quarter, proving instrumental in the Ravens' dominant performance against the Bills.</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, discovered that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This finding is significant because, based on current understanding, Mars should not have cooled sufficiently to form such a core, similar in proportion to Earth's. The discovery might reignite discussions about whether Earth was unique in developing plate tectonics. This unexpected geological feature challenges existing planetary formation models and adds Mars to the exclusive list of celestial bodies, including Earth and the moon, confirmed to have solid inner cores.</p>

His austerity budget, targeting €44bn in spending cuts, faces almost certain rejection. The crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call a snap election in 2024, which resulted in a weakened minority government and a parliament increasingly leaning towards the right and far-right, led by figures like Jordan Bardella.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet in Lowestoft, Suffolk, completely unaware she was pregnant. This rare phenomenon, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects about one in 2,500 births. Mrs. Robinson reported no unusual symptoms, mistaking hip pain for a pre-existing condition. Her husband and mother-in-law rushed to assist, with an off-duty paramedic providing help until an ambulance arrived. The couple named their son Henry James in memory of a family friend, adding a poignant layer to the miraculous and surprising arrival.</p>

          <p>Linebacker Nate Landman's crucial forced fumble in the final minutes sealed the Los Angeles Rams' 14-9 season-opening victory over the Houston Texans. With the Texans threatening to score, Landman expertly stripped the ball from a running back, recovered by Braden Fiske, securing the win. The Rams' defense delivered a strong performance, limiting the Texans to three field goals and recording multiple sacks and an interception. Quarterback Matthew Stafford also made history, surpassing 60,000 career passing yards. Despite some offensive fine-tuning needed, the team's complementary play and defensive grit marked a positive start to their tenth season in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Margaret, who lives in London, and her husband Peter, residing in Australia, have maintained a faithful and happy marriage for 15 years despite living in different countries. This arrangement, known as "living apart together" (LAT), is uncommon for married couples but allows Margaret to pursue a new career in London after raising four children and earning a PhD. While Peter remains in their family home in Brisbane, the couple prioritizes regular communication to bridge the geographical distance. Experts suggest LAT relationships can provide space for individual interests and identity, contributing to a strong bond when both partners are committed to the unconventional setup.</p>

This "crown jewel" of the park, where Walt Disney reportedly conceived Disneyland, ceased operation in 2022 following its previous operator's death. The carousel, built in 1926 and featuring hand-carved horses, is one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds. Although it requires significant repairs, its acquisition is part of a broader park restoration project expected to be completed before the 2028 Olympic Games. The city's commitment ensures this beloved landmark will continue to delight visitors for years to come.</p>

The weakening U.S. dollar and the massive projected growth of Asia's AI market, expected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, are key factors.

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, and parts of Europe and Africa, witnessed a spectacular "Blood Moon" on Sunday night during a total lunar eclipse. This celestial event occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. The phenomenon is attributed to sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily, allowing red light to reach the moon. People in Asia, particularly India and China, had the best views, while Europeans and Africans caught a partial glimpse as the moon rose.</p>
