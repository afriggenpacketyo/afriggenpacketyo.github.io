        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs rise, companies are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to reduce duties, which involves altering products' materials or dimensions to fit into lower-tariff categories. This practice, while not new, has become more prevalent during Trump's second term due to broad-based tariffs and exemptions. For example, some manufacturers initially bundled steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties, but reversed course when tariffs on those materials increased. Customs lawyers emphasize that strategic design choices to reduce duty liability are acceptable, with over 5,000 product classification codes available for tariff assessment. Winnebago Industries, a recreational vehicle manufacturer, also plans to employ tariff mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three more bullet trains experienced malfunctions after services were suspended for over five hours between Tokyo and northeastern Japan due to a train failure. The trains, a new type that debuted last year, all experienced auxiliary power unit failures, prompting investigations into potential links. One train halted in Tochigi Prefecture, causing cancellations and delays, while another became immobile at Koriyama Station.

This move follows previous reports of North Korea supplying troops and weapons to support Russia's war in Ukraine. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu stated that Kim Jong Un agreed to send 1,000 sappers and 5,000 construction workers, with plans to erect memorials for North Korean soldiers who died in the region. The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised concerns among the U.S., South Korea, and their allies regarding potential technology transfers that could advance North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.</p>

          <p>An Air India flight bound for London Gatwick crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, prompting an investigation into the cause of the disaster. The aircraft, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner carrying 242 people, issued a mayday call before losing altitude and crashing. Investigators will examine the wreckage, flight data, and cockpit voice recorders to determine the cause, considering possibilities such as engine failure, improperly extended flaps, maintenance errors, or crew actions. The investigation will involve matching physical evidence with recorded aircraft performance data to understand the sequence of events leading to the crash, with initial clues expected to come from examining the engines.</p>

Legal experts suggest this shift indicates perceived weaknesses in the government's case, which relies heavily on testimony from ex-girlfriends and ex-employees. The defense emphasizes the prosecution's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, while the judge has reprimanded both sides for violating a gag order. The trial includes testimony and videos related to alleged sexual encounters, with Combs maintaining his innocence amidst charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, and prostitution.</p>

The test included a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where the spacecraft's escape engines ignited to simulate an emergency during lift-off. The return capsule reached its designated altitude, separated cleanly, and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag system. The Mengzhou spacecraft, designed for both near-Earth and deep-space missions, represents China's first test of this kind since 1998, marking a significant advancement in its space program.</p>

They have also uncovered unsafe fillers and fat-dissolving injections being sold online, with concerns particularly focused on young people receiving injections without proper age verification. The UK Health Security Agency has reported adverse side-effects from suspected counterfeit Botox, and there are worries about dangerous fat injections like liquid Brazilian butt lifts.</p>

          <p>Australia is set to become the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. While blood donation rules will still require a three-month wait for those engaging in anal sex with new or multiple partners, plasma donation will be more accessible. Lifeblood hopes the changes will boost plasma supplies, addressing a global demand increase, though some argue the approach to blood donation remains conservative compared to other countries.</p>

Exports to the U.S. fell by 11.1%, with automobile exports plummeting by 24.7%. The Bank of Japan has acknowledged that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade factors and declining domestic corporate profits. Experts suggest that tariffs pose a significant threat to Japan's economic outlook, with the country facing a potential 'reciprocal' tariff rate on exports starting in July.

This involves a managed transition of crucial capabilities from the US to Europe over the next five to ten years, rather than sudden unilateral announcements.
