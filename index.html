          <h2>Trump Announces Secondary Sanctions for Countries Buying Iranian Oil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 15:09:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump declared that any country purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran would face secondary sanctions, preventing them from conducting business with the United States. This announcement led to a rise in U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent prices. According to Rapidan Energy CEO Scott Modell, these sanctions are primarily aimed at China, a major importer of Iranian oil, and are intended to reinforce Trump's negotiation strategy with Iran by exerting maximum pressure. The president has been seeking a new nuclear deal with Iran, accusing the country of financing militant groups with its oil revenue, which Iran denies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Mike Waltz, currently the national security advisor, as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. This decision follows reports that Waltz would be leaving his current role due to ongoing controversy surrounding a Signal messaging app chat thread he created. The chat thread was reportedly used by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reveal U.S. military plans to other Trump administration officials, including someone from The Atlantic magazine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor until a permanent replacement is found.</p>

          <p>Eleven Syracuse high school students surrendered to police following allegations of a hazing incident involving younger lacrosse team members, described by the district attorney as "hazing on steroids." The incident reportedly involved students dressed as kidnappers, armed with a handgun and knife, who tied up and placed a pillowcase over a victim's head. A former teammate described the accused students as "good people that made bad decisions" and expressed concern about the negative perception this incident could cast on the community. The school subsequently canceled the remainder of the varsity boys lacrosse season, a decision some deemed unfair to uninvolved players.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and Anthropic are publicly disagreeing over U.S. artificial intelligence policy, specifically regarding chip export restrictions to China. Anthropic has advocated for stricter controls, claiming Chinese smuggling tactics involve hiding chips in various ways. Nvidia responded by stating that American firms should focus on innovation instead of making such claims. These restrictions, known as the "AI Diffusion Rule," are set to take effect May 15, aiming to prevent China from advancing in the AI sector. President Trump is reportedly considering updates to these restrictions, adding uncertainty to the policy.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is altering its operational strategy by reducing its reliance on automation and increasing its workforce of baristas. The company will halt the deployment of its Siren automated equipment system, instead focusing on its "Green Apron service model" which involves hiring new baristas. This change comes as Starbucks aims to improve customer experience and boost sales, which have slowed recently. While technology will still play a role, the company believes that staffing stores adequately is more effective in driving growth and enhancing customer connections than solely relying on automated systems.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas, appointed by President Trump, ruled that the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport Venezuelan immigrants from South Texas was unlawful. The judge determined that Trump's invocation of the act exceeded its scope and contradicted its plain meaning. The ruling specifically addresses the Southern District of Texas, preventing the government from detaining, transferring, or removing Venezuelan individuals under the AEA based on the proclamation that they are gang members. This decision follows other court challenges to the Trump administration's use of the Act.</p>

While some scientists support understanding potential unanticipated effects, they warn that delaying approval of lifesaving shots could jeopardize public health.

          <p>Automakers such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant sales increases in April due to consumers buying new vehicles ahead of potential tariff-related price hikes. This "tariff fear-buying" was fueled by special discounts and promises from automakers not to raise prices immediately. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices rose. Experts suggest that higher costs and lower vehicle availability could lead to decreased sales in the future. President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts took effect in April, with some modifications made this week.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing significant changes to student loan repayment plans under the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan. The proposal would reduce the number of repayment options to two: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years and an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP). Under the RAP plan, monthly payments would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10% depending on their earnings. The GOP aims to overhaul the student loan system to generate savings for President Trump's planned tax cuts.</p>

          <p>With borrowing costs on the rise, debt settlement, or debt forgiveness, is an option for those struggling to repay their debts. Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the total balance owed in exchange for a lump-sum payment. Most successful settlements typically result in paying 30% to 50% less than the original balance, but the exact percentage depends on various factors, such as the borrower's financial situation and the age of the debt. While it's possible to negotiate on your own, working with a debt relief expert can offer advantages, such as professional negotiation skills and existing relationships with creditors.</p>

          <p>Federal forest officials began clearing a large homeless encampment in the Deschutes National Forest near Bend, Oregon, affecting over 100 people living in RVs and cars. The U.S. Forest Service cited fire mitigation as the reason for the closure, aiming to thin trees and remove desert grasses. Residents were warned of fines and potential jail time for trespassing after the deadline, leading to frantic efforts to repair vehicles and move belongings. The sweep comes months after the Supreme Court upheld a ban on sleeping outdoors in Grants Pass, Oregon, highlighting the ongoing challenges of homelessness and housing affordability in the region.</p>

          <p>Savers with CD accounts maturing in May 2025 should proactively research their options, considering the current interest rate environment. While high-rate options are less abundant, securing a rate of 4% or more on a new, short-term CD or high-yield savings account is still possible. Long-term CDs offer the potential for greater interest earnings but require foregoing access to funds for a longer period. Contacting the bank before the CD matures is crucial to discuss intentions and avoid automatic rollover into a potentially lower-rate account. Consider the benefits of online banks, which often offer better rates and terms.</p>

This decision challenges the administration's efforts to employ the act as part of its deportation plans.
