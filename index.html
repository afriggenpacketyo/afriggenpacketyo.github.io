          <p>The European Commission has proposed increasing the fee for its upcoming European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) from 7 euros to 20 euros. This travel authorization, set to be implemented in late 2026, will be required for travelers from 59 visa-exempt countries, including the U.S., UK, and Canada, for short stays. The commission cited inflation and operational costs for the price hike, noting it aligns the fee with similar systems in the U.S. and U.K. The proposal is now under a two-month review by the European Council and Parliament before it can be finalized.</p>

          <p>The son of an elderly British couple, detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for five months, has expressed grave fears they could die in prison. Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbie, 76, are suffering from rapidly deteriorating health, including convulsions and malnutrition, while being held without charge despite their long history of educational work in the country. Despite a judge deeming them innocent and receiving a "proof of life" photo from British officials, their release remains uncertain, with their son describing the conditions as "harrowing" and "inhumane." The family continues to await decisive action from the UK government.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a controversial bill that brings the country's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, under the control of the Prosecutor General's Office, sparking major protests across Ukraine. Critics, including Kyiv's mayor and international partners like the EU, warn this move is a significant setback for anti-corruption reform and threatens Ukraine's path to EU membership. Zelenskyy defended the law as necessary to eliminate Russian influence within these agencies and ensure justice. The decision has raised concerns about a potential slide towards authoritarianism, even as the country continues to fight against Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>India is set to resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens for the first time in five years, a move described by Beijing as positive and in the common interest of both nations. The Indian embassy in Beijing announced that applications would reopen, requiring an online form and an in-person appointment at visa centers. This development signals a potential thaw in diplomatic relations and a step towards normalizing people-to-people exchanges between the two countries. China's foreign ministry expressed readiness to continue communication with India to further facilitate these exchanges, marking a hopeful sign for bilateral ties.</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. The court ruled their trials were unfair, a major vindication for the traders who argued their actions were standard commercial practice and they were scapegoated for the 2008 financial crisis. This decision follows the quashing of all similar convictions in the United States in 2022, leaving the UK as the only country where such activities had been criminalized. The ruling raises significant questions about the effectiveness of the criminal appeal system in England and Wales.</p>

          <p>The prescription sleep medication Ambien is under renewed scrutiny following claims by Hunter Biden that his father, President Joe Biden, had been taking it, potentially contributing to his cognitive difficulties during a presidential debate. Medical experts note that Ambien (zolpidem) can cause side effects like confusion, dizziness, memory problems, and daytime grogginess, with increased risks for older adults. While some doctors stated the drug could cause such symptoms, they also cautioned that its effects should have worn off if taken the night before. Ambien is generally not recommended for long-term use in the geriatric population due to risks of cognitive decline and falls.</p>

          <p>A former late-night writer reflects on the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," arguing it represents a significant loss for American comedy and political discourse. The author suggests the timing, shortly after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's payment to Donald Trump, makes the decision appear politically motivated, regardless of the stated financial reasons. The piece laments the erosion of late-night television as a space for creating a shared reality and holding leaders accountable through humor. It concludes that in an era of division and misinformation, the need for such comedic voices is more vital than ever.</p>

While the USDA states these actions are vital for securing the U.S. agricultural research enterprise, critics and scientists argue the policy could stifle innovation and collaboration on global issues like food safety and crop productivity.

          <p>As heat waves intensify, the energy-saving strategy of "precooling"—significantly lowering a home's temperature during off-peak hours—is gaining attention, though its effectiveness is debated. Some power companies and researchers suggest it can work in efficient homes if thermostats are raised during peak energy-demand hours. However, others, like Exelon Corporation, warn it could be more expensive and strain air conditioning systems. Experts agree that basic efficiency measures like keeping windows and curtains closed are crucial. An alternative strategy involves concentrating cool air in specific areas of the home with fans or window units during the hottest parts of the day.</p>

The rise in undeclared work is seen as a form of protest by ordinary people. Additionally, critics argue that the country's generous "Bürgergeld" (citizen's income) welfare system may disincentivize legal, low-paid work and contribute to the growth of the underground economy.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has started her US Open preparation strongly with a straight-sets victory over the seventh seed, Marta Kostyuk, at the DC Open in Washington. In her first singles match since Wimbledon, the British player overcame the world No. 27 in a tough encounter, winning 7-6 (4), 6-4. After a grueling first set with multiple service breaks, Raducanu appeared more resilient in the difficult conditions, breaking early in the second set. Despite a late rally from Kostyuk, Raducanu held firm to secure the win and advance to the second round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a "massive" trade agreement with Japan that sets reciprocal tariffs at 15% and includes a $550 billion investment commitment from Japan into the United States. As part of the deal, U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports will be reduced from 25% to 15%, a significant development for Japan's critical automotive sector. The agreement also reportedly opens Japan's market further to U.S. agricultural products. The announcement provided a boost to Japanese markets, with major auto stocks soaring, and is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.</p>

Her case has been caught in a legal maze, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport recently ruling it lacked jurisdiction, sending it back to FIBA's ethics panel.

          <p>Amid a near-constant wave of protests in the U.S. in recent years, from the Women's March to racial justice uprisings, questions are emerging about their ultimate effectiveness in achieving lasting social change. A new book, "A Protest History of the United States," examines centuries of American resistance to understand which forms of protest have historically succeeded and what lessons can be applied today. The analysis considers what constitutes a "win" in the modern context of algorithm-driven social bubbles and widespread political polarization.

The firm urges Washington to reduce regulatory barriers for power infrastructure projects.

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic "Prince of Darkness" who pioneered heavy metal with Black Sabbath before launching a successful solo career, has died at 76. Born in Birmingham, he co-founded Black Sabbath in 1968, and the band's dark lyrics and heavy riffs defined a new genre. After being fired from the band in 1979 due to substance abuse, he embarked on a hugely successful solo career, selling over 40 million records. In the 2000s, he gained a new generation of fans through the reality TV show "The Osbournes," which showcased a more subdued, if still eccentric, side of the legendary rock star.</p>

While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, the falling pupil roll at the local primary school and the surge in holiday lets suggest a community under pressure.
