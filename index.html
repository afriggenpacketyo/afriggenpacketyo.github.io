          <p>A Tennessee judge has ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges; however, ICE is expected to immediately take him into custody. The judge acknowledged that the release is largely academic, as ICE will likely detain him, but emphasized the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. The judge determined that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk or a danger to the community. Abrego Garcia's attorneys claim the smuggling case is a justification for the deportation error, which occurred after the Supreme Court ordered his return amid public pressure. </p>

          <p>As AI usage grows, researchers are uncovering more instances of harmful outputs, such as hate speech and copyright infringements, which are compounded by a lack of regulations and testing. AI researcher Javier Rando stated that achieving intended model behavior remains challenging. Red teaming, a method common in cybersecurity, involves testing AI systems to identify potential harm, but Shayne Longpre notes a shortage of red team personnel. Longpre suggests opening testing to third parties and adopting standardized AI flaw reports to improve evaluation and risk understanding. </p>

          <p>A suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church near Damascus, Syria, resulted in at least 22 deaths and 63 injuries, with Syrian officials suspecting ISIS as the perpetrator. The attack, which occurred during prayers, involved an initial shooting followed by a self-detonation by the bomber. Syrian Interior Ministry spokesman Noureddine Al-Baba condemned ISIS and remnants of the Assad regime for attempting to destabilize the country, emphasizing that the security of places of worship is a red line. The bombing took place amid heightened regional tensions, following recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the Fordo site, Donald Trump posted about "regime change" in Iran. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the U.S. did not seek regime change, but Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. was at "war with Iran's nuclear program." Iran responded that the attack would have "everlasting consequences" and reserved "all options" to defend itself. Iran's envoy to the UN criticized the U.S. for stumbling into a "quagmire," raising concerns about Iran's potential response. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in the Tokyo assembly election, seen as a prelude to the upcoming House of Councillors race.

          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests avoiding threats, bribes, and harsh consequences, and instead using language that fosters cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so" or "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]" trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. The expert recommends explaining decisions respectfully, giving children agency over their behavior, and validating their emotions. Shifting from punishment to partnership and addressing the root causes of defiance can create conditions where cooperation feels natural. </p>

          <p>Pentagon officials revealed details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission, Operation Midnight Hammer, involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran. The U.S. used decoy B-2 bombers and deception tactics to maintain surprise. The strikes inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" to the targets. The Pentagon warned Iran against retaliatory action, stating that U.S. forces are on high alert. </p>

          <p>The UK government has made it known that while it was informed in advance of America's attacks on Iran, it did not participate and was not asked to. There wasn't a call from President Trump asking the prime minister whether the UK would be involved, for instance via authorizing US warplanes to use the UK military base. Having repeatedly pressed publicly for "de-escalation", saying yes to a request for help from the White House might have been difficult. Washington acting alone meant that massive, binary decision from the Prime Minister wasn't needed. </p>

          <h2>Republican Representative's Pregnancy Complicated by Abortion Law</h2>

          <p>A Florida Republican congresswoman, Kat Cammack, experienced difficulty receiving treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns about Florida's abortion law. Cammack blames fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the reluctance of hospital staff to administer the necessary medication. The incident occurred after Florida's six-week abortion ban took effect, causing medical staff to worry about potential legal repercussions. Cammack, who opposes abortion, hopes her experience will promote common ground between opposing political groups. </p>
