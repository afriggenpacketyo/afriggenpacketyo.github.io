          <p>IBM announced its first-quarter earnings, surpassing expectations for both earnings per share and revenue.

Despite a decline in infrastructure revenue, IBM highlighted its recent settlement with GlobalFoundries and acquisitions of HashiCorp and DataStax. IBM reaffirmed its full-year expectations for free cash flow and revenue growth, signaling confidence in its long-term growth opportunities in technology and the global economy.

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill reported quarterly revenue that fell short of expectations, marking the first decline in same-store sales since 2020, which was attributed to a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather conditions. The company also lowered its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth, indicating a more cautious perspective on future performance. While restaurant transactions decreased, the average check increased slightly, partially offsetting the decline. Chipotle plans to open more new restaurants by the end of 2025, and management remains confident in returning to positive transaction comps by the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration, challenging the legality of the recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that the tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy by increasing taxes on consumers. These tariffs include a 145% tariff on Chinese products and tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, asserting that this stance harms peace negotiations. Trump claims a deal to end the war was close but Zelenskyy's refusal to accept US terms will prolong the conflict. This follows US Vice-President JD Vance outlining a US vision for a deal that would freeze territorial lines close to their current positions, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to cede some territory. Tensions are evident as Trump's administration intensifies efforts to broker a ceasefire amid ongoing attacks and diplomatic shifts.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the installation of a makeup studio next to the Pentagon press briefing room, sparking controversy over the cost and priorities. The project, intended for preparing for television appearances, involved renovating an adjacent green room with new furnishings and lighting.

          <p>Following a deadly attack on tourists in Kashmir, India has downgraded diplomatic ties with Pakistan and suspended a crucial water treaty. The Indus Waters Treaty, negotiated in 1960, governs water usage from six rivers flowing through both countries. India's foreign secretary announced the treaty's suspension until Pakistan credibly ends its support for cross-border terrorism. The move comes amid long-standing accusations of Pakistan stoking armed militancy in Kashmir, a disputed region between the two nations.</p>

The color, described as a beautiful, ultra-intense teal, does not exist in nature and provides a unique visual stimulus. Researchers hope that studying the perception of 'olo' will help them understand how the eye and brain construct visual images. The research team is also exploring the possibility of enhancing human color vision in the future.</p>

          <p>Creeping erosion along Lake Michigan's shoreline is putting homes in precarious positions, particularly in Benton Harbor.

High-risk erosion areas (HREAs) erode at an average rate of one foot or greater per year over at least 15 years. Building structures too close to the bluff puts them at risk of falling into the lake, prompting concerns for homeowners in the affected areas.</p>
