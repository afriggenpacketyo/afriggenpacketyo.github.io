          <p>This New York Times article describes how the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear escalation between India and Pakistan and intervened to broker a cease-fire. The article highlights Vice President Vance's initial dismissal of the conflict as “fundamentally none of our business” and the administration's subsequent efforts to de-escalate tensions. It notes that the U.S. intervened due to concerns about missile strikes on Pakistani air bases and the potential for a full-scale war. The article emphasizes the importance of U.S. involvement in sealing the accord, despite India's lack of acknowledgement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reports on the rise in China's car sales for the third consecutive month in April, driven by government-subsidized trade-ins. Passenger vehicle sales increased 14.8% year-on-year, with electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids accounting for over half of total sales. The article notes that the government's trade-in scheme has mitigated the impact of U.S. tariffs on consumer sentiment. Car exports declined, and automated-driving systems are fading as a catalyst for sales due to regulatory scrutiny.</p>
