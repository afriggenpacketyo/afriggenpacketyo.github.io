          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) experienced a significant jump of nearly 8% following a report that IBM intends to utilize AMD's field-programmable gate array chips for a quantum computing error correction algorithm. An IBM spokesperson confirmed this development, hailing it as a crucial milestone in their ambitious plan to debut a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029. This collaboration underscores an existing agreement between the two tech giants to integrate and advance quantum computing capabilities, addressing complex problems traditional computers cannot solve without expensive GPU clusters. The announcement has sparked renewed investor interest in the broader quantum technology sector, leading to gains for several related companies, and highlighting the ongoing race among tech leaders to innovate in this transformative space.</p>

          <h2>White House Warns Government Shutdown May Prevent Next Inflation Report Release</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 16:01:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House announced that the ongoing government shutdown could lead to the unprecedented elimination or delay of the next inflation report, potentially causing significant economic disruption. This concern emerged despite recent Labor Department figures showing September inflation at a better-than-expected 3%, which President Trump celebrated alongside a strong stock market performance. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt attributed the favorable inflation numbers to Trump’s economic agenda but warned of chaos for businesses, markets, and the Federal Reserve if the critical October report is missed. Republicans blame Democrats for the shutdown, citing disputes over funding for healthcare benefits for undocumented immigrants, while Democrats dispute these claims, intensifying the political stalemate.</p>

          <p>The US military has significantly increased its presence in the Caribbean, deploying warships, fighter jets, and the CIA, marking the largest regional deployment in decades. Officially framed as a war on drug trafficking, experts and analysts suggest the campaign is primarily an intimidation tactic aimed at regime change, seeking to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Long-range bombers have conducted "attack demonstrations" off Venezuela's coast, and the US has offered a $50 million bounty for Maduro's arrest, though it has not yielded defections. The article questions the legality of US strikes, which have killed dozens, and notes the historical US involvement in Latin American regime change.</p>

          <p>A widespread manhunt has been launched in the UK for Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, a convicted sexual assailant who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu, jailed for 12 months for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and another woman, was intended for transfer to an immigration detention center prior to deportation. The Prison Service has initiated an urgent investigation into the error, with an officer removed from discharging duties. Police confirmed Kebatu boarded a London-bound train shortly after his release, sparking significant public concern and condemnation from political figures who demand his swift capture and deportation.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's federal cabinet unanimously banned the hard-line Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after violent clashes with police resulted in at least five deaths. The TLP, known for its fierce anti-blasphemy stance and previous violent confrontations, saw its recent march to Islamabad escalate into street battles. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office cited "violent and terrorist activities" for the ban. The party, which advocates for the death penalty in blasphemy cases, has amassed significant grassroots support, particularly in Punjab province, and its affiliates now face anti-terrorism charges. This marks a renewed crackdown after a previous ban in 2021 was lifted.</p>

          <p>NBA legends Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal expressed strong disapproval regarding a widespread gambling scandal that has implicated current and former NBA figures. Federal prosecutors unsealed indictments charging over 30 individuals, including Portland head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, with schemes to rig sports bets and poker games. O’Neal voiced shame for those involved, emphasizing the clear rules and potential consequences, while Barkley dismissed addiction as a factor, labeling the actions as "stupidity."

Several Palestinian factions, including Hamas, agreed to establish a temporary committee of independent technocrats to manage basic services in Gaza.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused Petro of allowing cocaine production to surge and refusing to curb drug trafficking into the United States. This move escalates an ongoing feud between President Trump and Petro, who Trump previously labeled an "illegal drug leader."

          <p>Kim Kardashian revealed a brain aneurysm diagnosis in a teaser for her reality show, appearing to attribute its cause to stress, though medical experts clarify stress is not a direct cause. Doctors, including Dr. Brian Snelling, emphasize that genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes are the primary culprits for aneurysm formation and growth. While stress can indeed raise blood pressure, it is not definitively proven to create an aneurysm, though it can contribute to an individual's vulnerability. Most brain aneurysms are small and asymptomatic unless they rupture, leading to life-threatening brain bleeds, making blood pressure control crucial for prevention.</p>

          <p>Over 2,000 mink were released from an Iowa farm after intruders cut fences and destroyed pens between Monday night and Tuesday morning, an act described by Fur Commission USA as a "terrorist act" under federal law. The incident occurred near Woodbine, Iowa, with only about 60% of the animals recovered by Friday morning. The trade group warned that most unrecovered mink would likely perish in the wild without access to food, clean water, and shelter, with some already attacking other farm animals like ducks and geese. Similar incidents, often motivated by animal compassion, have previously led to charges under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.</p>

This data, released despite the government shutdown to determine Social Security adjustments, suggests tariffs are contributing to upward price pressure, with businesses passing on some costs. Economists note that while inflation is higher than the Fed's 2% target, the cooler pace supports expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The Fed's focus on labor market risks may outweigh inflation concerns, with a 0.25-percentage point cut highly probable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dahbia Benkired has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in France for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet, a case that deeply shocked the nation. The 27-year-old Algerian immigrant, who was under orders to leave the country, must serve at least 30 years, becoming the first woman to receive such a severe penalty. CCTV footage showed Benkired luring Lola into an apartment, where she subjected the child to sexual assault before killing her through asphyxiation. The presiding judge cited the "extreme cruelty" and "true torture" of the acts, as the verdict brought some closure to Lola's grieving family.</p>

          <p>NFL star Travis Kelce, alongside activist investment firm JANA Partners, acquired a significant stake in Six Flags Entertainment, aiming to revitalize the embattled amusement park company. Kelce, a self-proclaimed "lifelong Six Flags fan," expressed hopes of making parks "even more special for the next generation of families" on social media. The investment comes as Six Flags faces $5.3 billion in debt, declining attendance, and leadership changes following its 2024 merger with Cedar Fair. Analysts view Kelce's high-profile involvement as a positive for the brand, potentially attracting younger demographics and signaling a new strategic direction for the struggling operator amidst calls for modernization.</p>

The Kentucky Innocence Project, representing Cross, presented an affidavit from a key witness who now claims she lied at trial, along with a similar admission from another witness. This development offers a potential path to vacate the conviction or secure a new trial, as Currin's and Cross's fathers have united to seek truth and justice.</p>
