          <p>American Airlines has revised its 2025 profit forecast downward, now projecting an adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, a significant reduction from its earlier estimates. The airline also issued a third-quarter forecast that fell short of analyst expectations, anticipating a potential loss between 10 and 60 cents per share. While second-quarter revenue slightly exceeded expectations at $14.39 billion, net income declined. The adjustments reflect ongoing challenges, including weaker-than-expected domestic travel demand and uncertainty in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. total fertility rate has fallen to a record low of 1.599 children per woman, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This rate is now comparable to those in many Western European countries and is below the 2.1 replacement level. While the Trump administration has proposed measures like "baby bonuses" to address the decline, some researchers are not alarmed, viewing it as part of an ongoing trend of delayed childbirth. Factors contributing to the drop include people marrying later and concerns over the financial stability required to raise children.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has officially launched a new political party named "Your Party." In a joint statement with fellow Independent MP Zarah Sultana, who recently left Labour, they described the current political system as "rigged." They are inviting supporters to an inaugural conference to help build what they envision as a new kind of political entity that belongs to everyone. The move marks a significant development in British politics, creating a new left-wing alternative for voters.</p>

          <p>Police in India have arrested a man for allegedly running a sophisticated fake embassy near New Delhi to defraud people seeking overseas employment. The suspect, Harshvardhan Jain, posed as an ambassador for non-existent micronations like "Seborga" to deceive victims. A raid on his rented property uncovered luxury cars with counterfeit diplomatic plates, doctored photos with world leaders, and nearly $52,095 in cash. Authorities suspect Jain was also involved in money laundering through international shell companies, and he now faces multiple charges including forgery and impersonation.</p>

The company's automotive revenue fell by 16% year-over-year, and CEO Elon Musk warned of potentially "rough quarters" ahead, partly due to expiring EV tax credits. The electric vehicle maker faces increasing competition, particularly from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers, and has not provided official guidance for the remainder of the year. This lack of a forecast signals potential uncertainty about returning to volume growth in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn a $20 million EPA grant intended to provide clean drinking water to communities in California's Monterey County, labeling it a "wasteful DEI program."

The funding was meant to improve municipal infrastructure and connect contaminated wells to safe water lines for about 5,500 people.

          <p>Electricity prices across the United States are rising faster than inflation, a trend expected to continue through 2026. This increase is driven by a combination of high demand, insufficient supply, and broader inflation. A significant factor is the massive investment needed to replace aging grid infrastructure and upgrade it to handle new demands from data centers, electric vehicles, and climate-driven air conditioning use. While the Trump administration promised to lower energy costs, its policies, including the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," are likely to slow the deployment of new generation and further increase prices for consumers.

          <p>BBC News, along with three major international news agencies, has issued a statement expressing grave concern for local journalists in Gaza, who are facing starvation. With Israel not permitting foreign media into the territory, the world has relied on these local reporters, who now face the same dire humanitarian conditions as the population they cover. The warning comes as over 100 aid groups report that mass starvation is imminent in the region. The news organizations are urging Israeli authorities to allow journalists access and to ensure adequate food supplies reach the people of Gaza.</p>

          <p>A 2022 sentencing memorandum from the Department of Justice starkly contrasts with its recent decision to interview Ghislaine Maxwell about Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. The memo described Maxwell as having engaged in a "significant pattern of dishonest conduct," enabling monstrous crimes and showing no remorse. Now, the DOJ is seeking her cooperation, a move that has drawn attention to her lawyers' past claims that she was a scapegoat for Epstein. This development occurs amid controversy over the Trump administration's handling of files related to the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has launched an investigation after data revealed that payment cards issued to asylum seekers have been used for gambling. A Freedom of Information request showed over 6,500 attempted gambling transactions in the last year using Aspen cards, which are provided for food and essentials. While online attempts were blocked, some were successful at physical locations like casinos and lottery retailers. The cards provide a small weekly allowance, and officials have stated that urgent action will be taken to prevent such misuse in the future.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump has degraded the office of the presidency through his public actions and rhetoric. The author cites recent events, such as baselessly accusing former President Obama of treason and using the Oval Office to attack political rivals, as unprecedented behavior. The commentary suggests these actions are distractions from other issues, like the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, but are nonetheless damaging to democratic norms. The author contends that by making such serious and unfounded allegations, Trump is tainting the very institution he leads, alarming both domestic and international observers.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that broad economic sanctions, primarily imposed by the U.S., are a form of deadly violence that kills hundreds of thousands of innocent people annually, comparable to armed conflict. The author, an economist, cites a recent study estimating 564,000 annual deaths, disproportionately affecting children. The piece contends that sanctions devastate food and health systems and are illegal under international law as a form of collective punishment. The author calls for an end to this policy, arguing its toll is less visible but just as destructive as war.</p>

Citing 60 years of the program's success, the contributor emphasizes that investing in all children present in the U.S. strengthens the nation's future by preventing greater dependency on government support later.

          <p>Unlike in the U.S., where single-family homes are often idealized, dense, high-rise apartment complexes are the aspirational form of housing in South Korea. Today, 64% of South Korean households live in multifamily housing, a result of government policies enacted 60 years ago to address a severe urban housing crisis. These large complexes, or "apateu," function like miniature towns with extensive amenities, symbolizing upward mobility. While this model has successfully housed a large population in a small area, it has also led to a homogenized urban landscape and a housing affordability crisis of its own.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles has filed a lawsuit against Tesla, accusing the company of false advertising by misleading consumers about its vehicles' autonomous capabilities. The state argues that naming features "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving" implies the cars can operate without human intervention, which they cannot. The DMV is seeking to suspend Tesla's sales in California, a major market for the company, for at least 30 days. This legal challenge comes as Tesla faces declining sales and scrutiny over CEO Elon Musk's numerous unfulfilled promises regarding the technology's development. (not investment advice)</p>

Scientists at the University of Maryland are working on a product called ErythroMer, which uses hemoglobin encased in a synthetic cell to safely deliver oxygen. This innovation could be transformative for military medics and first responders, as thousands die from hemorrhage before reaching a hospital. While animal tests have been promising, human trials are still needed, but researchers hope to begin them within two years.</p>
