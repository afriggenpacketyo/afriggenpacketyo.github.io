          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson did not advance to the 200-meter final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships, missing the qualifying time by just one-hundredth of a second. This outcome ends her bid to compete in the 200m at the upcoming World Championships, though she has an automatic entry for the 100m as the defending champion. The disappointing performance follows a difficult week for the 25-year-old athlete, who was arrested over a domestic violence allegation involving her boyfriend. Richardson's recent professional and personal challenges have cast a shadow over her preparations for the international competition.</p>

The U.S. State Department condemned the criminal violence and is providing consular assistance to the family, while Israeli authorities have opened an investigation. This event marks the second death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank in three weeks, highlighting the escalating violence in the region since the war began.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described his performance as "useless" after a challenging weekend at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he qualified and finished in 12th place. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured pole position, Hamilton struggled, fueling speculation about his future, which he quickly dismissed. Team principal Frederic Vasseur and former boss Toto Wolff both expressed understanding of his frustration, attributing it to his high standards and the difficulties of adapting to the new car. Despite the setback, they remain confident in his ability to rebound, pointing to the car's overall progress.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans to confirm a slate of President Trump's nominees broke down after Democrats requested the release of several billion dollars in previously approved government funds. Sources indicate that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought funding for entities like the National Institutes of Health and the World Food Program in exchange for the confirmations. President Trump ultimately rejected the deal, which he publicly decried as "political extortion" on social media. The collapse of the talks means dozens of nominees, including ambassadors and department officials, will remain unconfirmed until at least September.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic political maneuver, Democratic legislators in the Texas House are leaving the state to prevent a vote on a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. The move aims to break the legislative quorum, thereby halting a special session where the GOP intends to pass maps that could add up to five new Republican seats. This action mirrors previous walkouts by Texas Democrats in 2003 and 2021 to block partisan bills, though those efforts ultimately did not prevent the legislation from passing. The lawmakers, who face potential fines and arrest upon their return, are being supported by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.</p>

          <p>The latest Marvel film, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million. However, this figure represents a steep 66% decline from its impressive debut, a more significant drop than other recent superhero films. New comedy releases “The Bad Guys 2” and “The Naked Gun” secured the second and third spots, respectively, with solid openings. While the overall summer box office is tracking ahead of last year, analysts note that the longevity of major releases will be crucial for reaching industry revenue targets.</p>

In an interview, Greer indicated that while trade ministers from various countries are seeking further discussion, he does not expect significant negotiations to alter the established rates in the coming days. The administration announced a baseline 10% tariff on all imports starting August 7, with higher rates for specific countries like Canada, which faces a 35% tariff on certain goods.

          <p>In a formal court filing, the Trump administration has denied that it has a policy mandating a daily quota for immigration arrests, despite prior public statements suggesting otherwise. The denial comes in response to a lawsuit from immigrant advocacy groups and follows reports that White House officials had pushed for a target of 3,000 arrests per day. Justice Department lawyers argued that while the figure may have been discussed as a "goal," no such directive was ever issued as official policy to DHS or ICE. The discrepancy has drawn scrutiny as the administration continues to pursue an aggressive deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, led prayers at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, an act that drew widespread international condemnation and heightened regional tensions. The site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the home of the Al Aqsa Mosque, is a frequent flashpoint for conflict. While Jews are permitted to visit, they are traditionally forbidden from praying there, making Ben-Gvir's actions highly provocative. The incident is the latest in a series of controversial moves by the ultranationalist politician, who has advocated for greater Jewish control over the compound.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News personality and staunch supporter of President Trump, to the powerful position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation passed with a 50-45 vote, formalizing a role Pirro has held on an acting basis since May. Pirro, a former prosecutor and judge, was nominated after the president's previous choice failed to secure enough support. Her confirmation is one of several key appointments the Republican-led Senate pushed through before adjourning for its August break.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano, located on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume more than 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption occurred shortly after a major earthquake in the region, though it is unclear if the events are related. Russian authorities reported that the ash was spreading over the Pacific Ocean and did not pose an immediate threat to any populated areas. Volcanologists confirmed this is the first historically recorded eruption of the volcano, with its last major activity estimated to have occurred around the 15th or 16th century.</p>

The Smithsonian stated the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not the result of any political pressure.

Norris admitted he is "not making life very easy" for himself with small issues that have complicated his races this season. He successfully executed an alternate one-stop tyre strategy to recover and secure the win, a move he said was rewarding but one he initially doubted would work.</p>

          <p>Trump administration officials appeared on Sunday political shows to defend the president's economic strategy following a week of poor jobs numbers and turbulence over trade tariffs. A key point of contention was President Trump's firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics chief Erika McEntarfer, a move officials justified by citing "real concerns" about the reliability of jobs data revisions. However, the dismissal drew sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warned it undermines the credibility of vital government data and is part of a broader pattern of attacking independent institutions.</p>

          <p>The self-imposed deadline for a new U.S.-Canada trade deal has passed without an agreement, leaving the future of the deeply integrated economic relationship uncertain. Despite six months of a tariff war and recent intense negotiations, a deal remains elusive, with both sides signaling that a quick resolution is unlikely. While a current free trade agreement provides a buffer for nearly 90% of Canadian exports, ongoing U.S. tariffs on key sectors like steel and aluminum are causing economic strain. Analysts suggest that while Canada has some negotiating leeway, businesses on both sides are craving the certainty that only a new agreement can provide. (not investment advice)</p>
