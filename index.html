        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, a two-way player, at No. 2, marking a significant move. Unlike the talent-rich 2024 draft, this year's class is considered more unpredictable, with a focus on offensive and defensive lines, as only one quarterback was selected in the first 12 picks, contrasting with the unprecedented six in the previous year. The draft is being held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for the first time, and rounds two and three will take place on Friday, with rounds four through seven on Saturday.</p>

          <p>Robert Crimo III, the perpetrator of the 2022 Highland Park July 4th parade shooting, has been sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences without parole, one for each victim he murdered, plus an additional 50 years for each of the 48 attempted murder counts. Crimo was absent from the two-day sentencing hearing after skipping most of jury selection, pleading guilty to all charges shortly before opening statements. The judge's decision to impose consecutive life sentences aims to prevent any future possibility of clemency, while victims' families expressed relief that this chapter is closed, but emphasized that true justice is impossible. The shooting led to Illinois banning assault weapons in 2023, with calls for a national ban.</p>

          <p>The family of John William Cannon, who died during an American Airlines flight, is suing the airline, alleging that the flight crew delayed requesting medical assistance while he was experiencing an escalating medical crisis.

He initially claimed excitement for Booker, but later admitted he wished the team had addressed the defensive side of the ball.

          <p>Analysts suggest that Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea rich in gas and oil, could become a future flashpoint between China and the Philippines, particularly if Manila pursues unilateral resource exploration. Despite its potential, development has been stalled due to tensions between the two countries, although they have previously sought joint exploration. Factors such as Manila's limited development capacity, upcoming elections, and cautious risk assessment by multinational companies could delay this escalation. The area is estimated to hold significant oil and natural gas reserves.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have formally announced their intention to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Prosecutors argue that Mangione intentionally killed Thompson to amplify an ideological message and provoke resistance to the healthcare industry. They also claim that Mangione poses a future danger due to his expressed intent to target the industry, while Mangione's attorneys argue that the government's pursuit of the death penalty is a political stunt.

The ruling prohibits the government from taking action to withhold or condition federal funds, with the judge noting that the plaintiffs' fears of enforcement were well-founded.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly had an unsecured internet connection installed in his Pentagon office to bypass security protocols and use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer. This raises concerns about potential hacking or surveillance of sensitive defense information. Hegseth has faced scrutiny for sharing sensitive military information on private Signal group chats. The Pentagon confirmed that Hegseth does not use Signal on his government computer.</p>
