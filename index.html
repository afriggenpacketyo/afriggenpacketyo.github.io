          <p>A new study by SmartAsset has identified the best job markets in the United States, ranking 348 cities on factors like unemployment, income growth, and commute times. Bend, Oregon, secured the top spot due to its low unemployment rate and significant income growth, along with a favorable work-life balance highlighted by short commutes. The report also singles out cities for specific strengths, such as Santa Clara, California, for high health insurance coverage and Frisco, Texas, for a large percentage of remote workers.

          <p>The stock market is experiencing a significant rotation, with previously outperforming "momentum" stocks in sectors like technology and AI selling off sharply. Conversely, undervalued "laggard" stocks in areas such as industrials and health care are seeing a notable increase in interest and value. This shift has led to market volatility, and it remains uncertain whether this represents a temporary fluctuation or the beginning of a more sustained change in market leadership.

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a prominent televangelist who built a global media ministry before being embroiled in a major sex scandal, has passed away at the age of 90. Swaggart gained immense popularity in the 1980s through his televised sermons, but his career was famously derailed in 1988 when he tearfully confessed to sinning after being photographed with a sex worker. Despite being defrocked, he continued to preach and faced another similar controversy three years later. His ministry also drew criticism for controversial statements about other religions and for homophobic remarks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a comprehensive Republican legislative package with a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill, a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda, proposes making the 2017 tax cuts permanent while increasing spending on border security and defense. It is funded in part by significant cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, and the Congressional Budget Office projects it will add trillions to the federal deficit.

Versions in the House and Senate differ on income and deduction caps, and the tax break would be temporary, expiring in 2028.

          <p>The massive tax and spending package approved by Senate Republicans could have wide-ranging effects on American household finances. The legislation aims to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent while introducing new deductions for tip income, overtime pay, and auto loans. It also proposes significant spending cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, and would eliminate certain clean energy tax credits. The article provides a detailed breakdown of key provisions, including changes to the SALT deduction, child tax credit, and student loan programs, explaining their potential financial consequences for individuals.

          <p>The spending package passed by the Senate includes a proposal to permanently increase the child tax credit, a key component of the Republican fiscal agenda. If enacted, the bill would raise the maximum credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child and index it to inflation in subsequent years. This differs from the House version, which proposed a temporary increase to $2,500. However, policy experts note that because the credit is only partially refundable, the proposed changes would not benefit millions of children in the lowest-income families who do not earn enough to claim the full amount.</p>
