          <p>Following escalating tensions and military exchanges, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire brokered with U.S. assistance; however, reports soon emerged of continued fighting, particularly in the Kashmir region, with both sides accusing the other of violating the truce. Indian officials confirmed the ceasefire but accused Pakistan of violating it Saturday evening, stating that India is giving an adequate and appropriate response. President Trump initially announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, claiming U.S. mediation, though India disputed this, saying the deal was worked out directly between the two countries. Tensions have been high since an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants.</p>

          <p>Heavy flooding in eastern Congo, triggered by torrential rains, has resulted in at least 62 fatalities and dozens missing, washing away villages along Lake Tanganyika. The floods surged early Friday morning, devastating the village of Kasaba, with rescue operations hampered by service disruptions and communication shutdowns. The South Kivu provincial health minister noted the Red Cross is the only humanitarian organization currently present, as body searches continue amidst challenging conditions. This disaster follows recent flooding in Kinshasa last month, which claimed 33 lives, adding to the region's ongoing humanitarian crisis exacerbated by decades of conflict between government forces and rebel groups.</p>

          <p>As the Philippines prepares for midterm elections, many young voters are advocating for an end to the concentration of political power within entrenched political dynasties. A recent report highlighted that at least 71 of the country's 82 provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties, with some considered "obese" due to multiple family members seeking different elected positions. Critics argue that these dynasties perpetuate poverty, hinder development, and erode checks and balances, discouraging independent oversight and citizen participation. While political dynasties are prohibited under the 1987 constitution, the rule has never been enforced, leading to calls for its implementation to strengthen democratic resilience.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake struck Tennessee, with tremors felt across several southern states. The earthquake originated near Greenback, Tennessee, and prompted thousands of reports from the public. While no major damage or injuries were immediately reported, residents in areas as far as Atlanta described feeling the shaking. The southeastern U.S. carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid seismic zone and the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a program to bring white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners, to the United States as refugees, citing persecution by the Black-led government. The South African government denies these allegations, stating that Afrikaners are among the wealthiest and most successful people in the country. The U.S. claims of persecution center on farm attacks and alleged anti-white rhetoric, while South Africa argues that farm attacks are part of a broader issue of violent crime affecting all races. The program has drawn criticism and raised questions about the prioritization of certain refugee groups.</p>

          <p>Following a $750 million settlement from Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital, victims of sexual assault by gynecologist Robert Hadden are questioning the institutions' inaction. Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients to travel across state lines so that he could sexually abuse them. From 1987 until 2012, Hadden sexually assaulted and abused female patients during appointments and deliveries at Columbia University Irving medical center and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital. The settlement is another step forward in the university's ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses his career and the importance of instinct over data in decision-making. Diller argues that relying solely on data can be harmful to creative and business decisions, emphasizing the value of simple human instinct and common sense. He shares anecdotes from his time at ABC, highlighting successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were driven by instinct rather than extensive research. He believes that too much information can overload, overcomplicate, and obscure what is at the essence of any proposal.</p>

          <p>A DW article discusses how climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed and breed. Rising global temperatures, floods connected to rising sea levels, and ocean acidification are impacting coastal habitats where migratory birds rest and refuel. Extreme weather events, such as storms, also pose a threat. Warmer temperatures can lead birds to shorten their routes or abandon migration altogether, potentially causing conflicts with resident animals. The loss of habitat and the pressures of human activity have contributed to the extinction of some species, such as the slender-billed curlew.</p>
