            <p>Donald Trump stated that Volodymyr Zelensky shares responsibility with Vladimir Putin for the deaths in the Ukraine war, also criticizing President Biden's handling of the situation. Trump questioned Zelensky's competence and suggested Ukraine shouldn't have initiated a conflict against a much larger opponent. This statement follows a deadly Russian missile attack on Sumy, Ukraine, resulting in numerous casualties. Trump insisted he wanted to end the conflict and promised proposals soon.

            <p>A Chinese research team has discovered how breast cancer cells use the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and multiply. The study, published in Cancer Cell, reveals that the metabolic interplay between cancer cells and macrophages is crucial in arginine-driven breast cancer progression. This finding could lead to new precision therapies that target the metabolic dependencies of tumors, potentially starving them of arginine to halt their growth. The research offers a new avenue for treating the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. Optimism Score: 70</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing $2.3 billion in federal funds to Harvard University due to disagreements over policies related to antisemitism and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.

            <p>A federal funding freeze by the Trump administration has halted key infrastructure projects in tribal communities across the United States. Over 22 tribes and nonprofits have had around $350 million in funding frozen, often without notice, impacting projects related to climate change, housing, and community development. The freeze affects funds from the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, raising concerns about the government's commitment to these communities. The EPA stated that the agency is reviewing each grant program to ensure it is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with Administration priorities.
