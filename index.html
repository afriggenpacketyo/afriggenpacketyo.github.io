          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, citing an overreach of federal authority and a violation of the state's rights. Newsom argued that the deployment, made in response to protests against immigration enforcement, was an unnecessary escalation that inflames tensions. The lawsuit claims that Trump's action is illegal and immoral, representing an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism. Newsom emphasized that this action sets a dangerous precedent, allowing the president to federalize the National Guard in any state without the governor's consent, which is a direct violation of the U.S. Constitution. </p>

          <p>JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that Chinese equities may not be as attractive as they appear due to weakened corporate earnings resulting from the nation's economic slowdown. Mark Davids, co-head of Asia-Pacific equities, emphasized the importance of carefully screening stocks and sectors to identify potential winners. While Chinese stocks trade at valuations in line with their historical averages, the return on equity is faltering due to weaker profitability, making it difficult to argue that they are particularly cheap. Davids notes that for a re-rating to occur, there needs to be an improvement in the profitability of Chinese companies, which is challenging given the weak economic environment.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Kennedy's decision comes as he seeks to change the CDC's guidance on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, which will bypass the advisory committee process.</p>

          <p>Dr. Phil McGraw's presence during ICE raids in Los Angeles, alongside President Trump's border advisor Tom Homan, has sparked controversy and raised questions about the intersection of reality TV and immigration policy. McGraw, who is neither a journalist nor an immigration expert, was present to get a first-hand look at the operations and interview Homan for his media company. Critics argue that McGraw's involvement normalizes the controversial immigration policies and provides a platform for Trump's message. The situation is politically sensitive, as it underscores concerns about the administration's use of spectacle and divisive tactics.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is in recovery mode following a weekend of protests against President Trump's immigration roundups and the deployment of the California National Guard.

The city establishment is focused on the release of union leader David Huerta, who was arrested during an immigration raid. Despite the damage, there is a sense of resilience and determination among protesters to continue advocating for immigrant rights.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the National Guard and Marines deployed to Los Angeles amid protests, stating that they will primarily protect federal buildings and personnel. The troops will not engage crowds unless necessary and will not have ammunition loaded in their weapons. The rules emphasize de-escalation, but could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act. The Los Angeles Police Department expressed concerns about the lack of coordination and potential challenges the deployment poses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for the authority to deport immigrants to countries where they risk torture, even if immigration judges have previously ruled against deportation to those countries. The administration claims it can bypass the Convention Against Torture by deporting individuals to previously unmentioned countries after immigration proceedings. Critics argue this would deny due process and violate international law, while the administration asserts it needs this authority to enact its immigration policies. The Supreme Court's decision could significantly impact the rights of immigrants facing deportation.</p>

          <p>President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized Alabama's National Guard in 1965 to protect civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery, after Governor George Wallace refused to ensure their safety. This action, similar to President Trump's recent federalization of the California National Guard, highlights the complex relationship between federal and state authority during times of civil unrest. Johnson's decision underscored the federal government's commitment to protecting civil rights in the face of state resistance, while Trump's action has been criticized as an overreach of federal power.</p>
