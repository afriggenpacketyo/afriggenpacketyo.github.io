          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall have caused significant devastation in South Korea, leading to at least 14 deaths and leaving 12 people missing. The severe weather triggered landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, primarily in southern regions like Sancheong, which saw the highest number of casualties. Authorities reported that one person was killed when their house collapsed, while another was swept away by a swollen stream. Over 3,800 people have been evacuated from their homes as a safety precaution, though the rain has now subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted across the country.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat that capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay, resulting in the deaths of at least 38 people, has been towed to a shipyard for a thorough investigation. The incident, which occurred in the popular northern tourist destination, has prompted an official inquiry to determine the cause of the tragic accident. Video footage shows the vessel being moved as authorities begin their examination. The focus of the investigation will be on understanding the circumstances that led to the boat overturning and the significant loss of life, which has cast a somber shadow over the region's tourism industry.</p>

          <p>Greek and Turkish Cypriots held separate and contrasting commemorations to mark the 51st anniversary of the 1974 Turkish invasion that divided the island of Cyprus. In the south, Greek Cypriots observed the event with air raid sirens and memorial services for the deceased, attended by President Nikos Christodoulides. Conversely, in the breakaway north, celebrations were held, attended by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. The event underscores the deep-rooted division and ongoing geopolitical tensions between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, with reunification efforts repeatedly failing amid persistent mistrust.</p>

          <p>This article examines several high-yield midstream energy stocks, suggesting they offer stable, fee-based cash flows and growth opportunities at relatively low valuations. It highlights Energy Transfer for its high yield and growth potential, Enterprise Products Partners as a stable, long-term holding with a history of distribution growth, and Genesis Energy as a potential turnaround story following a strategic business shift. The analysis points to secular trends like supplying natural gas for AI data centers and LNG exports as key drivers for the sector's future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030, marking the first time a clear goal has been set on this issue. This pledge follows public outrage over rising pollution incidents, with data showing a 60% increase in serious pollution events in 2024. The plan also aims to reduce phosphorus pollution and ban wet wipes containing plastic. While the government's move is a response to scrutiny over water companies' performance and executive bonuses, critics note the target is a political pledge and not legally binding.</p>

          <p>A severe drought on Suva Planina, a mountain in southeast Serbia, has depleted natural water sources, endangering over 1,000 cows and horses. The drought, which began unusually early in May, has forced authorities to transport emergency water supplies via trucks to the affected area. Local cattle owners and farmers describe the situation as unprecedented, with springs drying up months earlier than usual and the land becoming cracked and arid. This event is part of a broader drought affecting the Western Balkans, leading to agricultural damage and highlighting the growing impact of climate change in the region.</p>

          <p>Filipino boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, 46, made his return to the ring after a four-year retirement, fighting WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw.

Despite showing flashes of his former speed, Pacquiao's performance slowed in the later rounds, though he expressed a belief that he won and called for a rematch. The outcome was a testament to his endurance, but also highlighted the challenge of competing at the highest level after a long hiatus.</p>

Her defense argued she believed the gun was unloaded after her husband said "No more buwwets" in an Elmer Fudd voice. Investigators were initially divided, but the discovery of a second gunshot wound and forensic analysis led to her prosecution.

          <p>Following a new trade agreement, China's exports of rare earth magnets to the United States surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, reaching 353 metric tons. This sharp increase marks a recovery in the trade of these critical minerals, which are essential for products like electric vehicles and wind turbines. The flow had been severely restricted after China added rare earths to its export control list in April, causing disruptions in global supply chains. The resolution reached in June has eased these restrictions, with analysts expecting shipments to continue recovering as more export licenses are approved.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Simon Tisdall posits that the persistent failure to achieve peace in major global conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from more than just political deadlock. The author argues that a collapse of a "permanent moral order" and the rise of moral relativism are to blame, making it nearly impossible to mediate disputes. Without universally accepted principles, arguments become endless cycles of indignation, and actions like the deliberate targeting of civilians are justified by one side while condemned by another. The piece suggests this retreat into subjective morality prevents the collective response needed to end widespread suffering.</p>

          <p>The United States is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all visitors requiring a nonimmigrant visa, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is intended to be paid upon visa issuance.
