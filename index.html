          <p>Transgender U.S. military members are facing an uncertain future as a ban implemented by the Trump administration requires them to identify themselves for potential separation from the armed forces. Colonel Bree Fram and Navy Chief Petty Officer Ryan Goodell are among those affected, expressing heartbreak and fear over the directive. Fram highlights the dedication and performance of transgender service members, while Goodell fears financial repercussions from having to repay bonuses. The article also notes the legal challenges against the ban, with Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown joining other attorneys general in arguing against the ban's discriminatory nature and harm to national security. The article explains that the Supreme Court ruled that the government can oust transgender military service members while multiple legal challenges wind their way through lower courts.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking to revoke a key rule limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, finalized by the Biden administration in April 2024. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued that the Trump administration can protect the environment while growing the economy, claiming the Biden-era rules would "suffocate our economy." The EPA also plans to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, despite evidence of its effectiveness in reducing mercury air emissions. Critics argue the rollbacks could be dangerous, with the Environmental Protection Network estimating they could lead to more than 15,000 premature deaths by 2050.</p>

The bill, which has passed the House, aims to extend and expand Trump's tax cuts and increase spending on immigration enforcement and defense. Critics, including Elon Musk, argue the bill would significantly increase the national debt and slash Medicaid benefits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would raise the deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade, potentially leading to millions losing health insurance and disproportionately benefiting the wealthy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Americans pay trillions in rent annually, few receive a credit score boost because rent payments are not commonly reported to credit bureaus. Wemimo Abbey, CEO of Esusu, highlights that over $5.3 trillion is being left on the table, as only 20% of landlords report rent payments. This financial inequity disproportionately affects minorities and immigrants, who are more likely to be "credit invisible." Esusu partners with rental companies to increase rent reporting, aiming to establish credit scores for more Americans and promote financial inclusion. Esusu charges a monthly fee of $2.50 to report timely payment on the renter's behalf, and the record of the amount paid is expected to show up roughly 30 days after it's been paid.</p>

Central banks' gold stockpiles are near levels last seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. Emerging and developing countries are increasingly attracted to gold due to concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies.

          <p>An uneasy calm has settled over Los Angeles following a night of curfew and mass arrests in response to ongoing protests over immigration raids. Nearly 400 people have been arrested, including undocumented migrants and individuals charged with assault and obstruction. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed President Trump's immigration policies for provoking the unrest. The National Guard and Marine Corps forces have been deployed to help quell the unrest, but their authority is limited to detention, not arrest. The article describes the chaotic scenes, police actions, and the political tensions between the Trump administration and state officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's EPA is proposing major rollbacks to power plant pollution limits, potentially allowing increased emissions of unhealthy air toxins and greenhouse gases. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed the rollbacks would both protect the environment and grow the economy, defying what he called "the climate change cult." The proposals target a Biden administration rule to phase out emissions from fossil fuel plants and another regulation restricting hazardous air pollutants. Critics argue the rollbacks will harm public health and the environment, while benefiting the fossil fuel industry. Health experts warned the moves would lead to the biggest pollution increases in decades.</p>

After President Trump imposed tariffs, the Treasury collected a record $22 billion in tariff payments in May.

The Tax Foundation estimates that tariffs would start to offset the tax cuts in 2029.
