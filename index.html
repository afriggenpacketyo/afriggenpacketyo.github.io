            <p>Envoys from Iran and the United States have commenced negotiations in Oman regarding Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, marking a significant step after years of heightened tensions. While an immediate comprehensive agreement is unlikely, the stakes are exceptionally high for both nations, particularly considering past threats of military action and increasing concerns about Iran's uranium enrichment levels. The talks, mediated by Omani officials, aim to establish a framework for potential future negotiations, focusing on Iran's nuclear capabilities and potential sanctions relief from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will post an updated Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) that paves the way for artificial intelligence to improve government efficiency and enhance the federal record-keeping process. The initiative is expected to streamline processes and enhance accuracy, but raises concerns about data privacy and potential biases in AI algorithms.

            <p>An editorial from Vox highlights the significant role of commerce and entrepreneurial capitalism in reducing extreme global poverty. It notes that extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day, was the norm for most of human history, but has drastically declined since 1950 due to increased global trade and economic development, particularly in countries like China. The article underscores the importance of globalization and trade in lifting millions out of poverty, while also acknowledging the downsides such as environmental impact and social disruption. The piece argues that current trends towards trade wars threaten to reverse this progress.</p>

            <p>Scotland is under an extreme wildfire warning due to unseasonably dry weather, with several fires already burning across the country. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is urging the public to act responsibly, as crews continue to battle blazes on the Isle of Arran, in Acharacle, and on the Isle of Bute. Temperatures have been well above the April average, but a return to more typical April conditions, including rain showers, is expected on Sunday, potentially alleviating the fire risk. This follows a week of multiple wildfire incidents across Scotland.</p>

            <p>Beijing has cancelled hundreds of flights and closed public parks due to high winds and sandstorms, which have also caused damage across the city. Wind gusts reached up to 148 kph (92 mph), felling trees and damaging buildings. The city's two international airports cancelled 693 flights, and popular attractions like the Forbidden City and Universal Studios were closed. The sandstorms originate in China's dry north, and the government has been working to mitigate their impact for decades. Similar conditions were experienced in 2021, leading to school closures and travel disruptions.</p>

            <p>A study by Northern Arizona University and Babbel reveals that Britishisms are increasingly common in American English, particularly among Gen Z, influenced by social media and streaming services. The most common British term used is 'bonkers,' meaning 'absurd,' followed by 'amongst,' 'queue,' and 'wonky.' Experts attribute this trend to cultural globalization and the increased exposure to British media. While some Americans embrace these linguistic imports, others remain resistant, but the exchange of phrases is generally considered a healthy aspect of language evolution.</p>

            <p>Amir Makled, a Lebanese-American attorney representing a pro-Palestinian student protester, alleges he was targeted and searched at the Detroit Metro airport upon returning from a family vacation. Makled claims immigration officials identified him as an attorney involved in high-profile cases and demanded to search his phone, leading to a confrontation over privileged client information. He says he felt compelled to provide a list of contacts after being threatened with confiscation of his device. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) disputes Makled's account, stating it was a routine secondary inspection with his consent, while digital rights advocates condemn the search as an overreach of border authority.</p>

It's not clear if the two sides will sit in the same room, but the talks are seen as an important first step to establish whether a deal can be done, with Saturday's meetings expected to focus on establishing a framework for negotiations.</p>

            <p>Vietnam's heightened tariff rates are based, in part, on its U.S. trade surplus. A portion of Vietnam's rising exports to the U.S. may be Chinese products that were rerouted to evade higher tariff rates after 2018, as a U.S.-China trade war escalated. A Harvard Business School research paper estimates that 16% of Vietnam's manufacturing increase was rerouting.

            <p>In Valparai, Tamil Nadu, authorities with the Tamil Nadu Forest Department have constructed an "invisible" solar-powered fencing system designed to alert residents of approaching animals. The 700 individual posts composing the system are solar-powered to help enable dependable operations in an area where electricity can otherwise be inconsistent. Each post is also equipped with sensors that can trigger an alarm and flashing lights any time an animal passes by. Once alerted, nearby residents can steer clear and avoid any encounters with wildlife.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of flights have been cancelled and train lines were suspended as gales hit Beijing and northern China on Saturday. Millions were urged to stay indoors on Friday, with some state media outlets warning that people weighing less than 50kg may be "easily blown away". Wind gusts of up to 93mph (150 kph) - the strongest in the Chinese capital for more than half a century - are set to continue through the weekend, forcing the closure of attractions and historic sites.</p>

            <p>Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported from the US, an immigration judge has ruled. Mr Khalil, a postgraduate student at Columbia University's school of international and public affairs, has been a prominent figure in the university's pro-Palestinian student protest movement. The 30-year-old has held a US permanent residency green card since 2024 and his wife is a US citizen. The judge ruled that the government had the right to deport him, saying its belief that his presence posed "potentially serious foreign policy consequences" was enough to satisfy requirements for his deportation.</p>

            <p>Amid news of visa cancellations and deportations, state and local tourism officials are increasingly worried about the potential adverse effects on travel to Los Angeles and California. Canadian tourists, furious over Trump threats to annex their country, are boycotting American products and canceling travel plans south of the border, including scrapping visits to popular winter destinations such as Palm Springs. International visitors are crucial to the regional industry because they tend to stay longer and spend more, tourism officials say.</p>

            <p>This week, Stephen A. Smith, my former colleague at ESPN, has again publicly said he’s considering running for president. After President Trump was able to use celebrity and mass media to rise in political power, I guess Smith figures he can do the same. There is no questioning Smith’s popularity in the world of sports and maybe that can translate into a movement. But where does he want to lead us?</p>

Those who face deportation “are entitled to notice and opportunity to challenge their removal” before a federal judge, the court said. They must be given “a reasonable time ... that will allow them” to make their case on why they should be spared from deportation, the justices said.</p>

With that ancient DNA, scientists identified gene variants specific to dire wolves and then performed multiplex gene editing with a genome from the gray wolf, dire wolves’ closest living relatives.</p>
