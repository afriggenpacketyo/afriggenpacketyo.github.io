          <h2>UK and US Trade Deal Includes Tariffs, Signaling a Shift in Global Trade</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States have reached a trade agreement that, while significant, includes tariffs, suggesting a new normal in international trade relations under President Trump's administration. The deal allows the UK to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff rate, while steel and aluminum exports are tariff-free, a reduction from the previous 25% rate. However, all other goods from the UK will still be subject to a 10% baseline tariff, indicating that complete tariff-free deals may be rare. Experts suggest this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with flexibility on sectoral tariffs but a minimum baseline tariff likely to remain.</p>

          <p>BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are turning their attention to the South Korean market, aiming to expand their reach and boost profitability. This move sets the stage for competition with established domestic brands like Hyundai and Kia.

The expansion into South Korea is seen as a way for Chinese EV makers to demonstrate their design and manufacturing capabilities in a developed auto market.</p>

The event featured a display of military hardware, including combat drones, and was attended by leaders from over 20 countries. Putin used the occasion to connect the historical victory to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, while Ukraine rejected a unilateral ceasefire announced by Russia. Xi's presence is viewed as a significant show of support for Putin, particularly given the international context of the war in Ukraine.</p>
