          <p>A drive-by shooting in Chicago's River North neighborhood left four people dead and 14 others injured. The incident occurred late Wednesday night as a crowd was leaving an album release party for local rapper Mello Buckzz at the Artis Restaurant and Lounge. Police report that a dark vehicle drove by and occupants opened fire on the group, in what is being investigated as a targeted attack. No arrests have been made, and several victims remain in critical condition as authorities continue their investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A key provision within the newly passed Republican legislative package creates a significant, albeit temporary, tax change for tipped workers. The law allows workers in occupations that customarily receive tips to deduct up to $25,000 in gratuities from their annual taxable income. This exemption, a prominent campaign promise, is designed to benefit most tipped workers but phases out for individuals earning over $150,000 a year to prevent misuse. Unless extended by a future Congress, this tax-free status for tips is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 17:19:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a thriving illegal cigarette trade on UK high streets, revealing its deep connections to serious organized crime. The report shows how mini-marts and other small shops openly sell counterfeit and smuggled tobacco, with profits often funding international crime gangs involved in people trafficking and illegal immigration. Law enforcement officials describe being in a losing battle, hampered by a lack of resources and low penalties. This illicit trade is not only costing the country billions in lost tax revenue but also eroding public trust and contributing to a sense of national decline.</p>

          <p>Despite months of protests from local residents concerned about air quality, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has secured a permit to use natural gas-burning turbines for its supercomputer facility in Memphis, Tennessee. The permit, issued by the Shelby County Health Department, establishes emissions limits and testing requirements for the 15 turbines. The decision comes as xAI faces a pending lawsuit from the NAACP alleging violations of the Clean Air Act. The company stated the facility will use state-of-the-art emissions control technology.</p>

          <p>The passage of the Republican's major spending and tax bill was achieved through intense last-minute negotiations and direct pressure from the president. Initially, several conservative and moderate Republicans opposed the bill due to concerns over the national debt and cuts to Medicaid. To win their support, party leaders and the president engaged in arm-twisting and added specific provisions, such as benefits for Alaska's whaling industry, to secure crucial votes. The process involved a seven-hour-long vote and overcoming internal party fractures, highlighting the commanding influence the president holds over his party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature domestic policy bill directs approximately $170 billion toward enhancing the administration's immigration and border security objectives. The legislation provides substantial funding to expand detention center capacity, hire more ICE personnel, and complete the border wall, aiming to support a mass deportation campaign. The bill also implements stricter eligibility requirements for safety net programs like SNAP and Medicaid for lawfully present immigrants and increases fees for immigration processes, including asylum applications. Critics argue these changes will create significant barriers for immigrants and strain humanitarian resources.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, was tragically killed by a stray bullet during a shooting in Washington, D.C. Police have stated that he was not the intended target of the violence, which also injured a woman and a 16-year-old boy. The shooting is believed to have stemmed from an altercation between two groups. The FBI and ATF are now assisting local police with the investigation, which includes enhancing video footage and conducting ballistics analysis to identify the suspect responsible for the intern's death.</p>

          <p>Israeli military strikes across Gaza on Thursday have reportedly killed at least 69 people, according to rescue services in the territory. One airstrike hit a school being used as a shelter in Gaza City, killing 15 people, while another incident reportedly killed 38 people who were queueing for aid. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a Hamas operative in the school and has called reports of extensive casualties at aid sites "lies." The attacks come amid increasing international pressure on both Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone for nearly an hour on Thursday, according to the Kremlin. The conversation occurred shortly after the White House confirmed it was pausing some weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. The two leaders reportedly discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Middle East. This high-stakes diplomatic exchange comes as the Trump administration navigates the complex geopolitical landscape, with the president scheduled to speak with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy the following day.</p>

          <p>A new academic study led by a University of London researcher estimates that more than 80,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, a figure substantially higher than official reports from the Gazan Ministry of Health. The research, which is independent of ministry records, was based on household surveys conducted on the ground in Gaza. The findings suggest that the official death toll is a conservative minimum and that women, children, and the elderly account for over half of the violent deaths. The study provides a stark, independent measure of the conflict's human cost.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology after broadcasting a performance from the rap-punk group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival in which the band led the crowd in a "Death to the IDF" chant. The BBC's director-general called the behavior "offensive and deplorable" and apologized to the Jewish community. The incident has prompted a criminal investigation by local police and led to the band's U.S. visas being revoked. In response, the BBC has announced new policies for future festival broadcasts, including keeping "high risk" acts off live streams.</p>

          <p>Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan have become severely strained following a controversial police raid in Yekaterinburg that resulted in the deaths of two ethnic Azeri men. Azerbaijan condemned the act and retaliated by cancelling cultural events and arresting Russian journalists in Baku. The dispute has escalated with more arrests on both sides, deepening a rift that began after an Azerbaijani passenger plane was shot down by a Russian missile last year. Experts suggest Moscow is losing its influence in the Caucasus as Azerbaijan asserts a more independent and assertive foreign policy.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, former diplomats argue that Secretary of State Marco Rubio's plan to reorganize the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) will effectively destroy America's ability to champion human rights globally. The plan would shutter most human rights offices and lay off the majority of its expert staff, which the authors claim will leave the U.S. unable to influence policy or address global injustices. They warn that this retreat from human rights advocacy sends a dangerous message to the world and undermines decades of bipartisan foreign policy.</p>

The talks with Google's parent company Alphabet, which owns YouTube, raise complex questions about the use of presidential power to influence private companies and the ongoing debate over free speech and content moderation on social media platforms.</p>

His performance, the highest score by an Indian batter in England, propelled the tourists to a massive total of 587. In response, England's top order crumbled, losing three quick wickets to end the day at 77-3. England now faces an immense challenge to avoid defeat and prevent India from leveling the series, requiring an unlikely turnaround against a dominant Indian bowling attack.</p>
