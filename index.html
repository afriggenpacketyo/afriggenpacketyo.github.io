        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Months after Hurricanes Helene and Milton struck Florida's Gulf Coast, residents in Pinellas County are struggling with recovery due to bureaucratic delays involving FEMA, insurance companies, and local governments, leaving homeowners in limbo and slowing down reconstruction efforts. Public adjusters report stalled cases due to insurance delays and contractor shortages, while conflicting instructions from townships further complicate the process. Despite these challenges, some businesses like Hubbard's Marina have managed to bounce back quickly, emphasizing the importance of tourism for economic recovery. The new hurricane season brings heightened anxiety, but local leaders stress that the area is open for visitors and that tourism is crucial for the region's financial revival.</p>

          <p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the former president of Mongolia, is advocating for Japan to abolish the death penalty, despite strong public support for it in Japan. Elbegdorj, who successfully terminated capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017, suggests that the Japanese government should disclose more information about the death penalty to foster an open debate. He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy, which respects human rights and the sanctity of life, and cites the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. Elbegdorj notes that violent crimes decreased in Mongolia after the death penalty was abolished, and he encourages Japanese lawmakers to exercise leadership on this issue.</p>

This agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus, which includes a 90-day suspension of tariffs imposed earlier this year. The framework was reached after two days of talks in London, and now requires approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Disputes over semiconductors, visas, and rare earth minerals had previously threatened the fragile truce, but this new framework signals a commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue between the two countries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced a curfew for downtown Los Angeles from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. to address ongoing anti-ICE protests, citing the need to stop vandalism and looting. The curfew encompasses a one-square-mile area bounded by major freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and the homeless. The protests, triggered by recent immigration raids, have resulted in numerous arrests and property damage, prompting the deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines, a move contested by Governor Newsom. The Trump administration defends the deployment as necessary to protect federal property and ICE agents from violence, while Newsom argues it exacerbates tensions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has accused President Trump of intentionally escalating the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids by deploying the National Guard and U.S. Marines. Newsom argues that Trump's actions endanger peaceful protesters and target immigrant families, asserting that state and local law enforcement had the situation under control before the federal intervention. He has filed a request for a restraining order to limit the use of federal troops, alleging that the deployment without his consent violates the U.S. Constitution.

          <p>In celebration of Juneteenth, all national parks and forests in California will offer free admission, marking one of seven free admission days for national parks and five for national forests this year. Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of the last American slaves on June 19, 1865, in Galveston, Texas. Participating National Park Service locations in Southern California include Joshua Tree, Death Valley, and Yosemite, among others. Free access will also be available on August 4, September 27, and November 11, with the U.S. Forest Service joining on the latter two dates. Other fees for parking and tours may still apply.</p>

Decker has been charged with murder and kidnapping after his daughters' bodies were discovered last week.

          <p>A UN panel has called on the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, asserting that the current agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, which returns sovereignty to Mauritius while allowing the UK to maintain a military base on Diego Garcia, is seen as hindering the Chagossians' right to return to their ancestral lands. The panel advocates for a new agreement that ensures the Chagossian people can exercise their cultural rights and access their homeland. A Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the UK-Mauritius deal has been welcomed by international organizations, including the UN Secretary-General.</p>

          <p>Mikie Sherrill, a U.S. Representative and former Navy pilot, has won the Democratic primary in New Jersey's gubernatorial race, overcoming a crowded field of experienced rivals. She will face Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli in the November general election, aiming to secure a third consecutive term for the Democrats. Sherrill's campaign focused on her personal story and making the state more affordable, while shying away from offering a broad-based plan. A victory in November would make her the second female governor of New Jersey, succeeding current Governor Phil Murphy, who is term-limited.</p>

          <p>China's J-20 stealth fighter has reportedly tripled its radar detection range due to advancements in silicon-carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology led by scientist Xu Xiangang at Shandong University. The university claims that Xu's team's SiC material has enabled a threefold increase in the detection range of phased array radar systems, giving Chinese radars a first-mover advantage. The technology is considered crucial for national security, enhancing the range of Chinese radars, improving missile accuracy, and boosting the power of laser weapons.

          <p>While officials from both parties say November's general election will hinge on local, pocketbook issues, the outcome will also be closely watched as a harbinger of how both parties might fare in next yearâ€™s midterm elections, and as a test of both Democratic enthusiasm and how the GOP fares without Trump on the ballot. Novemberâ€™s presidential election offered warning signs for Democrats in the state. While Trump lost to Democrat Kamala Harris, he did so by only 6 points â€” a significantly smaller margin than in 2020, when President Joe Biden won by 16 points.</p>

The National Police Agency has issued advisories to avoid questioning people based solely on appearance, but incidents persist. Advocacy groups and lawyers argue that such practices constitute racial discrimination, while some view increased surveillance as necessary due to growing tourism and concerns about rule violations by foreigners.</p>
