          <p>This article discusses the difficulties associated with a potential U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, particularly the Fordo plant, which is buried deep underground. The article highlights the need for specialized "bunker buster" bombs like the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which only the U.S. possesses, and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber to deliver it. Military experts suggest that even with such weapons, multiple strikes and potentially ground forces would be required to ensure the facility's destruction. The article also raises concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, potentially escalating the conflict. The piece notes that despite damage from Israeli attacks, Iran could respond to a US strike, leading to a wider regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick has strengthened into a Category 4 storm as it approaches Mexico's Pacific coast, prompting warnings of devastating wind damage and life-threatening floods. The US National Hurricane Center reports maximum sustained winds near 220km/h, and forecasters expect landfall soon, with Oaxaca and Guerrero states most likely to be impacted. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum urged residents to stay indoors and heed official communications. Around 2,000 shelters have been set up across Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca, with over 18,000 first responders mobilized in preparation for the hurricane. The storm is expected to be the first to make landfall in Mexico this season, raising concerns following the devastation of Hurricane Otis in Acapulco in 2023.</p>

          <p>Japan is preparing to send two Self-Defense Forces airplanes to eastern Africa to potentially evacuate its nationals from the Middle East amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that two C-2 transport aircraft with approximately 120 crew members will be deployed to an SDF base in Djibouti, following a request from Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. The government is assessing how many of the approximately 280 Japanese nationals in Iran and 1,000 in Israel wish to leave, and has already begun evacuating some by bus to neighboring Azerbaijan and Jordan due to airport closures. Japan's move comes amid heightened speculation about potential U.S. military action in the region.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has cut the VA Servicing Purchase program (VASP), which provided low-interest-rate mortgages to veterans struggling with delinquent loans, leaving thousands at risk of foreclosure. This decision has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, as well as veterans across the country, who fear losing their homes. The VA defends the move, citing concerns about the program's cost, while lawmakers are pushing for a "partial claim" program as a replacement. The sudden elimination of VASP leaves veterans with fewer options than other homeowners facing similar financial difficulties.</p>

Graduates are eager to start their FAA careers, despite the stresses of the job, and the high pay is a major draw.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could destabilize the solar system over the next four billion years, potentially flinging Earth out of orbit or into the sun. Computer simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system underestimate the degree of future orbital changes. While the odds of a collision with Earth are low at approximately 0.2 percent, the risk of instability for other planets like Mars is significantly higher. The gravitational tug from a passing star could also disrupt the orbits of Pluto and Mercury.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are set to sign a peace agreement on June 27, mediated by the US State Department, aiming to end fighting in eastern Congo. The agreement includes provisions on respect for territorial integrity, a prohibition of hostilities, and disengagement and disarmament of non-state armed groups. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will witness the signing ceremony in Washington. Previous ceasefires between Kinshasa and Kigali have failed, but Washington hopes this agreement will hold and attract Western investment to the mineral-rich region.</p>

          <p>Israel and Iran have continued to exchange strikes in their latest conflict, which began on Friday, with angry rhetoric from both sides. The conflict started when Israel attacked nuclear and military sites in Iran, and then Iran retaliated with aerial attacks targeting Israel. An Iranian missile directly hit Soroka hospital in Beersheba, southern Israel, injuring at least 32 people, while Israel said it had carried out an attack on the nuclear reactor in Arak, north-western Iran. The US considers its next move, with President Trump considering the possibility of direct American involvement in Israel's campaign.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has caused a significant spike in shipping insurance costs in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for journeys into the Gulf, up from 0.125% before Israel's attack on Iran. War risk insurance rates have also increased for the Red Sea, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. The reassessment of shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment and concerns about a broader conflict.</p>

Ishiba is trying to balance the need to protect Japan's national interests with the pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the trade deficit. While Japan wants the U.S. to remove or reduce the 25% auto tariff, making easy concessions in tariff talks is not an option before the upcoming House of Councillors election. Without a deal, the economic repercussions will be felt, particularly by smaller suppliers.</p>

Critics say the government has failed to pair the tuition measure with adequate support for struggling public schools, many of which are already facing shrinking enrollment and budget shortfalls. The policy is aimed at easing households' financial burdens amid inflation, but it also risks undermining the role that public high schools have long played as "safety nets" for students with diverse needs.</p>
