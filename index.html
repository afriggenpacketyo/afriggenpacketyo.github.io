          <p>German police are investigating a second arson attack in two days on a major railway line in Düsseldorf, which has caused significant travel disruptions, including for services to the city's international airport. The incendiary device used in the latest incident was reportedly the same type as the one from the previous day's fire. A left-wing extremist group calling itself the "Angry Birds Commando" claimed responsibility for the first attack, stating a desire to disrupt the industrial system. Authorities are treating the incidents as sabotage and are investigating the politically motivated claims.</p>

          <p>Police in Leicestershire have arrested a 76-year-old man on suspicion of administering poison after eight children and one adult fell ill at a summer camp at Stathern Lodge. All nine individuals were hospitalized but have since been discharged. The incident prompted a large emergency response, with locals describing "crazy" and "stressed" scenes as a village hall was used for triage. Leicestershire Police, who received an initial report a day before visiting the camp, has referred itself to the police conduct watchdog for its handling of the incident. The investigation is ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors are now seeking a significantly longer prison sentence for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, arguing that his potential term will be "substantially higher" than the previously estimated four to five years. This comes after his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In a court filing, prosecutors strongly opposed Combs' request for release on a $50 million bail, citing him as a flight risk and a danger to the community due to his history of violence. The judge will ultimately determine the sentence in October, with wide latitude to decide the final term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tax proposal from the Trump administration includes a significant change for charitable giving, offering a new deduction for the 90% of filers who do not itemize. The provision would allow single filers to deduct up to $1,000 and married couples up to $2,000 for cash donations, starting in 2026. This measure is similar to a smaller, temporary deduction enacted during the pandemic, which was claimed by nearly 48 million filers. Financial experts note that taxpayers planning to use this break must still maintain meticulous records, including written acknowledgements from charities for donations of $250 or more.

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone held steady at 2% in July, surpassing economists' expectations of a slight decrease to 1.9%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, also remained unchanged at 2.3%, suggesting persistent price pressures. This data makes it less likely that the European Central Bank will resume interest rate cuts in the near future. The figures arrive as the European economy shows resilience but also faces headwinds from external factors, including new US trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The technique, developed over six years at the University of the Witwatersrand, makes the horns detectable by nuclear security systems at international borders, aiming to disrupt smuggling networks. The process has been confirmed as safe for the animals. This novel approach is designed to protect South Africa's vast rhino population, which is heavily targeted by poachers who sell the horns in Asian markets for use in traditional medicine.</p>

          <p>A Guardian opinion piece by Simon Jenkins argues that while much of what Donald Trump says can be dismissed, his focus on aesthetics is a noteworthy and refreshing aspect of his politics. The article highlights Trump's executive order promoting classical architecture for federal buildings and his vocal criticism of wind turbines for spoiling scenic landscapes in Scotland and the US. Jenkins suggests that this willingness to openly discuss beauty and ugliness in public policy is a rare trait among modern politicians. The columnist compares this aspect of Trump to Teddy Roosevelt's concern for America's natural environment, finding value in a leader unashamed to prioritize visual impact.</p>

The initial deployment of 4,000 soldiers and 700 Marines in June was met with strong opposition from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued to end what he termed "political theater." Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the withdrawal as a "win for Los Angeles," stating the troops were used as props instead of addressing real emergencies.

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized its new global trade policy, imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to over 40% on nearly 70 countries, set to take effect next week.

However, key partners like Canada and Mexico are still in negotiations, with Canada facing a separate 35% tariff hike, while Mexico received a 90-day extension. The policy aims to reduce US trade deficits by leveraging tariffs as a negotiation tool, fundamentally reshaping America's trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Florida enters peak hurricane season, residents are reminded of the state's "no-fault" tree law, which generally leaves property owners responsible for damage caused by a neighbor's fallen tree. Under the current "Massachusetts Rule," if a tree falls due to a natural event or "act of God," the owner of the damaged property must cover the cleanup and repair costs through their own insurance. The tree's owner is typically only liable if negligence, such as ignoring a dead or hazardous tree, can be proven. Recent legislative efforts to shift liability to the tree's owner, known as the "Fallen Tree Act," failed to pass this year.</p>

The company also stated that potential US tariffs are not expected to have a significant impact on its earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC is facing growing calls from unions and women's rights groups to cancel the broadcast of the new MasterChef series, which was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were sacked. The sackings followed an investigation that upheld over 40 complaints of misconduct against Wallace and a claim of racist language against Torode. While the BBC consulted contestants and stated there was support for airing the show, critics argue that broadcasting it rewards bad behavior and is distressing for the complainants. One contestant has already been edited out at her request after she objected to the broadcast.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has been notified that the federal government is suspending some of its research funding due to allegations of "antisemitism and bias" on campus. According to the university's chancellor, the decision could affect hundreds of grants from agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. The move follows a recent $6 million settlement UCLA paid to Jewish students over claims that pro-Palestinian protests had blocked their access to campus. The chancellor called the penalty disappointing and stated that defunding life-saving research does nothing to address the underlying issue of discrimination.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves by boosting the number of working-class entrants. Participants who perform well in the paid summer internship will be fast-tracked in the selection process for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move is part of a broader government initiative to diversify talent and establish more career paths outside of London.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's Congress, dominated by President Nayib Bukele's Nuevas Ideas party, has approved constitutional reforms that permit indefinite presidential reelection. The changes also extend the presidential term from five to six years and were passed with a supermajority vote. This move solidifies Bukele's grip on power, allowing him to run for office without term limits, a practice seen in only a few other Latin American countries like Venezuela and Nicaragua. The reform has been condemned by opposition parties and civil society organizations as a severe blow to democracy and a step toward authoritarianism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court is set to issue a landmark ruling that could allow millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance deals. The case centers on whether hidden commissions paid by lenders to car dealers, which often incentivized higher interest rates for customers, were unlawful. These "discretionary commission arrangements" were banned in 2021, but the court's decision could apply more broadly, potentially triggering billions of pounds in payouts similar to the PPI scandal. Lenders have set aside significant funds in anticipation, while the government has expressed concern over the potential economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, the Chinese embassy in Wellington strongly opposed the "groundless assertions" and "vilification against China," attributing the move to a "Cold War mentality."

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its chips contain "back doors" after being summoned by China's cyberspace regulator over security concerns. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) interviewed company representatives about potential tracking and remote control functions in its H20 chips, which were specifically designed to comply with US export controls for the Chinese market. In its response, Nvidia stated that cybersecurity is critically important and that its products do not allow for remote access or control. The move by Beijing highlights the immense challenge Nvidia faces in navigating the deepening technological rivalry between the US and China.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide this year, has expressed shock at President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that he became upset with Epstein after the financier "stole" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, Giuffre's family called the remark shocking and demanded answers, emphasizing that their sister was "preyed upon," not stolen like an object. The development adds another layer to the complex relationship between Trump and Epstein and comes as Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell has reportedly been interviewed by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A new law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed in 2022, has come into effect in the UK, banning the manufacture, sale, and possession of ninja swords. The campaign for the law was led by Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, after her son was killed in a case of mistaken identity by a teenager who had easily purchased the weapon online. The law, which also requires retailers to report suspicious knife orders, is part of a broader government effort to combat knife crime. A month-long surrender scheme preceding the ban saw over 1,000 of the weapons removed from the streets.</p>
