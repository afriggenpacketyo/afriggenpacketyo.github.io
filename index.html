The company's CEO described the fiscal second quarter as "challenging," citing difficult market conditions and inventory depreciation as key factors for the lackluster performance. This significant downturn at CarMax, often viewed as a market barometer, also negatively impacted the stock prices of other major vehicle retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to approve a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new structure involving American company Oracle. The agreement aims to address national security concerns by having Oracle host U.S. user data and review the app's code, while a consortium of American investors will take a stake in the company. The deal is structured as a "qualified divestiture" to comply with a law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sever ties, though some lawmakers remain concerned about potential lingering influence.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is ending its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks, mandating a shift to electronic payments via direct deposit or prepaid debit cards starting September 30. The agency states this move will enhance efficiency and security, noting that electronic transfers are significantly less likely to be lost or stolen and are more cost-effective. While exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means to receive payments, the transition has raised concerns for unbanked seniors who rely on the traditional check system.</p>

          <p>In a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Donald Trump urged Turkey to stop purchasing oil from Russia to help cut off Moscow's energy funding amid the war in Ukraine. The discussion took place as Erdogan seeks to finalize a deal to acquire advanced F-35 fighter jets, a purchase previously blocked due to Turkey's acquisition of a Russian air defense system. While Trump expressed optimism about resolving the F-35 issue and lifting sanctions, no firm commitments were made during the meeting.</p>

          <p>Major streaming services, including Disney+, Apple TV+, and Netflix, have recently increased their subscription prices, causing frustration among consumers who initially sought to escape high cable costs. This trend reflects a shift in the industry's business model, as companies grapple with high content production costs and subscriber churn. Analysts note that the market is evolving, with some companies bundling services like traditional cable, while consumers, particularly younger generations, are becoming more flexible and content-driven in their subscription choices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated national security investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and a wide range of medical devices, from surgical masks to pacemakers. These "Section 232" probes by the Department of Commerce could pave the way for new tariffs aimed at boosting domestic production of goods deemed critical to national security. The move has raised concerns among industry groups about potential cost increases for consumers, hospitals, and manufacturers who rely on global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy is set to become the first former French president to be imprisoned after receiving a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy related to the "Libyan money" trial. While cleared of several other charges, the court convicted him of "criminal association" and ordered that the sentence not be suspended pending appeal, a decision that has reignited fierce political divisions. Sarkozy's supporters claim he is a victim of judicial and media bias, while opponents view the verdict as accountability for a long history of pushing legal boundaries.</p>

According to state officials, the individuals "had to fight off the bear" during the encounter on the Exit Glacier Trail, which has since been closed for assessment by wildlife biologists. Park guidelines advise visitors to give bears ample space and, if attacked by a brown bear, to play dead unless the attack persists, at which point they should fight back vigorously.</p>

This advancement could lead to increased trading margins and greater market liquidity by more accurately estimating the likelihood of a trade being filled at a quoted price.
