          <p>CVS Health reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue, leading to an increase in its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $6 to $6.20 per share. The company's insurance business, Aetna, showed signs of improvement with a decrease in the medical benefit ratio, reflecting stronger performance in the Medicare business and improved Medicare Advantage star ratings. CEO David Joyner mentioned that CVS is closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals, while also noting that the majority of retail products are sourced in the U.S., which could be advantageous. However, the company is maintaining a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year due to continued higher medical costs and potential macro headwinds.</p>

          <p>General Motors has revised its 2025 earnings guidance, factoring in a potential $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs. The Detroit automaker now anticipates adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to range between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, a decrease from the initial forecast of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. CEO Mary Barra stated that the company is actively working to mitigate these increased costs by strengthening the supply base and driving EV profitability, while also leveraging their existing manufacturing footprint to add capacity efficiently and quickly in the U.S. The revised guidance considers the positive impacts of recent tariff changes, including reimbursements for some U.S. parts and reduced tariff stacking.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh in on Whether Pronatalist Policies Benefit Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 07:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of pronatalist policies, particularly those aimed at increasing birth rates, for children themselves. Experts suggest that policies like direct financial support to parents, similar to the expanded child tax credit during the Biden administration, could significantly improve children's well-being by alleviating financial strain and providing stability. While some argue that a larger population could foster a more child-friendly society with increased tolerance and resources, others caution that pronatalism can reinforce patriarchal values and may not always lead to better outcomes for children. Ultimately, experts emphasize the importance of ensuring children's basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare, and education, are met to create a truly pro-child environment.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported first-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded expectations, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to its acquisition of an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing drugmakers to invest in U.S. manufacturing, aligning with the Trump administration's goals. Mounjaro's revenue reached $3.84 billion, while Zepbound generated $2.31 billion in sales, demonstrating the significant impact of these treatments on the company's financial performance.</p>

The FA stated that only individuals born biologically female will be permitted to participate in women's football at all levels. The FA amended its rules on April 11, applying stricter eligibility criteria for transgender women to continue playing in women's football at all levels.</p>

          <p>Limestone University, a private Christian university in South Carolina founded in 1845, is set to close at the end of the semester after failing to raise $6 million needed to sustain operations. Despite raising $2.1 million during a two-week fundraising period, the university fell short of its goal, leading to the decision to shut down both its online and in-person programs. Enrollment had significantly declined from 3,200 students in 2014 to approximately 1,600, contributing to the school's financial difficulties. The closure will result in the loss of jobs for several hundred professors and support staff, and the university has promised to assist students in transferring to other institutions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's policies have largely favored the U.S. meat industry during his first 100 days in office, often at the expense of environmental regulations, animal welfare, and worker safety. Actions such as speeding up slaughter lines, rolling back food safety measures, and gutting animal welfare research are highlighted as examples of the administration's support for the industry. While tariffs have presented a challenge, the overall trend indicates a more industry-friendly approach compared to previous administrations. The article also notes concerns about increased pollution, industry bailouts, and the influence of large meat companies like JBS.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank will continue to pursue interest rate hikes despite economic uncertainties arising from U.S. tariffs, which have prompted the BOJ to lower its growth and inflation outlooks. The BOJ revised down its forecasts, factoring in the impact of President Trump's tariffs, though Ueda acknowledged the difficulty in fully reflecting these effects in projections. The BOJ maintained its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent and now expects to stably achieve its 2 percent inflation target in the latter half of the three years through March 2028. Ueda indicated that potential shifts in U.S. trade policy could either accelerate or delay the next rate hike.</p>

          <p>This article details the Trump administration's rapid and extensive efforts to undo environmental regulations, with 145 actions taken in the first 100 days of the second term, surpassing the total rollbacks of the entire first term. These actions favor the fossil fuel industry and weaken protections for clean air, water, and climate. The administration's aggressive stance has been criticized for skirting the law and defying norms, leading to legal challenges and concerns about the long-term consequences for the environment and public health. The article also notes the administration's attempts to limit the use of terms related to pollution and climate change in government documents.</p>

          <p>This article highlights five players who made significant contributions to Chelsea's latest WSL title success but may not have received as much attention as the team's star players. One such player is Sandy Baltimore, a summer signing from Paris St-Germain, who impressed in her debut season as a left wing-back. Despite playing in a different position than she was used to, Baltimore's consistent performances kept England left-back Niamh Charles out of the team. Manager Bompastor praised Baltimore's defensive skills and ability to contribute to the team's attacking play.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen a significant shift in the administration's stance on cryptocurrency, with the industry celebrating a "180 pivot" from the Biden years. Actions such as creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, rolling back SEC enforcement tactics, and appointing pro-crypto officials have been welcomed by the crypto community. However, concerns remain regarding the president's involvement in meme coins and his family's participation in crypto projects. The industry is also waiting for further action from the Federal Reserve to ease restrictions on banks working with crypto firms.</p>

The agreement, which involves creating a joint investment fund between the countries, is intended to give President Trump a personal stake in the country’s fate while addressing his concerns that the United States has provided Kyiv with a blank check to try to withstand Russia’s invasion.</p>
