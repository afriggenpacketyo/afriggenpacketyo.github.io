          <p>A federal judge is demanding clarity from the Justice Department regarding its plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was previously deported by mistake and then returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. His lawyers argue his prolonged detention is illegal, citing a Supreme Court ruling against indefinite confinement for individuals awaiting removal. The case is complicated by an ongoing government shutdown, which the administration's attorneys claim has hindered their ability to provide details on the proposed deportation to Eswatini. The judge has ordered a witness with direct knowledge to testify, seeking answers on the government's next steps.</p>

The quakes caused significant damage, including a collapsed mining tunnel that killed three miners, and structural damage to buildings and a hospital. Hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded, leaving residents shaken and causing widespread power outages in some areas. Authorities are assessing the full extent of the damage as rescue and recovery efforts continue in the region, which is located on the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire."</p>

          <p>The White House criticized the Nobel Committee for not awarding the Peace Prize to former President Donald Trump, claiming the decision was politically motivated. In a notable turn, the 2025 prize recipient, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, publicly thanked Trump for his support of her efforts to promote democracy in her country. She dedicated the award in part to him, highlighting his role as a key ally in her cause. This development occurred shortly after a White House spokesperson accused the committee of placing "politics over peace" by overlooking Trump's claims of ending multiple wars.</p>

          <p>Democrats in Virginia are navigating a difficult situation regarding their attorney general candidate, Jay Jones, following the emergence of violent text messages he sent. While many in the party have condemned the messages, they have been hesitant to call for his withdrawal from the race against incumbent Jason Miyares. Virginia election law presents a major hurdle, as the deadline to replace a candidate's name on the ballot has passed, and early voting is already underway. If Jones were to withdraw now, his name would remain on the ballot, and Democrats would have to rely on a challenging write-in campaign for a replacement.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index for October shows that U.S. consumer confidence has fallen for the third consecutive month, reaching a five-month low. Americans are expressing growing concern over stubbornly high inflation and a weakening job market, with a significant percentage of households expecting unemployment to rise. While some data, like credit card spending, shows continued economic resilience, the overall sentiment reflects a bleak outlook for the near future. The ongoing government shutdown has also delayed the release of other key economic indicators, adding to the uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fayaz Khan, a 26-year-old Afghan migrant, has been found guilty of threatening to kill Reform UK leader Nigel Farage in a video posted on TikTok. The video was a response to a YouTube segment by Farage that featured Khan's journey to the UK. In his post, Khan used gun gestures and referenced an AK-47 tattoo on his face, which Farage testified was "pretty chilling." The prosecution argued the video was a "sinister and menacing" threat, while the defense claimed it was Khan's "idiosyncratic, moronic, comedic" online persona and not a genuine threat. Khan is scheduled for sentencing next month.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Labor Department has announced it will bring back staff to continue working on the September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, despite the ongoing government shutdown. This decision was made because the Social Security Administration requires the third-quarter CPI data to calculate its annual cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries by a November 1 deadline. While work on the crucial inflation gauge will resume, other key economic data releases, such as the nonfarm payroll report, remain delayed due to the lapse in federal funding.

Following the ouster of Bashar Assad, President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government faces significant challenges in uniting a country with deep ethnic and political divisions, particularly with Kurdish and Druze minorities. Recent clashes and stalled integration efforts with Kurdish forces in the north underscore the fragility of the post-war state.

A key detail in the case is that the couple's protective dog, Willow, was in an upstairs bedroom, preventing the detective from entering the room during the initial search.

This potential staffing shortage could result in longer security lines and flight delays, as seen during the 2018-2019 shutdown.

During a shutdown, essential employees, such as military personnel and air traffic controllers, must continue to work without immediate pay, while non-essential workers are furloughed.

She warned that such a move is "unlikely to align" with the academic and non-profit missions of the universities and could potentially jeopardize their tax-exempt status. The conference has been exploring a deal that could involve a multi-billion-dollar investment in exchange for a stake in a new entity managing its media rights. Cantwell's letter raises concerns that revenue generated through a for-profit investor may no longer be considered substantially related to the universities' educational purpose.</p>

          <p>A recent HSBC survey reveals that 57% of entrepreneurs with at least $2 million in investable assets are considering moving to a new country within the next year. Contrary to common belief, tax efficiency was not a primary motivator, ranking behind factors like business expansion, new investment opportunities, and improved quality of life. Singapore was the top-ranked potential destination, followed by the UK, Japan, and Switzerland. The survey indicates a growing trend of global mobility among the wealthy, driven more by strategic business goals and lifestyle improvements than by tax avoidance.</p>

          <p>Alfie Franco, 20, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 23 years for the murder of 16-year-old Syrian refugee Ahmad Mamdouh Al Ibrahim. Franco stabbed the teenager with a flick knife in a busy Huddersfield town center following a minor, incidental contact between Ahmad and Franco's girlfriend. The court heard that Ahmad, who had recently moved to the UK to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor, was no threat to Franco. The judge dismissed Franco's claim of self-defense as a lie, highlighting the "unimaginable" loss suffered by the victim's family.</p>

          <p>New U.S. port fees targeting Chinese-built and Chinese-operated freight vessels are set to take effect, causing significant confusion and concern within the global shipping industry. Carriers are scrambling to understand how the rules will be applied, particularly whether having vessel financing through Chinese lessors will subject them to the hefty fees. The lack of clarity from the U.S. Trade Representative has prompted some shipowners to review their financing deals and seek non-Chinese alternatives to avoid potential financial penalties. The fees are part of escalating trade tensions, with China having already enacted its own retaliatory port fees on U.S.-flagged ships.</p>

The report highlights how criminals exploit gaps in international regulations and supply chains to introduce these poisons. Experts warn that without stronger international legal frameworks and stricter enforcement in manufacturing hubs like India, the problem will persist.</p>

The index, which evaluated 65 countries, found that Europe is the leading destination, with nine of the top ten spots located on the continent.

Farmers emphasize that they would much prefer stable orders from China and other markets over subsidies, which they see as a temporary fix. They are urging the Trump administration to take decisive action to "make China buy" U.S. agricultural products again to avoid further economic hardship in the farming sector.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to begin a phased rollout of its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU travelers this autumn, starting this Sunday. The system, which will apply to 29 European countries in the Schengen Area, will replace passport stamping with a digital record of entries and exits. On their first use, travelers from countries like the UK will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, at automated kiosks or with a border officer. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel long-term, officials have expressed concerns about potential delays and queues during the initial registration period.</p>
