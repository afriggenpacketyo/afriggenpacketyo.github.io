The puppies have been given bakery-themed names like Biscuit, Cocoa, and Pretzel. Staff were surprised by the size of the litter, as counting during pregnancy is challenging. Leamington Spa serves as the charity's national base and hosts the world's largest breeding program for assistance dogs. These puppies will soon be placed with volunteer raisers across the UK, embarking on a journey to become life-changing guide dogs by 2027.</p>

          <p>The UK government and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) face intense scrutiny and a new parliamentary inquiry following the collapse of a high-profile China spying case. Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins' witness statements, now published, explicitly state China is conducting "large scale espionage" against the UK, contradicting the CPS's decision to drop the case. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer ordered the statements' release to clarify the situation, while the opposition accuses the government of political interference to protect economic ties with China.

          <p>A Cerulli Associates survey reveals that only 27% of future inheritors plan to keep their benefactor's wealth advisor, a figure that drops to 20% for those who have already inherited. The primary reasons cited are already having their own advisor or lacking a relationship with the benefactor's advisor. Wealthy benefactors, surprisingly, are largely ambivalent about this, with over half unsure or leaving the decision to their heirs. The article suggests this disconnect stems from clients' reluctance to discuss estate plans with their families, limiting advisors' opportunities to build relationships with the next generation.

          <p>German prosecutors have charged a 21-year-old German-Iranian man, known as "White Tiger," with hundreds of crimes, including murder, in connection with a 13-year-old American boy's livestreamed suicide. The man allegedly victimized over 30 children worldwide through an online sexual assault network called "764," coercing them into producing pornographic content and self-harm. Authorities said the crimes occurred between 2021 and 2023, with the suspect denying all charges. The case has prompted questions about German authorities' response time, as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children had alerted them to "White Tiger" in 2021.</p>

          <p>Instagram is introducing new default "PG-13" content settings for teen accounts and exploring a TV app, reflecting a broader trend where "everything is television." This shift highlights the challenge of regulating digital media, which, unlike traditional TV, lacks a single policing agency. The article discusses the growing push for a "three internets" model (PG, PG-13, R) requiring robust age verification, which remains problematic due to free speech concerns, security risks, and ease of circumvention. While these efforts aim to protect children and improve online safety, the article questions the feasibility of creating a truly age-appropriate digital environment.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz outlined Germany's potential role in Gaza's future following the ceasefire, emphasizing humanitarian aid and reconstruction rather than military involvement. Germany has pledged €29 million for immediate aid and plans a nine-figure sum for reconstruction, with Berlin co-hosting a donor conference with Egypt. The article notes that many details of the Trump peace plan remain unclear, and a renewed debate over arms shipments to Israel has emerged within Germany.

The article highlights Uruguay's reputation as a socially liberal nation, having previously legalized marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion.

          <p>Hamas has violently reasserted control in Gaza post-ceasefire, executing rivals and alleged Israeli spies, underscoring significant challenges to its disarmament as stipulated by the Trump peace plan. The group, with an estimated 40,000 fighters, is visibly reappearing on Gaza's streets. While US President Trump has made contradictory statements about temporary rearmament, he recently doubled down on forced disarmament if necessary. Experts believe Hamas views its weapons as essential for its existence, making voluntary disarmament unlikely without substantial political concessions.
