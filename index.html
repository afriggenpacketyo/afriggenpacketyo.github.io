        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. This sentiment is fueled by concerns over Musk's controversial political activities, including his support for President Trump and Republican policies, leading to protests at Tesla locations. The survey highlights a significant divide, with Democrats and young people expressing more positive views towards electric vehicles in general but negative opinions specifically towards Tesla. Republicans, conversely, are more favorable towards Tesla but less so towards EVs, creating a complex challenge for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs will significantly hinder global economic growth, projecting a decrease to 2.8% in 2025. The IMF's report highlights that the tariffs, particularly those between the U.S. and China, are reducing bilateral trade and impacting global trade growth. Rising bond yields and global tensions are also contributing to increased financial instability, with emerging market economies facing higher borrowing costs. The IMF has lowered Germany's economic growth forecast to 0.0% for 2025, while Mexico has rejected the IMF's pessimistic projections for its economy.</p>
