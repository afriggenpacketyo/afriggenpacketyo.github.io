        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An annual report assessing Germany 35 years after reunification highlights the persistent gap between the former East and West, particularly for younger generations. The report emphasizes that while Germany is formally unified, young people in the East still identify strongly with their regional background, or 'Ossis,' due to differing upbringing conditions. Lower incomes, fewer public services in rural areas, and less inherited wealth contribute to these disparities. The report suggests a need for serious debate on inheritance laws to address wealth inequality, as the East continues to lag behind the West in economic development, despite progress in renewable energy and start-ups. 65</p>

          <p>The Singapore Grand Prix not only benefits Singaporean businesses but also boosts tourism in other Asia-Pacific countries. Flight booking data reveals that many travelers combine their Singapore trip with visits to destinations like Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia. Travel websites are offering packages that bundle the F1 race with island getaways in Southeast Asia. This trend extends beyond Singapore, as other Formula One races in the region also generate tourism revenue for neighboring areas, with attendees often venturing to other cities and regions after the race, indicating a broader positive impact on the regional economy. 75</p>

          <p>Drone sightings near Munich airport on Thursday evening led to the suspension of air traffic, causing significant disruptions for nearly 3,000 passengers. Seventeen flights were canceled, and fifteen arriving flights were diverted to other airports, including Stuttgart and Frankfurt. German police searched the area but found no suspicious individuals, prompting the airport to reopen later on Friday. This incident follows similar airport closures in Denmark and Norway due to drone sightings, raising concerns about airport security and the increasing prevalence of unauthorized drone activity near critical infrastructure. 50</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," has garnered mixed reviews, with some critics viewing it as a calculated effort to recover from the emotionally raw "The Tortured Poets Department". Teaming up with Max Martin and Shellback, Swift delivers catchy pop songs, but some argue that the album lacks the depth and psychological portraiture of its predecessor. While the album is expected to produce several pop-radio hits, some lyrics are criticized for lacking the emotional complexity found in her earlier work, suggesting a retreat from the vulnerability displayed in previous albums. 60</p>

          <p>The White House is requesting that nine U.S. universities sign an agreement pledging to uphold the Trump administration's higher education priorities, or risk losing preferred access to federal funding. The "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" includes requirements such as freezing tuition rates, banning the use of sex and gender in admissions, and capping international student numbers. The agreement also calls for transforming or abolishing institutional units that punish conservative ideas, raising concerns about academic freedom and political interference. 40</p>

          <p>Venezuela has criticized what it calls an "illegal incursion" by US fighter jets into an area under Venezuelan air traffic control, accusing Washington of a "provocation" that "threatens national sovereignty." The Venezuelan government said the planes were detected near the country's coastline. The incident occurs amid heightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela, with the US increasing its military presence in the Caribbean and making allegations of drug trafficking against Venezuela. These actions have been rejected by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who accuses Washington of seeking regime change. 35</p>
