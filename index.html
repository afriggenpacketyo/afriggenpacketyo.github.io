          <p>A group of Just Stop Oil activists were spared jail terms after being convicted of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance for planning to disrupt Heathrow Airport by gluing themselves to the runway last July. The nine activists were stopped by police before they could cause "unprecedented disruption" at the airport. The defendants either already served their time or received suspended sentences for their actions, highlighting the ongoing debate surrounding climate activism and its impact on public spaces.</p>

          <p>Several prominent Republicans have declined to run for key U.S. Senate seats in 2026, leading to speculation about the party's ability to recruit competitive candidates. High-profile figures like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and former New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu opted out of Senate bids, raising concerns about the party's appeal to centrist voters. Some Republicans believe that loyalty demands from Trump and potential backlash against White House policies may deter strong candidates, while others dismiss these concerns, citing Trump's past wins and ongoing voter engagement efforts. Ultimately, the article suggests that the political landscape remains fluid, and the impact of Trump's influence on the 2026 elections is still uncertain.</p>

Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns that the savings primarily take effect after Trump leaves office. The failure of the vote is a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump, who had urged Republicans to unite behind the bill.

          <p>Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has fallen to its second-lowest level on record, driven by increasing concerns that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey. The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8 in May, down from 52.2 in April, with year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 7.3% from 6.5%. The survey indicates that uncertainty over trade policy is significantly impacting consumers' economic outlook, although a recent pause on tariffs between the U.S. and China may improve sentiment in future readings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of "calling for the assassination of the president" through a now-deleted Instagram post featuring the numbers "8647."

Comey has denied these claims, stating that he was unaware of any association between the numbers and violence and removed the post after learning of the interpretation.

          <p>A recent report indicates that many rice brands sold in the United States contain high levels of toxic heavy metals like arsenic, but experts suggest ways to reduce exposure. Testing found arsenic in all rice samples, with some exceeding federal limits set for infant rice cereal. Recommendations include diversifying diets with grains like quinoa and barley, which have lower heavy metal levels, and checking rice labels for growing regions, as California-grown rice tends to have lower arsenic levels. Cooking rice in excess water and draining it can also reduce arsenic content by 40% to 60%.</p>

Representatives of the crash victims' families expressed outrage, calling the proposal "morally repugnant" and lacking the necessary teeth to change Boeing's safety practices.

This trend is coupled with broader economic uncertainty and concerns about 401(k) performance.

          <p>A new analysis indicates that the Republican tax plan may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, with some lower-income taxpayers potentially left in worse financial shape. The Penn Wharton Budget Model found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026. While the top 0.1 percent would gain significantly, the plan's spending cuts on programs like Medicaid and food stamps could disproportionately affect the poorest Americans, with those reporting less than $17,000 in income seeing a reduction closer to $1,000.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers went on strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday after failing to reach an agreement with the agency over pay raises, leading to a complete shutdown of rail service. The strike is expected to impact over 300,000 daily commuters, with NJ Transit suggesting people work from home if possible. The union, representing about 460 engineers, says that they haven't received a pay raise in five years. The agency is implementing a contingency plan with additional bus service on 19 routes, though it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders.</p>

Epic Games announced that Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it. Apple stated that it asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store. Epic Games submitted Fortnite to Apple's U.S. App Store after a judge ruled that Apple was not allowed to charge a commission on purchases made outside of an iOS app.</p>
