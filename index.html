The flight, originating from Texas, saw the booster make a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico while the spacecraft descended into the Indian Ocean. This test is a critical step in SpaceX's plan to send humans to Mars and supports NASA's goal of landing astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade. The mission included more complex maneuvering tests to practice for future landings.</p>

          <p>The death of Philadelphia schoolteacher Ellen Greenberg has once again been ruled a suicide by the city's Medical Examiner's Office, a decision her family's attorney called "deeply flawed." Greenberg was found in 2011 with 20 stab wounds, and the manner of death has been contested for years, initially being ruled a homicide before being changed. The new report states that Greenberg was capable of inflicting the injuries herself, citing her anxiety, while critics point to evidence they claim proves it was impossible. The family has vowed to continue seeking justice through other avenues.</p>

          <p>Missouri is enforcing a new hands-free law to combat distracted driving, which authorities say is as dangerous as drunk driving. The law was championed by Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was killed in 2019 by a driver who was video chatting. To better target enforcement and education, the state's Department of Transportation is now using anonymous telematics data from smartphones and vehicles to identify distracted driving hot spots. This data suggests distracted driving is a factor in nearly one-third of fatal crashes, far more than previously estimated.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill raising the pay for incarcerated individuals who volunteer to fight wildfires. Assembly Bill 247 increases their hourly wage from approximately $1 to the federal minimum of $7.25, although this is still well below the state's minimum wage. These prison fire crews perform dangerous work, such as clearing brush and digging containment lines, and are a significant part of the state's wildfire response. The legislation, which allocates $10 million for the wage increase, follows other reforms aimed at helping former inmate firefighters after their release.</p>

          <p>Following a hostage-prisoner exchange, the next phase of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan faces significant hurdles, including the region's postwar governance and Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm. The plan proposes an international body to oversee Gaza with technocrats running daily affairs, eventually transitioning to a reformed Palestinian Authority, a concept Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has opposed. Key challenges remain, such as Hamas's refusal to disarm and the need for an estimated $53 billion for reconstruction.

The bill's author, Assemblymember Tina S. McKinnor, has focused on racial disparities, citing a report showing lower sports participation among Black and Latino youth.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has expressed concern that the recent market rally was led by overly speculative and risky stocks rather than established, stable companies. Following a market surge on Monday, which recouped some losses from a tariff-related sell-off, Cramer noted that many of the biggest winners were in volatile sectors like nuclear power and quantum computing. He pointed to companies such as Bloom Energy and NuScale Power as examples of speculative names whose rapid gains could indicate market froth. He suggests a rally led by "tried and true" companies would be more encouraging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several leading U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have refused to sign a new Pentagon policy that restricts journalists' ability to report. The new rules require reporters to pledge not to obtain unauthorized material and limit their access within the building unless officially escorted. Media organizations have criticized the policy as an unconstitutional constraint on freedom of the press, designed to stifle reporting on the military. The Pentagon has defended the rules as necessary for national security, creating a standoff over press freedom.</p>

          <p>A UK government minister has stated that National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell made no decisions regarding evidence in the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The prosecution was unexpectedly dropped, leading to accusations from the Conservative opposition that the government deliberately withheld information to "curry favour" with Beijing. The government dismissed these claims as "baseless," arguing the case failed because the Crown Prosecution Service's legal assessment changed and that the issue stemmed from outdated 1911 legislation, which has since been replaced.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans have fired head coach Brian Callahan, making him the first NFL coach to be dismissed this season. The decision came after the team started the season with a 1-5 record under rookie quarterback Cam Ward, bringing Callahan's overall record with the team to 4-19. In a statement, the team's president of football operations said the program had not demonstrated "sufficient growth" and that hard decisions were necessary to meet the team's standards. Callahan was hired in 2024 after a successful stint as an offensive coordinator.</p>

          <p>A significant step in the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan was realized as Hamas released its remaining living Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israel. The exchange prompted emotional reunions and celebrations on both sides after two years of war. U.S. President Donald Trump, visiting the region, declared a "historic dawn" and attended a summit in Egypt to support the ceasefire. Despite the positive step, significant challenges remain for a lasting peace, including negotiations over the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has announced a new initiative to invest up to $10 billion over the next decade into companies critical to U.S. national security interests. The plan targets four key sectors: defense and aerospace, "frontier" technologies like AI, energy technology, and advanced manufacturing within the supply chain. CEO Jamie Dimon stated the move is a response to the U.S. becoming too reliant on unreliable foreign sources for critical products and minerals. The bank aims to facilitate a total of $1.5 trillion in funding for these areas.</p>
