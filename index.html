          <p>A United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Salt Lake City after pilots discovered a crack in one of the windshield's layers. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, examining the damaged windscreen to determine if an object struck the Boeing 737. The aircraft's multi-layer windshield is designed to maintain integrity even if one layer is compromised, ensuring the safety of the flight. The 134 passengers and six crew members landed safely and were transferred to another aircraft to complete their journey.</p>

          <p>A temporary truce in Gaza is under strain after Israel launched air and artillery strikes, stating its forces were targeted by Hamas. The Israeli military reported rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire, which it called a "bold violation of the ceasefire," prompting a directive for "strong action" from Prime Minister Netanyahu. Hamas has denied involvement in the clashes and reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement. The renewed violence has resulted in at least 38 deaths in Gaza and led Israel to halt aid transfers and threaten to keep the Rafah border crossing closed.</p>

          <p>The University of Florida has fired head football coach Billy Napier after four seasons, despite a recent victory over Mississippi State. Napier's tenure concluded with a 22-23 overall record, including a 12-16 record against SEC opponents and a notably poor 5-17 record against ranked teams. Hired in 2022 after a successful stint at Louisiana, he was unable to replicate that success, never winning more than eight games in a season with the Gators. Receivers coach Billy Gonzales is anticipated to be named the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>The anticipated deal for Kevin Muscat to become the new head coach of Scottish football club Rangers has collapsed. Advanced discussions were held with the former Ibrox player, but the move was deemed unworkable due to his current commitments with Chinese side Shanghai Port, whose season could extend into late autumn. This development is another setback for Rangers in their search for a new manager, following the recent departure of Russell Martin. The club remains confident that an appointment will be made soon as they seek to improve their standing in the Scottish Premiership.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Colombian President Gustavo Petro, labeling him an "illegal drug dealer" and threatening to cut U.S. aid to the country. The accusation follows Petro's condemnation of a U.S. military strike on an alleged drug boat in Colombian waters as "murder." In a related development, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed another U.S. strike on a vessel linked to a Colombian rebel group, resulting in three fatalities. This escalation reflects a contentious shift in U.S. anti-drug strategy in the region, moving from law enforcement to direct military action.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul downplayed a personal attack from former President Donald Trump, who called him a "nasty little guy" on social media. During an appearance on "Meet the Press," Paul attributed the criticism to his consistent focus on reducing national debt, a stance he says is unpopular in Washington. Despite the insult, Paul reiterated his support for Trump, calling him one of the best presidents of his lifetime. However, he also reaffirmed his opposition to some of Trump's policies, including the recent military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, which he believes are illegal without congressional authorization.</p>

          <p>Over 91,000 pounds of frozen breakfast burritos and wraps distributed to U.S. schools have been recalled due to potential listeria contamination. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the recall for products made by M.C.I. Foods between mid-September and mid-October. The contamination was discovered during routine testing of egg ingredients from an external supplier. While there are no confirmed reports of illness, institutions are urged to discard the products, which were part of federally-funded breakfast and lunch programs for low-income students.</p>

          <p>American figure skater Ilia Malinin started his Olympic season with a commanding performance at the Grand Prix de France, winning the event by a massive 40-point margin. The 20-year-old, known as the "Quad God," successfully landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, earning a total score of 321.00. The victory extends his unbeaten streak to nearly two years and solidifies his status as a top contender for the upcoming Winter Olympics.

          <p>An investigation is underway after a team of thieves conducted a swift and highly organized robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing priceless jewels from the French Crown Jewels collection. The thieves used a mechanical ladder to access a first-floor window shortly after the museum opened on Sunday, smashing display cases before escaping on scooters in a raid that lasted only a few minutes. While the full inventory of stolen items is still being compiled, authorities have described them as having "immeasurable heritage value." One item, possibly a crown, was reportedly dropped and recovered near the scene.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters, including naturalist Chris Packham, gathered at the Sea Life London Aquarium to demand the release of 15 gentoo penguins housed at the facility. Campaigners from groups like Freedom For Animals and Born Free argue that the penguins are "trapped in a basement without sunlight or fresh air" and have been for 14 years. They contend that since gentoo penguins are not an endangered species, there is no conservation justification for keeping them in captivity. The aquarium responded that the habitat was designed with specialist veterinary advice and allows the penguins to exhibit normal behaviors.</p>

          <p>A 2025 study by J.D. Power has identified the best "mega-airports" in North America based on overall passenger satisfaction, with the top three remaining unchanged from the previous year. The rankings are determined by factors such as ease of travel, terminal facilities, staff, and food and retail options. According to the study's lead, the highest-ranking airports excel at fundamental services like efficient TSA processing and clean facilities, with retail and dining options being a significant factor in satisfaction scores. An expert noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, it has not yet had a major impact on these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>A seventh person has died following a mass shooting that occurred after a high school football game in Leland, a small town in the Mississippi Delta. A 25-year-old woman succumbed to her wounds about a week after the October 11th incident, which also left more than a dozen others injured. The shooting, which witnesses described as chaotic, broke out during a homecoming celebration in the town's downtown area. While a motive has not been officially disclosed, the FBI suggests it may have stemmed from a disagreement; at least nine people have been arrested in connection with the violence.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively banned women's sports, the Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to compete internationally again. The newly formed squad, comprised of players now living in Australia, the UK, and Europe, will participate in a FIFA-organized tournament in the United Arab Emirates. For the players, the matches represent more than just a game; they are an act of defiance and a platform to represent Afghan women who have been silenced and stripped of their basic human rights. The tournament marks a significant step toward the team's official recognition by FIFA.</p>
