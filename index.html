          <p>Virginia Giuffre, who accused Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew of sexual assault, has died by suicide at the age of 41. Giuffre alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein to Prince Andrew, who she claimed sexually abused her when she was underage. Her family stated that she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and that the light of her life were her children. She had previously settled a civil lawsuit with Epstein in 2009 and a sexual assault lawsuit with Prince Andrew in 2022 without any admission of wrongdoing. </p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors by exaggerating his background and fabricating aspects of his biography.

          <p>In Canada's Alberta province, national unity is a key issue in the federal election, with some residents calling for separation due to dissatisfaction with Liberal rule. The separatist movement has gained momentum, fueled by President Trump's comments about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state and resentment over environmental policies affecting the region's oil and gas industry. While an independent Alberta remains unlikely, the issue poses a challenge to the next prime minister, especially if the Liberals win, highlighting the divide between western and eastern Canada.</p>

Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief representative in tariff talks, is scheduled to visit Washington for a second round of discussions, seeking reconsideration of duties on various exports, including automobiles. Trump views the tariff talks with Japan as a top priority and a test case for other countries seeking relief from U.S. tariffs. The U.S. is also exploring alternative reciprocal trade arrangements to potentially eliminate or reduce the universal 10 percent tariff.</p>

          <p>Two foreign nationals have been arrested for allegedly hiring people to harass and threaten a Los Angeles resident who publicly criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping. The suspects, Cui Guanghai of China and John Miller of the United Kingdom, allegedly enlisted people to surveil the victim, install a tracking device on his car, slash his tires, and destroy statues depicting Xi and his wife. Unbeknownst to the suspects, the people they enlisted were affiliated with the FBI. The suspects face conspiracy and interstate stalking charges, and the U.S. is seeking their extradition.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has rescinded a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, now allowing authorities to use subpoenas and compel testimony from reporters. Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the need to stop federal government employees from intentionally leaking sensitive information to the media. The policy allows for subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants, but requires approval from DOJ leadership and advance notice to journalists. Press freedom advocates argue that the protections are vital for consequential reporting and the public interest.</p>

          <p>California is set to introduce a new license plate sequence for newly registered vehicles starting next year due to the state running out of its current combination of numbers and letters. The new sequence will be three numerals followed by three letters and one numeral (e.g., 000AAA0). The change is occurring sooner than expected due to an increased rate of new plate issuances, possibly driven by concerns that tariffs will increase car prices. New vehicle registrations increased by 8.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.</p>
