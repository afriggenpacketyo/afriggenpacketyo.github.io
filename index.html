          <p>Starbucks is set to roll out a generative AI assistant, "Green Dot Assist," developed with Microsoft Azure's OpenAI platform, initially in 35 locations this month, with a broader launch planned for fiscal 2026. This initiative aims to streamline baristas' tasks and accelerate service, aligning with CEO Brian Niccol's goal to reduce order times to four minutes. The AI assistant will provide quick answers to barista questions via a tablet, covering topics from drink recipes to equipment troubleshooting, and future plans include automated IT ticketing and shift coverage suggestions. The company hopes to improve efficiency and personalization for customers by integrating this technology. Optimism surrounds the potential for AI to positively impact customer experience and employee satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted in Los Angeles following Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, prompting a strong response from the Trump administration, including the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines. The demonstrations began after ICE arrested over 40 suspected undocumented migrants at a work site and targeted schools, businesses, and communities, leading to widespread condemnation from local officials like Mayor Karen Bass. In response, President Trump invoked Title 10, deploying National Guard troops without a state request, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has filed a lawsuit challenging the deployment's legality. The situation remains tense, with state and local officials expressing concerns that the federal response could escalate the unrest.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) has postponed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to weather-related delays during launch processing. Originally scheduled for Friday, the launch is now set for June 16, aiming to deploy another 27 satellites into low Earth orbit, bringing the total constellation size to 54 satellites. Amazon is accelerating its satellite deployments to begin delivering service to customers later this year, facing competition from SpaceX's Starlink.

This tool can analyze hundreds of interviews on a single company, providing comprehensive reports in minutes that would take human analysts days or weeks. Kokko emphasizes that AI will enhance analysts' capabilities by providing rapid summaries, customizable reports, and diverse perspectives, allowing them to focus on higher-level strategic thinking.

The Chelan County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) has handed the search over to federal authorities, with the Washington National Guard assisting by providing helicopter transportation to comb through the state’s dense wooded areas. Officials discovered a "large amount of evidence" from Decker’s abandoned GMC pickup truck, including blood samples and personal items, while the coroner’s office confirmed the girls died of suffocation. Decker has been formally charged with aggravated first-degree murder and kidnapping and could face life in prison without parole if convicted.</p>

          <p>A large international study of nearly 300,000 children reveals a two-way relationship between screen time and emotional well-being, finding that increased screen time is associated with aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The study also found that children struggling with social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens, with gaming consoles showing the strongest links to emotional problems. Researchers emphasize that the goal isn't to eliminate screens entirely but to ensure that screen time doesn't interfere with essentials like sleep and physical activity. Moderate screen time, especially for educational purposes, poses a lower risk of social or emotional problems, but children should be encouraged to interact with friends and family to develop resilience.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy is determined to "get my stuff together" at this week's US Open after experiencing a loss of form following his career-defining Masters victory. The Northern Irish golfer, who completed the career Grand Slam with his Masters win in April, has struggled in recent tournaments, finishing tied 47th at the US PGA Championship and missing the cut at the Canadian Open. McIlroy, the 2011 US Open champion, said he is trying to put his Augusta triumph behind him and find the motivation to work as hard as he had leading up to the Masters. He wants to move forward at Oakmont Country Club.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testified that he and President Donald Trump possess the authority to deploy National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere in the country to ensure Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents can enforce the law.

The testimony comes as approximately 4,800 National Guard and Marines are being deployed to Los Angeles for a 60-day mission following protests and clashes with law enforcement. Representative Betty McCollum criticized the decision as premature and escalatory, questioning the suitability of Marines for domestic law enforcement roles.</p>

          <p>The 'Ballerina' movie expands the John Wick universe by focusing on world-building and inventive action, starring Ana de Armas as Eve, a young assassin seeking revenge for her father's death. Despite a generic plot, the film succeeds when it delves into the bizarre depths of the Wick-iverse, such as a cultish village in the Austrian Alps where every inhabitant is out to kill her. The movie features creative stunts, including flamethrower duels and grenade-laden fight sequences, capturing the grim humor and improvisation characteristic of the John Wick series. While 'Ballerina' opened below expectations, it ultimately serves as a junky but fun addition to the franchise, appealing to fans through its expansion of the Wick canon.</p>

The trial, the first of its kind for a former Brazilian head of state, has involved testimony from high-ranking military and political figures.

          <p>Experts warn that dirty hummingbird feeders can be harmful, even deadly, to the birds they are intended to help. If sugar water is left out too long, it spoils and attracts microbes that can cause infections, including candida, which causes tongue swelling and starvation. While not all microbes are dangerous, it is common for individual birds to be sickened by dirty feeders. The solution is regular cleaning, every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in summer, with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also recommended to provide natural food sources.</p>
