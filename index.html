          <p>The Russian military announced that all Ukrainian troops have been forced out of Russia's Kursk region, a claim Ukrainian officials have not confirmed, stating their forces continue to hold back Russian troops in the area. President Putin congratulated Russian soldiers, asserting Kyiv's incursion had failed, creating conditions for further successes in other front areas. This announcement follows Ukraine's offensive into the Kursk region in August of the previous year, where they initially gained control of an estimated 500 square miles, but slowly lost control throughout early 2025. The news coincides with a meeting between U.S. President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the Vatican during Pope Francis' funeral, where discussions regarding a potential deal on Ukraine took place.

          <p>Karen Read's admission during an ambulance ride about having an argument with John O'Keefe is a key point of contention in her retrial for his murder. Prosecutors are attempting to portray the remark as a reference to an argument that led to O'Keefe's death, while the defense suggests it could have been a voicemail or an earlier conversation. A paramedic testified that Read mentioned her "last words" to her 'husband' were an argument, while also stating that he did not inquire for further details. The trial includes jurors visiting the crime scene and examining Read's SUV, as the defense maintains her innocence.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress face a significant challenge in unifying behind President Trump's plan for a "big, beautiful bill" encompassing tax cuts, border security, and potential social security changes. The bill, aimed at fulfilling campaign promises, proposes substantial spending cuts to fund these initiatives, raising concerns among some Republicans regarding the impact on social safety net programs. Differences between House and Senate budget targets further complicate the process, with experts predicting a substantial increase in the federal deficit. The bill's fate hinges on navigating internal divisions within the GOP and addressing the economic uncertainty caused by Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's campaign to combat antisemitism in higher education is being criticized for disproportionately targeting Jewish individuals and organizations who are critical of Israel. Actions such as defunding universities, arresting students, and demanding the removal of professors are ostensibly meant to protect Jewish students, but have often harmed Jewish individuals who express anti-Zionist views. Pro-Israel groups are accused of aligning with the Trump administration's agenda, which undermines free speech and academic freedom. The pro-Israel movement is viewed as prioritizing the interests of Israel over the well-being of American Jews.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr's policies as US health secretary are raising concerns about the future of chronic disease prevention, particularly due to significant cuts in public health infrastructure and attacks on Covid-19 mitigation efforts. These changes include delayed vaccine approvals, clawing back grants for local immunization support, and elevating critics of Covid-19 policies. Experts worry that these actions undermine immunization efforts and the ability to combat infectious diseases, potentially exacerbating the chronic disease epidemic. The administration defends these decisions as prioritizing funding for chronic disease initiatives and ending wasteful spending on a "non-existent pandemic."</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are using buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to purchase groceries, and more are struggling to make timely payments, according to a Lending Tree survey. The trend indicates financial strain among consumers dealing with inflation, high interest rates, and economic uncertainty. A significant percentage of BNPL users have made late payments, and many have multiple loans simultaneously. While BNPL can be a helpful tool for some, experts caution against overreliance and potential mismanagement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's strict immigration policies and border detentions are deterring overseas tourists, leading to significant financial losses for the US tourism industry. The number of overseas visitors has declined, particularly from Western Europe and Canada, due to safety concerns and negative perceptions of the US. Experts predict a substantial drop in international travel spending, impacting various industries from hotels to entertainment. The decline is expected to affect both Democratic and Republican states, with Florida, Texas, California, and New York facing significant exposure.</p>
