          <p>Beijing has warned the United Kingdom of unspecified "consequences" after the British government once again delayed a decision on China's application to build a large new embassy in London. The Chinese foreign ministry accused the UK of politicizing the matter and going against its commitments to improve bilateral relations. The proposed complex near the Tower of London, which would be Europe's largest embassy, has faced opposition due to security concerns, including potential espionage risks. The UK government has pushed the decision deadline to December, stating that national security is its primary concern.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as National Security Adviser under Donald Trump, has pleaded not guilty to 18 federal charges related to the unlawful retention and transmission of classified documents. The indictment alleges he shared over a thousand pages of sensitive, diary-like entries with family members using personal email and messaging apps. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions taken by the Trump administration against perceived political adversaries, following recent indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Bolton's defense maintains his conduct was lawful and that the records in question were unclassified.</p>

          <p>After maintaining a presence for over six decades, CBS News has closed its workspace at the Pentagon, joining other major news organizations in refusing to sign new press requirements. The Pentagon's new policy mandates that journalists receive formal authorization before publishing any information, including unclassified material, a move that press associations argue infringes on First Amendment rights. Veteran correspondents like David Martin emphasized that being physically present in the building was crucial for building trust and breaking stories. The departure marks a significant shift in the relationship between the military and the media, raising concerns about transparency.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey reveals a significant drop in President Trump's approval rating on the economy, which now stands at a net negative of -13, the lowest of his presidency. Public sentiment has soured due to concerns about inflation, job security, and the ongoing government shutdown, for which a majority of respondents blame the president and congressional Republicans. The survey shows particularly low approval for the administration's policies on the cost of living and tariffs. This marks a reversal from his first term, where economic approval was a consistent strength, with independents now leaning substantially negative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown continues with no resolution in sight, as Democratic lawmakers cite a profound lack of trust in President Trump as a primary obstacle to negotiations. Unlike past stalemates where bipartisan "gangs" formed to broker deals, Democrats are reportedly unwilling to engage in informal talks, fearing the president will not honor any agreement reached. They are demanding an "ironclad path forward" on key issues, such as extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, before reopening the government. This breakdown in trust highlights the severe partisan gridlock paralyzing Washington, with both sides appearing entrenched in their positions.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor recounts her experience investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski, a case that led her back to her small Pennsylvania hometown. The story's central figure is Heather Snyder, the victim's ex-wife and an old high school acquaintance of the reporter. Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was convicted of the murder, though Snyder herself was never charged despite facing suspicion from the victim's family. In an exclusive interview, Snyder addressed these suspicions and her decision to invoke her Fifth Amendment right at the trial, adding a personal and complex layer to the true-crime report.</p>

          <p>At its recent meeting, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned of growing risks to the global economy, despite its current resilience. The IMF's Global Financial Stability Report highlighted three main anxieties: overstretched valuations in the tech sector, volatility in government bond markets, and significant risks within the burgeoning private credit sector, often called "shadow banking." IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva expressed particular concern over the non-bank financial institutions, noting that banks have $4.5 trillion in exposure to this less-regulated sector. The warning comes amid concerns that a market correction could be sharp and hit a politically fragmented global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This nervousness follows the recent failures of two US firms financed by the private credit market, leading investors to seek safe havens like gold, which hit a record high.

The prosecution built its case on a large body of circumstantial evidence, including testimony about the couple's deteriorating relationship, a neighbor hearing screams, and a statement from their son about a heated argument.

Critics argue that by retroactively applying new rules regarding contracts for minority and female-owned businesses, the administration is weaponizing bureaucracy.

While he dismissed a potential bout with 20-year-old British prospect Moses Itauma, he stated that negotiations for his next opponent are ongoing, keeping his future plans somewhat under wraps for now.</p>

          <p>A court in Munich has fined Petr Bystron, a European Parliament member for Germany's far-right AfD party, for using symbols of unconstitutional organizations. The conviction stems from a 2022 social media post where Bystron shared a photo collage depicting former Chancellor Angela Merkel and other politicians with raised arms in poses the court ruled resembled a banned Hitler salute. Bystron was fined €11,250 but can still appeal the verdict, which falls just below the threshold for a criminal record. The case is one of several legal challenges facing AfD figures, including separate bribery allegations against Bystron and convictions against another leader for using Nazi-era slogans.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou has issued a strong defense of his coaching legacy amid mounting pressure after failing to secure a win in his first seven games. With the club reportedly considering replacements, Postecoglou delivered a five-minute monologue asserting his identity as a winner and pointing to his recent Europa League victory with Tottenham. He argued that perceptions of him are skewed, referencing how his successful first season at Spurs was later dismissed. Postecoglou vowed that, if given sufficient time, he would continue his career-long trend of winning trophies, asking for patience from the club and its supporters.</p>

          <p>Major European private markets firms, including ICG and CVC Capital Partners, saw their stock prices fall sharply as concerns over risky lending in the US banking sector spread across the Atlantic. The sell-off follows recent turmoil among US regional banks and the collapse of several companies financed through the private credit market. This has intensified scrutiny of credit quality and underwriting standards globally. The market reaction reflects growing fears of a potential spillover from the less-regulated private credit space into the broader, traditional banking system, a risk recently highlighted by both the IMF and Germany's Bundesbank.

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is causing confusion for federal student loan borrowers, though most essential services remain operational. While monthly payments are still due because they are handled by private servicers, the processing of debt forgiveness applications for programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness will be delayed. This is because final approval must come from the Department of Education, which has furloughed most of its staff. The halt in processing could create future tax implications for some borrowers, as a provision making student loan forgiveness tax-free is set to expire at the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Small businesses across the United States are struggling to absorb the costs of President Trump's tariffs, forcing many to take on high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less leverage with suppliers and more difficulty diversifying their supply chains, making them particularly vulnerable to the sudden increase in duties. Business owners report that subsequent price hikes are already leading to softer sales. Economists suggest that the difficulties faced by these small businesses, which constitute a major part of the US economy, could be an early warning sign of broader economic trouble to come.
