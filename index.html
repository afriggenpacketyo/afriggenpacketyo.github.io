          <p>A Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report details a pattern of communication failures and negligence, including requests for counter-drone systems and additional personnel that were not met. It also accuses former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. The findings suggest these systemic issues contributed to a preventable tragedy, prompting calls for greater accountability.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) announced that it has "liquidated" two agents working for Russia's FSB after they resisted arrest. The operation followed the fatal shooting of a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer, Col Ivan Voronych, in Kyiv on Thursday. According to the SBU, the agents had been tracking the colonel and were supplied with a weapon to carry out the assassination. This event occurs amid a backdrop of ongoing covert operations and assassinations by both sides since Russia's full-scale invasion, highlighting the intense shadow war being waged alongside conventional military conflict.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, have reportedly docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic achievement in autonomous satellite servicing and refueling. According to space situational awareness provider COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged rendezvous and proximity operations, appearing "visually merged" for several days. This complex maneuver, which the United States has not yet accomplished, demonstrates China's advancing capabilities in space. The event was closely monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites, indicating the strategic importance of this technological milestone in space operations.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers, aiming to boost adoption rates. While details on potential grants were not confirmed, the pledge comes alongside a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways. The move addresses the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a significant barrier for many drivers. This policy initiative is part of the UK's strategy to meet its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, as current EV sales lag behind manufacturer targets.</p>

Crane was a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880. This unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries even in well-traveled waterways and adds a new piece to the region's maritime history.

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced that its "National No 1 Uranium" project in Inner Mongolia has produced its first barrel of natural uranium. The project, located in the Ordos basin, utilizes a new mining approach described as "green, safe, intelligent and efficient," which reportedly avoids the need for tunnels and does not produce toxic waste. This development in sandstone-type uranium deposit extraction is seen as a significant step that could enhance China's competitiveness in the global nuclear energy sector. It marks a shift from the country's traditional reliance on volcanic and granite deposits in other regions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the five years since the George Floyd uprisings, arguing that the initial wave of corporate and political gestures failed to address the movement's core demands for fundamental economic and political transformation. The authors contend that instead of divestment from policing, police budgets have increased, and a punitive, authoritarian response has taken hold, accelerated by the Trump administration. They argue that while the state has responded with suppression, communities have demonstrated true safety through mutual aid and grassroots organizing. The article calls for continued revolutionary work to build a society rooted in care, not control.</p>

          <p>A 2023 civil rights settlement mandating Alabama to address a raw sewage crisis in majority-Black Lowndes County has been terminated by the Trump administration, which dismissed it as an "illegal" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) agreement. For decades, many low-income residents have lived with failing or non-existent sanitation systems, exposing them to parasites and other health hazards. The settlement had provided federal funds for new septic systems and halted the criminalization of residents who couldn't afford them. Its termination leaves the community's future uncertain and is part of a broader administration effort to dismantle programs aimed at tackling systemic inequality.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly floods that killed over 120 people, this article analyzes Texas's political culture of resisting government spending on disaster preparedness, despite being the most disaster-prone state in the U.S. It points to a pattern of inaction following major events like the 2021 winter storm and Hurricane Ike, where preventative measures are often debated but not fully funded or implemented. Experts attribute this to a small-government ideology and the political influence of the fossil fuel industry, which fosters skepticism about climate change. This resistance to proactive measures leaves the state's growing population increasingly vulnerable to intensifying extreme weather events.</p>

While MLB has the successful World Baseball Classic, the Olympics offer a unique platform to showcase international stars like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge.

          <p>The current season of "Love Island USA" is notable for its increased racial diversity, with Black contestants being a consistent and central presence. The article observes how dark-skinned female contestants have navigated the show's dynamics, seemingly aware of the stereotypes they could face. However, it also criticizes the show for its "mealy-mouthed" handling of racial issues, such as the unceremonious removal of two contestants for past use of racial slurs, which was explained to viewers only as a "personal situation." The show thus presents a more diverse cast while simultaneously failing to engage with the reality of race in a meaningful way.</p>

The hospital has seen a surge in "seriously unwell" children admitted with the highly contagious virus, with 17 treated for measles since June. The death is believed to be only the second in the UK in a decade. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to a decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine, with vaccination rates in the region falling below the 95% target.

          <p>Recent college graduates are struggling to find employment in one of the most difficult job markets in the last decade, excluding the pandemic era. Despite a low overall unemployment rate, cautious employers and job cuts in sectors like tech and government have led to fewer entry-level openings. Many graduates are forced to accept jobs outside their field of study or for lower salaries than they had anticipated. Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York note that while the current situation is tough, a college degree remains a valuable long-term investment, as most graduates find more suitable work within a few years.</p>
