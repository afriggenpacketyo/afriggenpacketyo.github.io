          <p>Tom Dundon, the owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, has tentatively agreed to acquire the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. While the financial terms were not disclosed, recent valuations placed the team's worth at approximately $3.65 billion. Dundon, a businessman with a growing portfolio in professional sports, would take over from Allen's sister, Jody Allen, who has managed the team since 2018. The sale is pending approval from the NBA.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a stern warning to Russia, stating there would be "severe consequences" if President Vladimir Putin does not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine during their upcoming meeting in Alaska. Following a virtual conference with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump emphasized his intent to press Putin on the issue. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, believing Putin is not genuinely seeking peace and urged for continued international pressure and sanctions. Trump also suggested a potential follow-up meeting involving himself, Putin, and Zelenskyy if the initial talks are productive.</p>

The prosecution is being handled under the terrorism protocol, suggesting a terrorist motivation is being argued.

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, strongly criticized President Trump's immigration agenda during a campaign stop on Staten Island. Mamdani condemned the administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, framing it as a punitive measure rather than a safety concern. He vowed to protect New York's immigrant communities and strengthen its sanctuary city laws, positioning his campaign in direct opposition to what he calls Trump's "fascism." The event highlights the central role of immigration policy in the ongoing mayoral race.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt relief options. This article examines the pros and cons of negotiating directly with creditors versus hiring a debt relief company. While handling negotiations personally can save on fees and maintain control, it requires significant preparation, persistence, and knowledge of debt collection laws. The complexities include understanding potential tax implications on forgiven debt and the impact on one's credit score, which can be challenging without professional guidance.

Theologian Dr. Krish Kandiah made the comment in reference to an article where Jenrick expressed concerns about his children living near undocumented migrants from "backward countries." Jenrick criticized the broadcast, stating it implied that parents concerned about illegal immigration are racist. The BBC acknowledged that the language used went beyond the expected scope of the 'Thought for the Day' segment and temporarily removed the episode from its catch-up service for editing.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the White House will request a long-term extension from Congress to maintain federal control over Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. The initial federal takeover, enacted via the Home Rule Act, is limited to 30 days without a joint resolution from both the House and Senate. Trump stated the move is part of a broader effort to address crime in the capital, though local data indicates a significant decline in violent crime over the past year. The president suggested he could declare a national emergency to extend control if Congress does not approve the request.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, is experiencing record-breaking flooding after an outburst from the Suicide Basin, an area dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and forcing evacuations in low-lying areas. This phenomenon, driven by climate change, occurs when meltwater builds up and breaches the glacial ice dam, releasing billions of gallons of water. Although an annual concern, the floods have grown in severity, prompting the installation of temporary barriers to protect hundreds of homes from widespread damage.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge ruled that the suspension of $584 million violated a previous injunction that blocked the government from canceling grants at the University of California. The administration's actions came after President Trump threatened to cut federal funds for universities over pro-Palestinian student protests, which the government alleges allowed antisemitism. The ruling marks a legal victory for the university amid ongoing tensions over campus free speech and federal funding.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Federal Takeover of D.C. Police Aligns with Authoritarian Tactics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force is a move consistent with a fascist playbook, manufacturing a crisis to justify an expansion of power. The author points to official data showing that violent crime in D.C. and other major cities is at historic lows, directly contradicting the administration's narrative of rampant chaos. The piece suggests this action is not about public safety but is a pretext to centralize law enforcement authority, potentially extending it to other cities and eroding democratic norms.</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a provider of AI data center infrastructure, plummeted 18% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss. The company posted an adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, missing analyst expectations, which overshadowed its revenue that more than tripled year-over-year. The negative market reaction also comes as the post-IPO lock-up period is set to expire, potentially adding more selling pressure. Despite raising its full-year revenue forecast, the results and a delay in some capital expenditures disappointed some investors. (not investment advice)</p>
