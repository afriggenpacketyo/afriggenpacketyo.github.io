          <p>China is hosting an aviation management workshop for eight Southeast Asian countries to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, like the C919 jet. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to challenge the market dominance of Western manufacturers Airbus and Boeing in a region that is already a key recipient of Chinese planes. Analysts see this as a timely move for China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac, to leverage growing economic cooperation and establish a stronger foothold in the global aviation industry.</p>

          <p>The valuation of Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social media platform often compared to Instagram, has surged 19% in three months to an estimated $31 billion, according to documents from major investor GSR Ventures. This significant increase highlights strong investor demand for Chinese tech startups, especially as the government signals renewed support for private enterprise. The platform, known as RedNote in the US, is gaining traction as a potential competitor to TikTok amid regulatory challenges faced by the latter in Western markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has formally requested the Supreme Court to fast-track an appeal concerning the legality of his widespread tariffs. This move follows a federal appeals court ruling that found the president overstepped his authority, stating that imposing tariffs is a power vested exclusively in Congress. The administration argues that the lower court's decision gravely undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security, urging a final decision by November to avoid major economic disruption from potentially unwinding collected tariff revenue.</p>

The event, organized by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, aimed to humanize the victims and pressure authorities for full disclosure, as many survivors fear repercussions for speaking out publicly.</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is seriously considering a run for his old New Hampshire Senate seat in 2026, following Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen's decision not to seek reelection. Sununu, part of a prominent political family, is seen by many in the GOP as a top-tier recruit for a state that has proven challenging for Republican Senate candidates in recent years. He stated he will travel the state and listen to voters before making a final decision by the end of next month on entering the potentially crowded primary field.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr must significantly boost deliveries in the coming months to reach their goals of breaking even by 2025. While second-quarter losses have narrowed for these companies, thanks in part to aggressive discounting, they remain under pressure to improve financial performance amid a brutal price war in the world's largest auto market. Nio's CEO, for example, stated the company needs to double its second-quarter sales volume to 50,000 vehicles per month to stay on track, a goal he described as determinedly achievable.

          <p>A news analysis suggests that the recent public press conference held by survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse has powerfully shifted the narrative of the scandal. By sharing their personal stories of trauma on Capitol Hill, the survivors have brought an authenticity and moral imperative to the forefront, moving beyond the political process arguments that often dominate coverage. This development, which saw staunch Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene join Democrats in demanding the release of files, highlights a growing discontent within the president's own base and exposes his vulnerability on the issue.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that China's recent military parade and high-level economic summits with Russia and India serve as a clear message to the world about its growing power. These events illustrate the geopolitical risks of President Trump's "America First" trade policies, which have scrambled traditional alliances and may be pushing nations like India closer to China. The article suggests that while Trump views tariffs as a tool to protect U.S. industry, his strategy could backfire by fostering new international coalitions and facing legal challenges from the U.S. judiciary.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. military missile strike that destroyed a boat carrying alleged "narco-terrorists" in the Caribbean represents a significant expansion of the post-9/11 counterterrorism playbook, according to this analysis. The action blurs the traditional line between military operations and law enforcement, applying lethal force to a threat historically managed through interdiction by agencies like the Coast Guard. This shift, authorized by a new presidential directive, suggests a sustained campaign against Latin American cartels, raising concerns among legal experts about the expanding legal justifications for military force.</p>

The company's revenue guidance for the upcoming third quarter fell slightly short of consensus estimates, and it maintained its full-year outlook without raising it.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members. The court's majority opinion found that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion," rejecting the administration's argument that mass illegal migration constitutes such an event. This ruling is a significant setback for the administration's strategy of using the obscure wartime statute to expedite removals, which civil liberties groups have argued is an overreach of executive power.</p>

The TUC's general secretary argued for a more progressive tax system, suggesting new levies on online gaming companies, bank windfall profits, and wealth itself, similar to models used in other European countries. The Treasury responded by stating the government believes it has already achieved the right balance in taxing the wealthy, but the call reflects a growing debate within the Labour movement over fiscal policy.</p>
