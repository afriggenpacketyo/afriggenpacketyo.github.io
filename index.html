          <p>A federal judge in Boston strongly criticized the Trump administration for violating a court order that barred officials from deporting individuals to countries not their own without adequate notice. The administration deported eight migrants, claiming they were being sent to South Sudan, but the flight landed in Djibouti. Judge Murphy stated the government gave the deportees insufficient notice, less than 24 hours, and is considering criminal contempt penalties. The judge ordered that the men be provided with legal representation and interviews to determine if they feared being sent to specific countries. This New York Times article includes a map showing the path of the deportation flight. </p>

          <p>Chinese drone maker EHang Holdings anticipates that flying taxis could become a reality for public transportation in China within the next five years. According to CFO Conor Yang, fixed-route air shuttle services could emerge by 2030, with air taxi services potentially appearing sooner in cities with adequate infrastructure. EHang has already received certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to operate autonomous passenger drones. Trial flights are underway in Guangzhou and Hefei, with plans to commence operations in designated areas by year-end. The EH216-S aircraft, priced at $331,000, has garnered significant international interest, particularly in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>Following a tornado that killed five people in St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer placed the city's emergency manager on administrative leave due to the failure to activate tornado warning sirens. The City Emergency Management Agency did not sound the alarms, and the Fire Department's backup system was broken. Ms. Spencer stated the agency failed in its duty to alert the public to danger, and the protocol for activating the warning system has been changed. The Fire Department will now have sole responsibility for activating the siren from a constantly staffed office.

          <p>President Trump's crypto advisor, David Sacks, anticipates the stablecoin legislation in the Senate will pass with bipartisan support, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks noted that there is already over $200 billion in unregulated stablecoins, and providing a legal framework could rapidly increase demand for U.S. debt. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins, recently passed a key procedural vote in the Senate. Sacks expressed confidence in the bill's passage, despite concerns from some Democrats about safeguards to prevent the president and his family from profiting from the legislation.</p>

The speaker brought in the president to rally Republicans: Set aside your differences and pass the bill onto the Senate. Democrats are united in opposition, assailing the bill as a fiscal and moral atrocity, arguing that the proposal cuts programs that provide aid to poor people while bestowing most of its benefits on the rich.

          <p>US researchers are suggesting a novel approach to combat malaria: administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes to eliminate their infection and prevent further transmission of the disease. Instead of focusing solely on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, the team at Harvard University has identified drugs that can effectively clear malaria parasites from the insects when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with this drug cocktail. As mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticides in many countries, this new strategy aims to directly target the parasites within the mosquito.</p>

          <p>Some Afrikaners are refuting claims of a ‚ÄúWhite genocide‚Äù in South Africa, despite the Trump administration's offer of expedited refugee status to members of the White ethnic minority. While the administration cites violence and discrimination as justification, Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp argues that Whites remain economically strong in South Africa. Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein echoes this sentiment, stating that racial motives are not generally a factor in the country's high crime rate. The article explores the complex dynamics of race and land ownership in South Africa, and the motivations behind the Trump administration's controversial refugee program.</p>

A Cambridge University study found that alternative scanning methods could triple the number of cancers detected in this group. Dense breasts make it harder to spot cancers on traditional mammograms, as they appear whiter, similar to early-stage cancers. The study tested enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, which detected significantly more cancers than traditional mammograms.

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to push for the passage of a budget package, with House leaders aiming for a vote possibly within hours. House Speaker Mike Johnson called the meeting "productive," but details of the final version of the legislation remain unclear. The president put pressure on members to fall in line, suggesting that any GOP member who doesn't back the bill would be "knocked out so fast." Johnson can only afford three defections in a floor vote, given his slim majority.</p>

          <p>States and cities are bracing for hurricane and wildfire seasons with uncertainty due to cuts at federal agencies responsible for disaster response. The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has left FEMA and NOAA struggling after leadership changes and staffing cuts, according to this New York Times article. FEMA has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, while NOAA has lost about one-fifth. The Trump administration's push for states and cities to bear the brunt of the response and cost raises concerns about the ability to handle increasingly frequent and deadly extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, drawing dismay from officials and residents. The decision comes as Minneapolis prepares to mark the five-year anniversary of George Floyd's killing. Justice Department officials stated that such agreements have tended to be ineffectual, often costing too much and lasting too long. However, Minneapolis officials maintain their commitment to sweeping changes outlined in the federal agreement, despite the Trump administration's withdrawal, according to this New York Times article.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the effectiveness of federal oversight in policing, as the Trump administration retracts its involvement in eight jurisdictions. While some argue that consent decrees are ineffective and impose a progressive vision of policing, others contend that they bring extensive change and set a de facto standard for American policing. Critics like Harmeet K. Dhillon argue that the agreements are based on unrealistic expectations and micromanage local police departments. However, community members often see the consent decree process as helping to restore trust in the police.</p>

          <p>Nike will resume selling its products directly to Amazon in the U.S. for the first time since 2019. The company stopped selling its goods wholesale on Amazon six years ago as part of a push to distribute more directly to customers and have greater control over the shopping experience. Nike said that the company is investing in its marketplace to bring more products and services to "consumers wherever and however they choose to shop." The deal represents a win for Amazon, which has sought to attract more high-end brands to its platform.</p>

Under the terms of the agreement Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a strategically important military base on one of the islands for an initial period of 99 years in exchange for a multi-billion pound payment. The deal previously appeared to have stalled after a change in government in both Mauritius and the US, but Trump has indicated he would back the deal.

Ramaphosa disputed Trump's allegation, saying black people were far more likely to be victims of violence in South Africa than white people.
