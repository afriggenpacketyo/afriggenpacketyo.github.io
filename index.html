          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that Israeli Air Force fighter jets targeted numerous military objectives in Iran, including an inactive nuclear reactor in Arak. The IDF stated that the reactor's structure, crucial for plutonium production, was hit to prevent its future use in nuclear weapons development. Additional targets included a "nuclear weapons development" site in Natanz, alleging it contained specialized equipment for advancing nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as other military production sites. The IDF had issued an evacuation order for the area surrounding the Arak site prior to the strike. Optimism remains low considering the escalation of military action.</p>

"will not hamper" the U.S. unit's business. Hashimoto said that $11 billion of investment in U.S. Steel operations and a golden share issued to the U.S. government are rational conditions. This comes as analysts view these conditions as downside risks to U.S. Steel's management.

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to pay 1.2 million yen in compensation to two asylum seekers, Deniz and Heydar Safari Diman, ruling that their repeated detentions by the immigration agency did not adequately consider their physical and mental health. The court found that some detentions occurred despite deteriorating health conditions, including diagnoses of depression, violating international human rights covenants and Japan's immigration law. Masako Suzuki, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, emphasized the ruling's significance in acknowledging the human rights violations during detention.

          <p>Insiders warn that the U.S. is woefully underprepared for the upcoming wildfire season due to budget and staff cuts implemented by the Trump administration. These cuts have affected agencies managing public lands, creating gaps in the workforce and undermining early warning systems. There are concerns that a new wildfire directive could add more uncertainty during an already critical time.

          <p>The author argues that Democrats are becoming too focused on politics, while many voters are more interested in other things. To win elections, Democrats need to connect with voters through shared interests and hobbies rather than solely through political engagement. The author suggests that Democrats should showcase their hobbies and interests to appear more relatable and engage with voters on a personal level. The author also points out that Republicans have an advantage in media that prioritizes fun over seriousness, such as podcasts and YouTube.</p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), originally designed for diabetics, are now being marketed to healthy individuals by wellness companies who claim they can help identify "glucose imbalances." Prominent figures in the wellness movement, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Casey Means, advocate for CGM use to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. Critics argue that there is little scientific evidence to support the benefits of CGMs for nondiabetics and that they can lead to unnecessary anxiety and restrictive diets.

Despite this, companies continue to explore AI in toys, with Grimes creating a stuffed rocket ship named Grok, which proved to be frustratingly dumb.

          <p>Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel has called on the UK government to support the US if it attacks Iran, despite legal concerns raised by Lord Hermer. Patel argues that the UK cannot "hide behind legal advice at a time of crisis" and should work with allies, including the US and Israel. She suggests the UK could assist the US by allowing the use of its military bases or providing aircraft refueling. The US may want to use the UK's military base at Diego Garcia to launch American B-2 stealth bombers against Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. on June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The name combines June and nineteenth, marking the day Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the Emancipation Proclamation. Celebrations include parades, parties, and cultural events centered on art and cuisine, memorializing independence and the country's foundation on slavery. Despite some corporate sponsors tapering support, communities continue to honor Juneteenth, recognizing its importance in American history.</p>

The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to protect free speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failures.</p>

BYD has been using a growing fleet of cargo ships to accelerate its overseas expansion, with Brazil becoming its top target. They are lobbying Brazil's government to accelerate by a year a plan to increase Brazil's tariff on all EV imports to 35% from 10%, rather than gradually phasing in higher levies.
