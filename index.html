          <p>A criminal referral alleges Senator Adam Schiff falsified documents to secure favorable mortgage terms by misrepresenting his primary residence. The article explores the legal complexities, including potential statutes of limitations and the high bar for proving intentional fraud on federal forms. While labeling the senator's conduct as potentially "sleazy," the author concludes that a criminal indictment at either the federal or state level is unlikely due to legal hurdles and politically unfavorable jury pools.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold have fallen for nine consecutive sessions, despite the company forecasting a nearly threefold increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. Analysts attribute the stock's retreat to profit-taking by investors after a massive surge since its listing, as well as a reset in market expectations. The company, popular with younger consumers for its unique designs, contrasts with China's broader trend of tepid consumer spending on luxury goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration moves to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, which mandates basic protections for migrant children in U.S. custody, attorneys have filed court documents detailing "prison-like" conditions. The filings describe children being held for weeks in unsanitary facilities, denied proper hygiene, and facing neglect, including a child with autism being deprived of medication. Advocates fear that ending the Flores agreement would remove crucial oversight and accountability, potentially leading to widespread abuse and a worsening of already dire circumstances for vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has become the first U.S. state to require social media companies to display a warning label to users before they can log on, starting in July 2026. The law, signed by Governor Tim Walz, mandates a pop-up acknowledging that prolonged use can be hazardous to mental health, similar to warnings on tobacco or alcohol. While tech industry groups like NetChoice oppose the measure and may pursue legal action, supporters and mental health advocates believe the labels will encourage users, especially young people, to be more mindful of their online habits.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg cautioned the Democratic party against aiming to merely restore the institutions and policies that existed before the Trump administration. He argued that the pre-2024 status quo was already failing many Americans and that Democrats must embrace fundamental change rather than just repairing what was broken. Buttigieg also discussed the public's loss of trust in government, citing the Jeffrey Epstein scandal as an example, and called for a "politics of courage" to counter fear.</p>

          <p>Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels, an insurgent group with ties to the "Islamic State," attacked a Catholic church in Komanda, a town in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The raid, which occurred during Sunday worship, resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people, including nine children, according to the UN peacekeeping mission. The attackers also set fire to nearby houses and shops, marking a brutal end to a period of relative calm in the conflict-ridden Ituri province.</p>

          <p>A growing trend in China sees prospective university students prioritizing majors with strong job prospects, such as computer science, over the prestige of the institution they attend. This shift reflects rising concerns about a competitive job market and a focus on immediate employability. The demand for technology-related fields has been further fueled by the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, leading some students to opt for lower-ranked universities to secure a spot in a high-demand program, valuing practical career paths over elite academic branding.</p>

          <p>A video depicting the brutal "honour killing" of a woman and a man in a remote part of Pakistan has gone viral, triggering widespread public condemnation and prompting a government response. The footage shows a woman, Bano Bibi, and her alleged lover being shot by her brother after a tribal council reportedly ordered the killings. The incident has ignited a national debate on the persistence of extrajudicial tribal justice and the state's failure to enforce laws against such acts, with activists demanding systemic change beyond a reaction to a single viral moment.</p>

          <p>In a Guardian column, Nesrine Malik describes the starvation of children in Gaza as a foreseeable and therefore deliberate crisis, criticizing the international community's inadequate response. The author argues that statements of concern and minor measures like "tactical pauses" are hollow gestures that fail to address Israel's blockade, which prevents essential aid from reaching those in need. The article contends that only sustained public protest can apply meaningful pressure on political establishments to move beyond performative scolding and take decisive action, such as ceasing military and trade relations.</p>

          <p>A recent trade deal lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15% offers only limited relief to Japan's carmakers, as they face a much larger threat from Chinese competitors. Analysts note that while the deal provides some certainty, the tariff rate is still high, and the bigger challenge is China's rapid erosion of Japan's market share in key regions like Southeast Asia. China's dominance in electric vehicles and critical components presents a long-term structural challenge for Japanese brands, complicating their outlook despite the resolution of the immediate U.S. tariff issue.
