          <p>Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, has stated that Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek is still significantly behind leading US companies in the AI field, despite recent hype. Speaking at an industry event, Clark acknowledged DeepSeek's technology as 'clever' but noted that its models do not currently pose a national security risk based on internal Anthropic tests. This assessment comes amid speculation about DeepSeek's next-generation models, following the release of its Prover-V2 model designed for handling maths proofs. Clark's comments highlight the competitive landscape in AI development and the ongoing debate about technological capabilities between the US and China.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate panel is set to review cases involving two international students from Tufts and Columbia Universities who face removal from the U.S. after expressing criticism of Israel. The Trump administration revoked their visas, leading to their detention by immigration officials. The students' lawyers argue that their arrest and detention violate the First and Fifth Amendments. The Trump administration has been cracking down on U.S. universities and their students who were involved in pro-Palestinian protests after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House, marking their first encounter since Carney assumed office on an anti-Trump platform. Relations between the U.S. and Canada have been strained due to tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump and his remarks about potentially making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Carney has pledged to stand firm against the U.S. president and will only engage in trade and security talks on Canada's terms. This meeting presents a critical opportunity to address the strained relationship and navigate future cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>NASA officials have expressed support for President Trump's budget blueprint, which proposes a $6 billion cut to the agency's funding. According to a senior NASA official, this reduction presents an opportunity to innovate and streamline operations, focusing on human missions to the Moon and Mars. The budget allocates over $7 billion for lunar exploration and introduces $1 billion for Mars-focused programs, emphasizing efficiency and innovation. The White House clarifies that the budget refocuses NASA funding on competing with China in space exploration, potentially increasing the role of private contractors like SpaceX and Blue Origin.</p>

Readers seeking contemporary fiction with a Dickensian or Dostoyevskian feel are directed to Sarah Parryâ€™s The Essex Serpent, Elif Batumanâ€™s The Idiot, and Tara Isabella Burtonâ€™s Social Creature. The critic also offers recommendations for narrative nonfiction similar to the works of John McPhee.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist argues that the growing political divergence between young men and women is linked to economic shifts over the past half-century. The decline in manufacturing jobs has disproportionately affected men, leading to job insecurity and regressive gender norms. Women, empowered by feminist messages and evolving social roles, have adapted more readily to the cognitive economy. This divergence in economic experiences contributes to differing political values, with men more likely to support right-wing parties and politicians. The article suggests redefining menâ€™s roles in an inclusive way that encompasses caretaking and production.</p>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that the majority of Americans use federal science information, such as weather forecasts and job market reports, on a weekly basis, yet only a small fraction are aware of its origin. The Association of Science and Technology Centers conducted the poll to gauge public attitudes toward science and to inform how science museums and educational centers can better serve the public. Despite political polarization around trust in science, the poll indicates bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity. This article highlights a disconnect between the use of federal science data and the public's understanding of its source.</p>

          <p>The health secretary has acknowledged that restricting winter fuel payments negatively impacted Labour's support in recent local elections, with many voters expressing dissatisfaction with the decision. While the government insists the move is necessary to invest in public services amid inherited crises, Labour lost a significant number of council seats. The winter fuel payment, a lump-sum amount for pensioners, was restricted to those qualifying for pension credit and other income-related benefits in a bid to save Â£1.4 billion. The government is reflecting on the voters' message from the elections.</p>

          <p>A Reuters investigation reveals that a week into Trump's second term, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the cancellation of 11 flights carrying artillery shells and weaponry to Ukraine, costing TRANSCOM $2.2 million. The order caught top national security officials off guard, as President Trump had not issued any such directive. The White House claimed Hegseth followed Trump's directive to pause aid to Ukraine, but did not explain why top officials were unaware. The canceled flights contained weapons approved by the Biden administration and authorized by Congress.</p>

          <p>DoorDash's takeover of Deliveroo illustrates the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets, as companies increasingly favor US listings due to higher valuations and greater financial firepower. The deal underscores a wider problem of companies shunning the London stock market, with UK investors showing less appetite for UK stocks. Despite government efforts to make listing in the UK more attractive, companies listed in the US can more easily expand and acquire rivals. This pattern reflects a broader trend of UK-listed companies disappearing from the stock market.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are weighing whether to end a long-standing practice where states tax hospitals and nursing homes to increase federal matching funds for Medicaid. This maneuver, used by nearly every state, allows states to inflate their Medicaid spending and collect more federal funds. If ended, it could save the federal government $600 billion over the next decade but would disproportionately affect Republican-led states that heavily rely on this tax strategy. The proposal has sparked debate, with some calling the payments gimmicks and others warning of significant budget holes in Medicaid programs.</p>

The board points out that Trump has a history of using outlandish speculation to normalize ideas he genuinely favors, such as overturning an election result. The editorial emphasizes that the appropriate response from the political system, particularly Republicans, is to assert the clarity of the law: Trump is barred from serving a third term, period.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's earlier promise to end HIV in America, his administration's deep funding cuts are rolling back progress in the South, with federal grants being slashed to health departments, universities, and nonprofit organizations.

Despite his exceptional fitness and dedication, the increasing physicality of tennis and the emergence of new rivals like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner pose significant challenges.
