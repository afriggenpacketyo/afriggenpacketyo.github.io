        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a major legislative package fulfilling several campaign promises. The bill combines approximately $4.5 trillion in tax cuts with significant spending increases for immigration enforcement and the military, while also cutting over $1 trillion from health programs like Medicaid. Despite being a political victory for the president, the legislation faces criticism for projected increases to the national debt and its potential to cause millions to lose health insurance coverage. Public opinion on the bill is largely negative, though it finds support among Republican voters.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 U.S. Marines are being deployed to Florida to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with non-law enforcement duties. This move is part of a larger mobilization of 700 service members requested by the Department of Homeland Security to provide administrative and logistical support in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. According to U.S. Northern Command, the military personnel are explicitly prohibited from direct contact with detainees. The deployment is part of a broader strategy under the Trump administration to use military resources to strengthen immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>On the eve of July 4th, President Trump held a rally in Iowa to celebrate the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," which he called a birthday present for America. During the event, he also announced plans for the nation's 250th anniversary, including a UFC fight at the White House and a "Great American State Fair." The president used the rally to criticize Democrats, repeat false claims about the election, and announce a policy shift allowing some migrant farm laborers to remain in the U.S. The sweeping bill itself extends tax cuts, boosts defense and border funding, and cuts social programs.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets, accusing it of large-scale manipulation. The regulator also ordered the freezing of approximately $566 million in alleged illegal gains. SEBI claims the firm used a manipulative strategy involving large stock trades to influence India's Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices, profiting from subsequent options trades.

          <p>An infant in Victorville, California, sustained head injuries after being dropped by its mother during a bizarre parking incident. The mother had allowed her 12-year-old child to move the family car in an apartment complex parking lot while she watched, holding the baby. The 12-year-old accidentally struck the mother with the car door, causing her to fall and drop the infant. The baby was subsequently airlifted to a medical center for treatment. The Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident, which they have referred to as potential "cruelty to a child."</p>

          <p>Veterans' groups and legal scholars are speaking out against the Trump administration's deployment of military troops to U.S. cities like Los Angeles, arguing it threatens democratic principles. Critics contend that using federal troops to quell protests and support civilian law enforcement erodes the line between military and police roles, a situation the nation's founders feared. Advocates for military families also highlight the strain these domestic deployments place on service members and their families. They argue the mission is inappropriate and troops are not trained for community policing.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions now represent the most rapidly growing population in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently detained by ICE do not have a criminal record. This trend contradicts administration claims that enforcement primarily targets violent criminals. The article highlights the case of a Guatemalan pastor who lived in the U.S. for 30 years without a criminal record before being arrested at a routine check-in and deported.</p>

Ethan Guo, 19, was stopped after allegedly submitting a false flight plan and deviating from it, which activated security alerts. He has been charged with violating Chile's aeronautical code. The detention has caused a major delay in his quest to become the first pilot to fly a small Cessna solo to all seven continents, a journey he is undertaking to raise money for cancer research.</p>

          <p>A large explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, have left seven people unaccounted for. The incident at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility in Esparto triggered multiple grass fires and continued to cause smaller explosions from undetonated materials. Two people were confirmed injured, and an evacuation order was issued for the surrounding area. Family members have identified some of the missing as employees who were on-site. The facility was later found to lack local licenses for storing fireworks on the agricultural property.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, who was detained by U.S. immigration authorities upon returning from her honeymoon in February, has been released after over four months in custody. The woman, who came to the U.S. at age eight and grew up in Texas, was arrested despite having complied with ICE check-in requirements for years. During her detention, the government twice attempted to deport her, once despite a judge's order barring her removal. Her case highlights the precarious situation of stateless individuals within the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>Significant staffing cuts within the National Park Service are raising safety concerns as the summer visitor season peaks. At places like Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland, lifeguard towers are shuttered, prompting fears of potential drownings. An advocacy group reports that the Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration took office, linking the shortages to a federal hiring freeze and budget cuts. This lack of personnel, including lifeguards and other seasonal employees, could jeopardize visitor safety at parks across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's direction. The employees' letter argued that the EPA, under the Trump administration, is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment. In response, the EPA accused the signatories of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions. This move represents a significant internal conflict within the agency over its environmental and scientific policies.</p>
