          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," offers a dramatic portrayal of the life of pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr, with Dwayne Johnson in the lead role. The movie explores Kerr's crisis after his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse, relationship turmoil, and the existential dread of no longer being invincible. While the article notes the film doesn't fully explore the emotional depths of the story, it praises Johnson's powerful and vulnerable performance, supported by a strong turn from Emily Blunt as his girlfriend, Dawn.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the CDC have publicly criticized HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating his actions are jeopardizing American public health. In a New York Times op-ed, they cited the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other disruptive policies, such as gutting vaccine advisory committees and canceling mRNA research. The bipartisan group, whose service dates back to the Carter administration, warns that these moves dismantle the nation's vaccine system and weaken its ability to respond to future pandemics, urging Congress to exercise its oversight authority.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has called for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign from his position as Secretary of Health and Human Services, citing his anti-vaccine stance as a public health threat. Sanders emphasized the overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are safe and effective, warning that Kennedy's skepticism could lead to a crisis. The call for resignation follows the controversial firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the subsequent resignation of four other top officials, actions which have drawn rare bipartisan criticism in Congress.</p>

Overcoming a poor head-to-head record against Rublev, Auger-Aliassime's dominant performance, featuring 42 winners, sets up a compelling quarter-final match against Australia's Alex de Minaur.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs, referencing the ongoing leadership crisis at the CDC. In a social media post, Trump acknowledged the debate over the drugs' efficacy and urged manufacturers like Pfizer to release their data to the public to resolve the controversy. His statement connects the turmoil under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including the firing of the CDC director, to the broader national uncertainty about vaccine effectiveness, while also promoting his administration's Operation Warp Speed initiative.</p>

          <p>An analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data reveals that the number of immigrant workers in the United States has fallen by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year. This decline, which includes both legal and undocumented workers, is linked to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies that have slowed new arrivals and increased deportations. Economists express concern that this trend could create labor shortages in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, potentially impacting the broader economy and complicating the Federal Reserve's assessment of the labor market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing tariff conflict between the U.S. and China is directly impacting the American trucking industry by reducing the volume of imported goods that need to be transported. According to freight market analysis, tariffs increase costs for importers, leading them to delay or cancel orders, which in turn shrinks the number of shipping containers arriving at U.S. ports. This downstream effect results in fewer loads available on the spot market, hitting small carriers and owner-operators the hardest as freight demand stagnates and larger fleets compete for the remaining work.

As human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like deer and foxes shrank, while selective breeding and controlled management led to an increase in the size of domestic animals like cattle and chickens.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif is formally challenging World Boxing's mandate that she undergo gender testing to remain eligible for competition. The Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed Khelif filed an appeal after the federation banned her from its events pending a test, a decision that followed controversy during the 2024 Paris Olympics. Khelif, who has competed internationally for years without issue, is seeking to be declared eligible for the upcoming World Championships without submitting to the test, escalating a contentious debate over gender eligibility in the sport.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have arrested a suspect in the assassination of former parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy and claim there is a "Russian trace" in the killing. Parubiy, a key figure in Ukraine's pro-Western movements, was shot and killed in the city of Lviv on Saturday. Police stated the suspect, who was allegedly disguised as a food delivery courier, had carefully planned the attack. The assassination of such a prominent pro-sovereignty figure is being treated by Kyiv as another instance of Russian aggression extending to targeted killings within Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Iconic American apparel company Levi's has warned that "rising anti-Americanism" resulting from President Trump's tariff policies could negatively impact its sales in the United Kingdom. In its UK financial report, the company listed potential shifts in consumer sentiment towards national or European brands as a key business risk. This marks one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly linking the Trump administration's trade policies to a potential consumer backlash abroad, highlighting the broader cultural and economic consequences of the ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's nationalized rail operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, a move that significantly lowers costs for commuters and raises questions about whether the rest of the UK could follow. The policy aims to encourage more train travel, leveraging post-pandemic changes in commuting patterns that have left more capacity on rush-hour services. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided, with some warning that without government investment to increase capacity on busy English routes, a similar move there could lead to severe overcrowding or necessitate overall price hikes.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his legal authority by using emergency powers to impose widespread tariffs on most of the nation's trading partners. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not grant the president unlimited authority to set tariffs, a power constitutionally reserved for Congress. However, the ruling is not immediate, as the court has stayed its decision to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, leaving the controversial duties in place for now.</p>
