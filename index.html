          <p>A top Chinese Communist Party official has cautioned religious organizations to be vigilant against foreign infiltration, echoing President Xi Jinping's call to promote the "sinicisation of religion." Li Ganjie, head of the United Front Work Department, issued the warning during visits to various religious groups. This comes ahead of the Dalai Lamaâ€™s 90th birthday, as China continues to monitor religious matters closely and suppress what it views as separatist movements, particularly in Tibetan Buddhism. The government is wary of external influences that could challenge its authority and control over religious practices.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament narrowly passed a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their lives, sparking both celebration and strong opposition. The bill now faces an uphill battle in the House of Lords, where peers have promised a significant fight. While supporters celebrated the historic vote as a victory for "dignity in dying," opponents raised concerns about the state having "the power to kill." The bill's progress and potential implementation remain uncertain amid deep divisions within the government and the public.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian examines the impact of Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to attack Iran, which he has long portrayed as an existential threat to Israel. The attack has garnered significant support within Israel, but has also sparked a war of cities between Tehran and Tel Aviv. The article suggests that while the attack may provide Netanyahu with a temporary reprieve from his political troubles, it carries the risk of escalating into a broader and more devastating conflict. The author cautions against complacency and emphasizes the potential for mission creep and indecisive attrition.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, often referred to as assault weapons. The bill now goes to the governor, who has expressed support for such a ban. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join a number of states with similar prohibitions. Critics argue that the ban will not curb mass shootings and will only punish law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates call the bill the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>

          <p>A study reveals that visits to locations related to manga and anime in Japan are significantly boosting local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, or 8.1 percent of inbound visitors, visited these sites, a substantial increase from 2016. The phenomenon, known as "seichi junrei," involves fans visiting places that inspired or were settings for popular works. The trend highlights the potential for Japan's entertainment content to offset its digital trade deficit, though it also raises concerns about overtourism.</p>
