            <p>The US is escalating its rivalry with China by approving a US$4.7 billion loan for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique. This move by the US Export-Import Bank (Exim) aims to support American companies in competing against Chinese firms in Africa's strategic industries. The loan guarantees the supply of American equipment for TotalEnergies' US$20 billion LNG project, countering China's initial interest in financing the deal, which the US perceived as a threat to national security. This investment reflects Washington's broader strategy to enhance the competitiveness of American companies against Chinese and Russian entities. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump introduced tariffs on imported goods, including a minimum 10% tariff on all imports to the US, to encourage domestic consumption and reduce the trade deficit. However, economists warn that these measures could increase prices for US consumers, harm the world economy, and potentially trigger a recession. The tariffs, including rates as high as 104% on some countries, have caused volatility in global stock markets as investors anticipate reduced profits. The UK government is preparing a list of US products for retaliatory tariffs, signaling potential trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

The study has revealed insights into the body's reactions, the impact of nutrition and maternal care, and the stark realities of poverty's effects on brain development.

Iran denies having any ambitions to build a nuclear warhead, but analysts fear the country could soon have enough weapons-grade uranium to do so. Trump has restored a policy of 'maximum pressure' on Iran, imposing further sanctions and seeking to punish countries violating existing sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>
