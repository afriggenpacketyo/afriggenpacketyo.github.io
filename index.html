          <p>After days of escalating conflict, India and Pakistan announced a ceasefire, though reports of continued cross-border firing soon emerged, each side accusing the other of violations. President Trump initially claimed the U.S. brokered the deal, a claim India disputed, while Pakistan acknowledged American involvement alongside several other countries. The conflict stemmed from a terrorist attack in Kashmir, leading to retaliatory strikes and heightened tensions over the disputed region, with international concerns growing about a full-blown war, as neighboring countries worked to cool the conflict. This article also includes an interactive map depicting the locations of claimed strikes by both sides, providing a visual representation of the conflict's geography.</p>

          <p>Just hours after agreeing to a ceasefire, India and Pakistan accused each other of violations, escalating tensions despite the deal. India's Foreign Secretary cited repeated violations after hearing explosions in Kashmir, while Pakistan's foreign ministry affirmed commitment to the ceasefire, blaming India for breaches. The agreement followed days of military strikes triggered by a militant attack in Pahalgam, with President Trump claiming U.S. mediation, a claim disputed by India. Both sides urged restraint amidst ongoing accusations and counter-accusations.</p>

          <p>A California girls' track meet turned into a political rally amidst controversy over a transgender athlete competing in girls' events. Three Christian high schools challenged the California Interscholastic Federation's policy, citing unfair competition and religious freedom concerns, as the schools' female athletes considered boycotting the event. The CIF is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for potential Title IX violations, while California Governor Gavin Newsom has acknowledged the issue's unfairness. This article also notes that the majority of California residents, including a large percentage of school parents, oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies, except where legally mandated. This effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon" metric, used to weigh the economic damages from global warming against the costs of limiting carbon pollution. Critics argue this move denies scientific consensus and ignores the growing harms of climate change, while supporters claim the metric is uncertain and an assault on industry. This policy shift could ease the rollback of climate regulations, potentially facing legal challenges for failing to account for climate change.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer characterized talks among Ukraine's allies in Kyiv as a pivotal moment in securing a ceasefire with Russia, although not a definitive end. Around 30 global leaders, including the UK prime minister, reasserted their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening substantial sanctions if non-compliance continues. Donald Trump, in a phone call, also reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire, stating it's a demand that must be met, with assembled leaders warning of new sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin rejects the ceasefire. The Kremlin responded by criticizing European leaders' remarks and demanding a halt to weapon shipments to Ukraine before any ceasefire.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify regarding President Trump's tax agenda, policy experts highlight several key issues to watch. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, which may undergo significant changes before the final vote. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through a process known as "reconciliation," but the limited budget framework and competing priorities could complicate matters. Experts anticipate challenges due to the narrow Republican majority in the House, and the desire of some lawmakers for a more fiscally responsible package.</p>

          <p>President Trump's crypto agenda faces obstacles as lawmakers reject the GENIUS Act due to concerns over his personal cryptocurrency ventures. Critics argue that his meme coin, $TRUMP, and family crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, create conflicts of interest, influencing his administration's approach to digital asset regulations. The GENIUS Act failed to advance in the Senate, while Senate Democrats unveiled the "End Crypto Corruption Act" to prohibit elected officials from endorsing digital assets. Some crypto industry figures express frustration, hoping for legislative advancements and deregulation efforts despite the president's pursuit of personal profits.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is at risk of being labeled "Too Late" by President Trump, mirroring historical criticisms of Fed leaders acting slowly. Despite Trump's urging for rate cuts, Powell is taking a cautious approach, citing a "solid" economy and confident labor market. Economists note the volatile policy mix, with tariffs threatening both growth and inflation, leaving Powell in a difficult position. History suggests the Fed's reluctance to act absent compelling data may lead to missed opportunities, as policymakers grapple with the impact of tariffs and the potential for a recession.</p>

Despite stern rhetoric, both sides have shown signs of wanting to break the deadlock, though neither wants to appear backing down. The talks occur during Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, highlighting China's alternative trade options and global leadership aspirations, as the tariffs are hurting both countries. The uncertainty caused by tariffs has led to economic contraction in the US and hit factory output in China, with both sides feeling pressure to reassure nervous markets and domestic constituencies.</p>

          <p>Heavy flooding following torrential rains in eastern Congo washed away several villages along the shores of Lake Tanganyika, leaving at least 62 dead and 50 missing, authorities said. Witnesses described the floods surging around 5 a.m. local time on Friday and sweeping away the village of Kasaba on the edge of the lake in the Ngandja sector. The South Kivu provincial health minister, Théophile Walulika Muzaliwa, said the rescue operation was hampered by a lack of services and a shutdown of telephone lines due to the flooding. Decades of fighting between government troops and rebels in eastern Congo escalated in February, worsening what is already one of the world's largest humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>Many young Filipino voters are expressing a desire to end the concentration of political power among long-entrenched political dynasties in the upcoming midterm elections. The vote will also likely determine the political future of Duterte's daughter and incumbent Vice President Sara Duterte, who was impeached in February. Despite being in detention in The Hague, his name is on the ballot for mayor of Davao City. A recent series of reports revealed that at least 71 of the country's 82 provincial governments are led by members of political dynasties.</p>

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning, centered near Greenback, Tennessee.

The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, and earthquakes are felt over a much larger distance in the Eastern U.S. due to the region's geology.</p>
