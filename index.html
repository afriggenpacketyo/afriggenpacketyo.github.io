        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump addressed the ongoing protests in Los Angeles related to federal immigration operations, suggesting the city would be "burning" without the National Guard's presence, referencing the January wildfires as a point of comparison. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the protesters were "paid insurrectionists." He also stated he would "certainly invoke" the Insurrection Act if there was an insurrection, defining it as simply looking at the protest site. Trump mentioned calling California Governor Newsom to tell him to "do a better job," which Newsom denied, stating there was no call or voicemail. The situation underscores the tensions between the federal government and local authorities regarding the handling of the protests. Optimism surrounding this article is low due to the political divide and potential for escalation. </p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally requested UEFA to investigate potential breaches of multi-club ownership rules concerning Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League. Crystal Palace qualified by winning the FA Cup, but UEFA rules prevent an individual or entity from holding a majority of shareholder voting rights at two clubs in the same European tournament. John Textor, owner of Eagle Football, holds a 43% stake in Palace and a 77% stake in Lyon, also qualified for the Europa League. Forest, which finished seventh in the Premier League, could benefit if Palace is disqualified, potentially moving up to the Europa League. </p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's tax bill could lead to higher taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries deemed to have "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. This measure, known as Section 899, may deter international companies from expanding into the United States due to concerns about potential tax burdens. The Global Business Alliance estimates this provision could cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually in lost gross domestic product.
