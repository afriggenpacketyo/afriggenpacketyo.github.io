          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he has no plans to communicate with Elon Musk and threatened Musk with "serious consequences" if he supports Democratic candidates. Trump emphasized he provided Musk with numerous advantages during his initial term and doesn't feel obligated to repair their relationship. He also mentioned that he hasn't considered investigating Musk's business dealings or immigration status. The article highlights the escalating tension between the two figures, marking a potential shift in their previously amicable relationship. The context involves political allegiances and potential repercussions for business interests. The optimism score is relatively low due to the adversarial tone and potential negative impact on Musk's businesses.</p>
