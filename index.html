          <p>The Scotland women's cricket team, celebrated as their nation's team of the year in December 2024 after a World Cup appearance, now faces a troubling lack of scheduled fixtures. This situation highlights the financial struggles of associate cricket nations, where organizing matches requires significant funding that Cricket Scotland struggles to secure. Director of Performance Steve Snell emphasizes the need for more support from England to provide regular fixtures for both men's and women's teams. Players express frustration over the limited opportunities to develop and push forward as a team due to the lack of financial support, which they feel they deserve at this point.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan witnessed unprecedented foreign investment inflows into its equities and long-term bonds during April, driven by investors seeking refuge from the U.S. markets after President Trump's trade actions. Data indicates that overseas investors acquired 8.21 trillion yen worth of these assets, marking the highest monthly net inflow since 1996. Analysts attribute this shift to a change in global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading them to diversify into markets like Japan, considered a safe haven. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which could impact the future appeal of Japanese assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family says is mandated by the state's abortion ban. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old mother, was declared brain-dead in February but remains on life support as she is 21 weeks pregnant. The family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected, prevents them from making decisions about her medical care. Bioethicists note that while some states have laws limiting the removal of treatment from pregnant women, Georgia does not, raising complex legal and ethical questions surrounding fetal rights and patient autonomy in the post-Roe era.</p>

          <p>As Romania approaches its presidential runoff, the nation grapples with the potential election of far-right candidate George Simion, a self-described Trumpist, whose rise is rooted in decades of economic failure and anti-establishment sentiment. Despite respectable growth numbers, Romania consistently performs poorly on key social indicators, with a significant portion of the population at risk of poverty. The author argues that the costs of free-market orthodoxy, including mass privatizations and low taxes, have contributed to the country's economic woes, yet mainstream politicians offer little in the way of socioeconomic justice. The election outcome could significantly impact Romania's domestic and foreign policies.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This figure was worse than economists' expectations, as uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. While domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6%, exports fell by 0.6%, offsetting the positive impact. The Bank of Japan has warned that the country's economy is likely to moderate due to global trade policies, but it seems set to continue raising its policy rate if its outlook for economic activity and prices are achieved.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike, halting train service and inconveniencing over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from disagreements over pay raises between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including additional bus service, but it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy suggests people work from home, if possible, and says all options are on the table, even a state of emergency. The strike also impacts travel to the Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium on Friday night.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit train engineers have commenced their strike, shutting down commuter trains and leaving hundreds of thousands of commuters scrambling to find other modes of transportation. A deal was close but not reached, according to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, resulting in all New Jersey Transit commuter trains and the MTA Metro-North West of Hudson service to stop running when the strike began at 12:01 a.m. on Friday. NJ Transit officials have said the strike would "disrupt the lives of more than 350,000 commuters" and developed a contingency plan that includes adding "very limited capacity to existing New York commuter bus routes in close proximity to rail stations and contracting with private carriers to operate bus service" for commuters that typically rely on the trains.</p>

          <p>A medical examiner testified in the Karen Read murder trial that John O'Keefe's cause of death was a head injury and hypothermia, but the manner of death was undetermined. Dr. Irini Scordi-Bello found multiple skull fractures and brain bleeding during the autopsy, with a deep cut and bruising to the back of his head. The blunt impact to his head was the primary cause of death, with hypothermia as a contributing factor. The defense attorney questioned whether the injuries could have been caused by a fall on the frozen ground, to which the medical examiner said was a possibility. The toxicology report found no drugs or prescription medications in his system at the time of his death, but he had a .21% blood alcohol level.</p>

A mutual reduction in tariffs and a respite in the turmoil that has roiled markets since US President Donald Trump ’s return to the White House in January does not meaningfully change a bleak outlook for Europe if it fails to quickly adapt to Washington’s efforts to reorder trade with China and the rest of the world. Europe might not become a pole at all, but rather a shock absorber – forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.</p>

          <p>Australia's most-decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost an appeal against a landmark defamation judgement which found he committed war crimes. A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging the Victoria Cross recipient had murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Mr Roberts-Smith had argued the judge made legal errors. A panel of three Federal Court judges unanimously upheld the original judgement, though Mr Roberts-Smith has said he will appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia "immediately". The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces.</p>

The Japanese firm, which employs thousands of people in the UK, told the BBC it could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally." Nissan's latest job cuts came on top of 9,000 layoffs announced in November as it faces weak sales in key markets such as the US and China. This month, Nissan's battery partner AESC secured a £1bn ($1.3bn) funding package from the UK government for a new plant in Sunderland.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that both conservatives and liberals are engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges to litigate divisive political issues. Conservatives suing the Biden administration often target small federal courts in Texas, while liberals challenging the Trump administration increasingly file cases in Massachusetts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction. The article explores the potential consequences of limiting the scope of injunctions, including the impact on various cases and the erosion of public confidence in the courts.</p>

CATL’s US$5.3 billion stock offer, priced at HK$263 per share at the high end of its price range, is the world’s largest this year, and the biggest sale in Hong Kong in four years.</p>

          <p>Migrating endangered humpback whales are now swimming in the same waters outside the Golden Gate strait where crabs are, and long lines of rope that fishermen traditionally use to pull up crab cages have entangled too many humpbacks. Since 2007, at least 922 humpback whales have been maimed or killed by these ropes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Fisherman Brand Little is able to keep bringing up his catch from the ocean floor because he is using a high-tech system that involves a remote-controlled pop-up balloon-like device that signals the crab cage to head to the ocean's surface. This year, the commercial Dungeness crab season was shortened due to the heightened risk of migrating whales.</p>
