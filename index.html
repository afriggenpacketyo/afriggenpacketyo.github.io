          <p>President Trump announced the U.S. will remove all sanctions against Syria to give the country "a chance at greatness," marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy towards the region. Trump stated that the new Syrian government would hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. Syria has been designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings. This decision is a major step toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in over a decade.</p>

          <p>Peter Coker Sr., an 82-year-old businessman, was sentenced to six months in jail for his role in a scheme to fraudulently inflate the stock of Hometown International, the $100 million New Jersey deli corporation, and a related shell company. The scheme involved artificially inflating the price of publicly traded shares of Hometown International and E-Waste to make them more attractive for mergers. Judge Christine O'Hearn stated that the companies were worthless and that the scheme was fraudulent from its inception. Coker Sr. was also ordered to serve six months of home confinement, pay a $500,000 fine, and pay up to $644,000 in restitution.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government, led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, to give the country "a chance at peace." This effort comes at the urging of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Al-Sharaa, a former insurgent, assumed the presidency in January after leading an offensive that ended the Assad family's 54-year rule. The move marks a significant shift in U.S. policy, putting Trump at odds with Israel, which is skeptical of Al-Sharaa's past and has cautioned against swift recognition of the new government.</p>

          <p>The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April from 12 months earlier, a decrease from March, marking the smallest annual increase since February 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline contributed to the decline. However, economists caution that tariffs imposed by President Trump may reignite inflation. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports, could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800, according to a Yale Budget Lab report.</p>

Kessler, who used these drugs himself, emphasizes that they are not miracle pills and require a comprehensive approach involving diet, exercise, and medical supervision. He notes that the FDA needs to require data on how to safely get off these drugs and how to go back on them safely, as there is currently no data and we are just running a national experiment.

          <p>This Atlantic article discusses the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador, and the Trump administration's refusal to facilitate his return despite a Supreme Court order. The article questions the administration's claims that Abrego Garcia is a dangerous gang member, noting the lack of credible evidence. It argues that everyone, including the undocumented, is entitled to due process and that the administration's actions undermine the Constitution and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A federal judge, Laura Taylor Swain, has ordered that an outside official be appointed to manage Rikers Island, taking control away from New York City due to persistent violence and dysfunction.

This decision comes after nearly a decade of federal oversight and continued failure by the city to improve conditions at the jail.
