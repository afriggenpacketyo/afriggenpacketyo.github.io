          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is projected to make landfall in South Carolina, bringing significant rainfall and potential flash flooding to the Carolinas. As of Saturday night, the storm carried maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and was moving north towards the coast. The National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm warnings for the region from South Carolina's South Santee River to North Carolina's Surf City. Forecasters anticipate the storm will weaken rapidly after moving inland, but not before producing two to four inches of rain, with localized amounts reaching up to six inches.</p>

          <p>A new travel trend is emerging in China, where young university and high school graduates are increasingly choosing cruise ship holidays as a social travel option. Organizers like Dong Wenxin are arranging group trips, finding that cruises offer a unique communal environment for bonding and recreation without the usual constraints of group travel. This boom is fueled by a desire to maintain connections and socialize after graduation, with trips ranging in price and luxury. Analysts note this shift highlights a preference for shared experiences among China's younger generation.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party, named the America Party, positioning it as an alternative to the established Republican and Democratic parties. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump and is framed as a move to restore freedom from a "one-party system" of government waste. It remains unclear if the party has been officially registered with federal election authorities or who will lead it, as Musk, who was not born in the US, is ineligible for the presidency. This move follows a poll Musk conducted asking users if they wanted a new party.</p>

          <p>Rescue efforts are ongoing in Texas after devastating flash floods killed at least 43 people, including 15 children, and left 27 girls from a summer camp missing. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise and washing away homes. Authorities have rescued over 850 people, but the search for survivors continues amid predictions of more heavy rain. The catastrophic event has raised concerns about weather forecasting and emergency preparedness, particularly in a region known as "flash flood alley."</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority across England by April 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a wide range of support services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs, aiming to assist 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. The initiative builds on a previous rollout of 400 hubs and echoes the "Sure Start" centers of the early 2000s. While the government touts it as a way to improve life chances, the opposition has questioned how much of the plan is genuinely new.</p>

Key evidence included Baker's DNA at the scene, extensive communications between the lovers, and secretly recorded conversations where Monica appeared to incriminate herself.

          <p>The first complete photographs have surfaced of a new and mysterious Chinese wing-in-ground effect (WIG) vehicle, also known as an Ekranoplan. The aircraft, spotted on a pier in the Bohai Sea, features a flying-boat-style hull and is similar in scale to China's AG600 amphibious plane. WIGs fly efficiently on a cushion of air just above the water, making them fast, difficult to detect on radar, and immune to underwater threats. While its propulsion system is still unclear, the craft appears suited for logistical support, search and rescue, and other littoral missions in areas like the South China Sea.</p>

          <h2>Peak District Walker Kicks Down Stone Stacks to Protest Environmental Damage</h2>

          <p>A walker in the UK's Peak District is gaining attention for kicking over man-made stone stacks and posting videos of it online to raise awareness of their environmental impact. Stuart Cox argues that building these stacks, some as tall as six feet, damages the local ecosystem by disturbing historic stone walls and the habitats of small creatures within them. The Peak District National Park Authority supports his view, stating the stacks are "detrimental" and that visitors should leave the landscape as they find it. The viral videos have sparked debate but have also educated some on the unintended consequences of this popular trail activity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many young people in the UK are struggling to find summer or part-time jobs, often citing a lack of prior work experience as a major barrier. Career experts advise that applicants can overcome this by highlighting skills learned through other activities, such as volunteering, sports teams, or even home responsibilities. They recommend keeping CVs simple and tailored to the job, showing initiative by approaching smaller businesses in person, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While the job market is competitive, demonstrating teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills can help inexperienced candidates stand out to potential employers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's 'Madman Theory' of Unpredictability Reshapes Foreign Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Donald Trump is employing the "Madman Theory," a strategy of deliberate unpredictability, to drive his foreign and security policy and coerce both allies and adversaries. This approach, characterized by contradictory statements and sudden policy shifts, has been used to pressure NATO allies into increasing defense spending to 5% of their GDP. However, critics and political scientists question its long-term effectiveness, particularly against determined foes like Iran or Russia. The strategy risks being seen as unreliable, potentially undermining trust in the U.S. as a negotiating partner and encouraging allies to seek greater strategic independence.</p>

          <h2>UK's Lifetime ISAs Stir Debate Over Benefits and Penalties</h2>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings product offering a 25% government bonus for first-home buyers or retirement savers, is a subject of debate among financial experts and consumers. While some have successfully used it to fund a home deposit, others have been penalized by its strict rules. Critics point to a withdrawal penalty that can cost savers a portion of their own money and a property price cap of £450,000 that has not been updated since 2017, making it unusable for many in high-priced areas. This has led to calls for reform to make the product fairer and more flexible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that recent cuts to public health and scientific research funding under the Trump administration are threatening progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. While President Trump's first-term initiative led to a swell in funding and a decline in new infections, subsequent cuts have impacted key areas, particularly research into an HIV vaccine and cure. Dr. John Brooks, a former CDC official, expressed concern that the administration's new focus is too narrow on treatment, neglecting the vital role of prevention, which could lead to an increase in new HIV infections nationally.</p>
