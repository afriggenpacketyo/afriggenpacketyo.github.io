          <p>Canada is holding a federal election on April 28th after Prime Minister Mark Carney called a snap vote following former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation.

The election was triggered early due to increasing political tensions including a trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs on the country, with voters focused on economic issues, the cost of living, and housing affordability.</p>

          <p>Budget cuts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are raising concerns about the future of medical research and innovation in the United States. The cuts have led to the termination of research grants and employee layoffs, potentially slowing progress on critical therapies and contributing to a "brain drain" of scientists leaving the country. These actions could have long-term consequences for American health and the nation's position as a leader in biomedical research.</p>

          <p>The U.S. birth rate is declining, raising concerns about potential economic consequences such as a smaller workforce and strain on social security and elder care systems. While factors like increased use of contraception and women delaying marriage contribute to the trend, economic uncertainty and childcare costs also play a role. Experts suggest that policies supporting families, such as affordable childcare and paid family leave, along with immigration and technological advancements, could help mitigate the negative impacts of the declining birth rate.</p>
