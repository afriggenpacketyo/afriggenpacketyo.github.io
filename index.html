            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House violated the First Amendment by barring Associated Press reporters from press events in the Oval Office and on Air Force One after the AP refused to adopt the president's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The judge stated that while the White House isn't obligated to grant the AP permanent access, it can't exclude journalists based on their viewpoints. The ruling comes after the AP sued to regain access, arguing the ban was a form of retaliation and viewpoint discrimination, thus undermining press freedom and the public's right to factual reporting.</p>

            <p>Following the controversial seizure and euthanization of a pet squirrel named P'Nut by New York state environmental officers, Republican lawmakers are pushing for 'Peanut's Law.' The proposed legislation would mandate a 72-hour waiting period before the Department of Environmental Conservation can euthanize a seized animal, allowing owners time for a hearing. P'Nut, an internet-famous squirrel with a large social media following, was taken from his owners after an anonymous complaint and subsequently killed, sparking public outrage and calls for greater protection for domesticated animals. This bill aims to provide due process and prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in funding for Cornell University and $790 million for Northwestern University, citing concerns about the protection of Jewish students on campus following pro-Palestinian protests. These funding pauses, primarily affecting grants and contracts, follow warning letters sent to 60 universities regarding potential enforcement actions. The administration alleges that the universities have failed to adequately address antisemitism on their campuses, while critics argue that the crackdown infringes on free speech and academic freedom. Several other universities are facing similar investigations, leading to billions in frozen federal funding.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is accelerating the construction of the California-Mexico border wall by waiving environmental regulations near Jacumba Hot Springs. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited an 'acute and immediate need' to prevent unlawful entries, bypassing laws that require environmental impact assessments. Critics argue that these waivers will harm border communities and ecosystems, while the administration emphasizes the need to secure the southern border amid fluctuating migrant arrivals. This move follows previous instances of waiving environmental laws for border wall construction and comes as the Senate considers allocating billions more for the project.</p>

            <p>The acting commissioner of the IRS is resigning due to a disagreement over the Treasury Department's decision to share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The IRS disclosed its agreement with DHS, allowing ICE to cross-verify the names and addresses of immigrants with their tax records. Treasury argues the agreement will help secure U.S. borders, while advocates say it violates privacy laws. Tax law experts warn that IRS officials risk breaking the law by sharing the data.</p>

            <p>Nearly three years after its launch, the 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline faces challenges due to understaffing and underfunding, threatening its mission to provide critical mental health support. While calls have increased significantly, access to care after the initial calls has not kept pace. Experts are advocating for more awareness and funding to enhance the effectiveness of 988. Potential federal cuts to public health services could further exacerbate the situation, leading to more hospitalizations and deaths.</p>

Alabama's CHOOSE Act, will provide eligible families with as much as $7,000 in state money through education savings accounts for private school tuition or costs at a participating school. Families submitted 22,167 applications for a total of 36,873 students. The substantial number of applications raises the possibility that the state will exhaust the available $100 million in funding for the first year of the program.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants alleged to be members of a Venezuelan gang under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court clarified that those subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. The decision split the court 5-4, with liberal justices dissenting. The ruling comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary. The Supreme Court said detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.</p>

            <p>President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang membership has sparked legal challenges. The law, enacted during a potential war with France, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of enemy nations during war or invasion. Trump declared the Tren de Aragua gang a threat to the US, justifying the use of the act. The Supreme Court has ruled that individuals subject to the act are entitled to judicial review. The act has been invoked three times in US history, including during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced significant losses. The sell-off follows anxieties about the economic impact of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. While stocks rebounded earlier in the day due to hopes of tariff reductions, the White House's confirmation of the levies triggered a renewed wave of selling. Investors are concerned about the potential for higher inflation and stalled economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The resolution is crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts. Despite the president's endorsement, some House Republicans are hesitant, citing concerns about the level of spending cuts. The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold. The resolution doesn't address disagreements over spending cuts, pushing a confrontation further down the road.</p>

            <p>A public feud has erupted between Trump advisors Peter Navarro and Elon Musk, with Navarro claiming Tesla is merely assembling cars from foreign parts and Musk retorting that Tesla has the most American-made cars. Factually, Musk is correct, as Tesla is significantly more vertically integrated than most automakers, building its own batteries and even an in-house lithium refinery. Data shows that a high percentage of Tesla's Model 3 parts are sourced from the U.S. or Canada. Despite tariffs on car parts, Tesla is expected to be less impacted than its rivals due to its localized production.</p>
