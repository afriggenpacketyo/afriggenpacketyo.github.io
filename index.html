          <p>Florence Welch, the singer from Florence and the Machine, revealed that she had life-saving emergency surgery in August 2023 after experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. Welch was unknowingly suffering from serious internal bleeding while performing on stage at a festival. She was diagnosed with a ruptured fallopian tube after suffering a miscarriage, requiring immediate surgery to remove the affected organ. Welch had previously cancelled concerts citing reasons she wasn't ready to discuss, and she is now preparing to release a new album in October, titled 'Everybody Scream'.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Discusses Potential Shift in US-China Relations Under Trump</h2>

          <p>An opinion article discusses the potential end of ideology in US-China relations under President Trump, suggesting a "reverse convergence" where the US may adopt similar approaches to political legitimacy and war as China. The author argues that this shift is not about the US losing soft power, but rather about a change in how the US approaches international relations. The piece challenges the long-held Western belief in convergence theory, which posits that societies become more alike as they industrialize, and highlights the complexities of social change and power dynamics between nations.</p>

          <p>The UK, Germany, and France have called on Iran to avoid escalating tensions and to pursue negotiations after UN sanctions were reinstated due to concerns over Iran's nuclear program. The three countries said they had "no choice" but to bring back the measures against Tehran as a last resort. Iran has recalled its ambassadors to Britain, France, and Germany for consultations. Talks between the countries and Iran on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly failed to produce a deal delaying the sanctions.</p>

Nine varieties of rice, including risotto, basmati, and sushi rice, are being tested in mini paddy fields. The project could help the UK tackle climate change by flooding peat soils, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and is of interest to the government.</p>

The sanctions, which freeze Iranian assets and halt arms deals, come after last-minute diplomacy failed.

The country maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity, raising concerns about potential weaponization.

          <p>President Trump's recent statements and actions, including his claim of finding an answer to autism and his remarks at Charlie Kirk's memorial, suggest a disregard for conventional political norms. His attacks on Europe's immigration policies and his reaction to the indictment of James Comey further illustrate his unfiltered approach. Trump's actions are framed as challenging conventions and demonstrate a belief that he is above the normal consequences of politics, law, or diplomacy. This has caused concern and speculation about what he is capable of.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy expresses concerns about the increasing partisanship and lack of respectful discourse in America today. In his new book, Kennedy discusses his role as a "swing justice" on the court and his views on key issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. He notes that the court has become more conservative over time and reflects on his relationships with other justices, including Antonin Scalia. Kennedy emphasizes the importance of liberty being understood over time and not solely based on originalist interpretations of the Constitution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, examining various forms of collagen intake and expert opinions. While some studies suggest oral collagen may have an impact, consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth remains skeptical about its ability to target the skin effectively. The article discusses marine, bovine, and vegan collagen, with marine collagen being recommended for its type 1 content. Professor Faisal Ali emphasizes that using sunblock, maintaining a healthy diet, and quitting smoking have a far greater impact on skin health than collagen supplements.</p>
