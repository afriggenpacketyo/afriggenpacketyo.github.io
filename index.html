          <p>Following the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crash shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, investigators are combing through the wreckage to determine the cause of the disaster. The crash resulted in the deaths of at least 241 people on board and several individuals on the ground. Authorities are relying on DNA testing to identify the charred remains of the passengers, and they are searching for the black boxes to gain further insights into the incident. Initial reports suggest investigators are examining the possibility of a loss or reduction in engine thrust as a contributing factor, while the lone survivor reported hearing a strange noise followed by a sudden descent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily fixing rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months. This decision comes as the US dollar index has fallen to a three-year low due to expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Concerns over US tariff policies and debt sustainability have also contributed to the dollar's weakness, lending relative strength to the yuan. While a recent agreement "in principle" between China and the US signaled a potential trade truce, some analysts remain cautious. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists argue that the recent decline in "white collar" jobs is primarily due to structural issues within the economy, rather than artificial intelligence replacing human workers. While professional and business services have experienced a slowdown in hiring, industries like health care and construction are seeing job growth. Experts emphasize that AI technology is still in its early stages and cannot yet execute key skills without human intervention. Despite the current limited impact, economists acknowledge that AI could transform jobs in the future, noting the rise in consulting roles focused on implementing generative AI.</p>

          <p>Despite rising tensions and Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe that Tehran is unlikely to retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait would disrupt global oil flows, but experts argue it would be counterproductive for Iran, potentially triggering further retaliation and alienating its largest oil customer, China. The Strait of Hormuz, partly controlled by Oman, is wide enough that Iran cannot close it entirely, and any attempt to do so would be a "last resort" contingent on a direct military engagement with the US.</p>

          <p>George Monbiot discusses David Attenborough's new film, "Ocean," which bluntly reveals the plunder of our seas, primarily caused by the fishing industry. He welcomes the government's announcement of a ban on trawling and scallop dredging in half of England's Marine Protected Areas but argues that this should be the bare minimum. He suggests that the default position should be protection, allowing only limited fishing activities in specific areas managed by local communities. Monbiot emphasizes that fish are wildlife, not merely "seafood," and calls for an end to government subsidies for the destructive fishing industry.</p>

          <p>A document from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) supporting Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to change U.S. policy on COVID vaccines is being criticized for citing unpublished or disputed studies and mischaracterizing others. Health experts have labeled the document "willful medical disinformation" regarding the safety of COVID vaccines for children and pregnant women. The HHS document cites outdated research and omits studies that demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines, particularly for pregnant women. Experts argue that Congress relies on health agencies for accurate guidance and may be misled by the document's inaccuracies.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has dismissed all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine advisory panel (ACIP) and appointed new members, some of whom have publicly criticized government policies on COVID-19 and mRNA vaccines. The ACIP plays a crucial role in determining vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage, making its decisions impactful for all Americans. Immunization specialists express concern that the new committee may be skeptical of vaccines and could downgrade the importance of certain shots, potentially limiting access for families.

While India has substantial REE reserves, it lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the US, and Japan. (not investment advice)</p>
