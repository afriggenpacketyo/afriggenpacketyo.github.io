          <p>Justin Baldoni's legal team claims Blake Lively threatened Taylor Swift to garner public support during her legal battle against Baldoni, a claim Lively's lawyer vehemently denies as baseless. Baldoni's team believes subpoenaing Swift is necessary, alleging Lively asked Swift to delete text messages and demanded a supportive statement, intimating the release of personal text messages if Swift refused. Swift's spokesperson denies any significant involvement in the film besides licensing her song. The legal conflict between Lively and Baldoni, stemming from their film 'It Ends With Us,' involves accusations of sexual harassment and defamation, with a trial scheduled for March 2026.</p>

          <p>Residents in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, claim a jet fuel leak from a Sunoco Pipeline went undetected for months, poisoning their drinking water. Kristine Wojnovich noticed an oily taste and smell in her water in 2023, but Sunoco initially found nothing. After 16 months and a state investigation, a leak was discovered, impacting at least 38 wells. Wojnovich found 15 gallons of jet fuel atop her well and is now suing Sunoco, which has installed water filtration systems and is cleaning up the neighborhood. According to federal data, Sunoco spilled more fuel than any other pipeline company in the US in 2024.</p>

          <p>President Trump's acceptance of a luxury plane from Qatar has united critics and supporters alike in opposition. While Democrats predictably slammed the move, some of Trump's staunchest allies have also voiced serious reservations, describing it as a "bribe" or an example of high-level corruption. Critics point to Qatar's alleged funding of terrorist groups and question the motives behind the gift. Despite White House assurances of transparency and compliance with all applicable laws, many commentators believe the deal comes with unspoken strings attached, with some suggesting it could influence Trump's decisions in the future.</p>

The meeting marks a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Syria, despite al-Sharaa's extremist past.

          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, the history of the Great Wall Film Company is being recognized as one of the first Chinese American film studios in the country. Frustrations with "one-dimensional," "demeaning" characters led Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do to found and finance the company in 1921. The streets of the city can look almost unrecognizable more than 100 years later, but researchers say I.S. 281 Joseph B. Cavallaro along Cropsey Avenue in Gravesend now stands on the site of the former studio.</p>

This allows them to speak their truth and share their stories and have their voices heard, not just by us here in the city of Minneapolis, but to have people nationally be able to hear their stories and have people in future generations, two, three generations down the road that can hear those stories as well.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars. The brothers were convicted of the 1989 killings of their parents, claiming they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The resentencing decision has significant implications for the families involved, the community, and the principles of justice, according to Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman.

          <p>A luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing the tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch along with six others, was knocked over by "extreme wind" and could not recover, according to an interim report into the disaster. The UK's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said winds of over 80mph "violently" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds. Investigators say the yacht was knocked to a 90-degree angle within 15 seconds, causing people, furniture and loose items to fall across the deck. The MAIB is investigating the incident as the Bayesian was registered in the UK.</p>

          <p>A mosquito-borne disease, the Usutu virus, has spread across much of southern England, raising fears for the blackbird population. Scientists are monitoring its spread amid warnings that mosquitoes and the diseases they carry may expand their range under climate change. The virus has been linked to declines in some blackbird populations, with a 40% decrease observed in Greater London since 2020. Scientists are calling for volunteers to count blackbirds in their gardens to gather more data on the comings and goings of the birds.</p>

          <p>Republican state lawmakers in Missouri approved a new referendum that would seek the repeal of an abortion-rights amendment approved by voters last year. The newly proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner, if Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election before then. The new measure would seek to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of sexual assault or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>

Cyber experts said the response from Co-op was sensible, with Co-op seeming to have opted for self-imposed immediate-term disruption as a means of avoiding criminal-imposed, longer-term disruption.</p>
