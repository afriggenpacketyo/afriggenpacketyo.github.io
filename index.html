          <p>Japanese boxing sensation Naoya Inoue has arrived in Los Angeles, expressing his determination to continue his knockout streak in his upcoming super bantamweight title defense against Ramon Cardenas in Las Vegas on May 4. Inoue, nicknamed "Monster," acknowledged Cardenas as a well-rounded boxer, expressing his desire to excite fans with a dynamic performance reminiscent of heavyweight boxers. This fight marks Inoue's fourth appearance in the United States, and he aims to box as usual, motivated by the Las Vegas setting, which he hopes will provide a more relaxed experience compared to his previous pandemic-impacted trips. This is not about hoping for a decision, but rather a dynamic performance that matches those from heavyweight boxers.</p>

          <p>British fintech firm Revolut has reported its first $1 billion annual profit, accompanied by a 72% revenue increase, marking a significant milestone as it prepares to launch its U.K. bank later this year. The company's net profit for 2024 reached £1.1 billion ($1.5 billion), driven by substantial growth in its wealth unit and subscriptions, with the CFO stating that the company's aim is to formally launch its U.K. bank later this year. Obtaining a U.K. banking license allows Revolut to accept deposits protected by government guarantees, potentially attracting more customers and enabling the launch of new lending products like credit cards and personal loans. Revolut views its transition to a U.K. bank as crucial for its global expansion and eventual IPO.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has finalized rules requiring social media platforms and websites to protect children from harmful online content, with potential fines for non-compliance. Sites hosting pornography or content promoting self-harm must implement robust age checks and adjust algorithms to filter out harmful content from children's feeds. Platforms must also establish streamlined reporting systems and designate a person accountable for children's safety, with annual risk management reviews by senior management. While some critics argue the restrictions don't go far enough, Ofcom asserts these measures are a game-changer, legally obligating companies to prioritize the safety of under-18 users.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on a bribery charge, adding to the list of ex-leaders facing criminal trials in South Korea. The charge is related to the employment of his former son-in-law at a now-defunct budget airline, where he allegedly received undue salary and allowances. Prosecutors consider these payments a bribe from the airline's owner for the benefit of Moon's family, even though the son-in-law was not qualified for the position. This indictment follows a pattern of South Korean leaders facing scrutiny after leaving office.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has refuted claims of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, stating that reports of progress lack factual basis. The ministry's spokesperson emphasized that if the U.S. genuinely seeks to resolve trade issues, it should eliminate all unilateral tariffs on Chinese goods and engage in equal dialogue. This denial contrasts with recent statements from U.S. officials suggesting potential reconsideration of tariffs and the possibility of future discussions, amid ongoing trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Starting April 2026, Japan will enforce a revised road traffic law, imposing fines on cyclists aged 16 and older for minor traffic violations like using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights. This initiative aims to reduce accidents involving cyclists, particularly following a rise in bicycle usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fines will range from 3,000 to 12,000 yen depending on the offense, and the revised law also mandates cyclists to keep to the left side of the road, while vehicles must pass cyclists at a safe speed. This measure complements existing penalties for cycling under the influence of alcohol or using a mobile phone dangerously.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the luxury goods group owning Gucci, experienced a significant drop after reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales, signaling ongoing challenges for the luxury sector. Gucci sales, which constitute a substantial portion of Kering's revenue, declined sharply, reflecting the brand's struggle to regain favor with consumers amid a broader downturn in the luxury market. The company's overall weakness was driven by sales declines in Asia, North America, and Europe, prompting Kering's CEO to acknowledge a difficult start to the year and highlight macroeconomic headwinds. The appointment of a new artistic director for Gucci has also stirred investor concern.</p>

The upcoming meeting is part of ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, with speculation that Bessent would raise exchange rates, given Trump's accusations of Japan devaluing its currency.

          <p>SK Hynix, a key Nvidia supplier, exceeded quarterly revenue and operating profit estimates due to strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose 42% year-on-year, while operating profit surged 158%, driven by the impact of AI on the memory market. However, the company cautioned that macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policy, create demand volatility impacting the second half of the year. Despite these concerns, SK Hynix anticipates limited tariff impact on its AI server demand, with consumer electronics demand expected to benefit from new AI functionalities.</p>

          <p>China is attempting to reshape the global scientific publishing landscape by showcasing its growing scientific soft power through recent changes to its journal ranking system. The National Science Library under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) released an updated Journal Ranking Table, sorting around 22,000 journals into tiers based on self-defined evaluation criteria. This ranking is now a critical component of China’s research evaluation system, with many universities and research institutions using it to assess researcher output. The latest publication was noteworthy, particularly after some established international top-tier journals were downgraded to the second tier.</p>

Lucy, 32, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 12 weeks pregnant, and at 20 weeks, a team of 15 doctors performed a five-hour operation to remove the cancerous cells on both ovaries behind the womb. The procedure, with risks to both mother and child, has only been carried out a handful of times across the world. Her son was then returned to Lucy and was "born again" at the end of January weighing 6lb 5oz.</p>

An email, seen by BBC London, has been sent to vehicle owners by the management company for Rathbone Square, CBRE.

Purchasing managers’ indices and retail sales data are also being closely watched for early signs of economic contraction.
