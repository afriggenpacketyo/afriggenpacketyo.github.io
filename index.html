          <p>President Trump's executive order threatens to dismantle the Department of Education, jeopardizing the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.  While Congress alone can eliminate the department, the administration's actions could severely limit its resources and create significant uncertainty for borrowers. Experts warn of potential chaos and disruptions to the loan system.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Holds Interest Rates Amidst Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-20 12:24:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England maintained UK interest rates at 4.5%, citing intensified economic and global trade uncertainty.  While a gradual decline in rates is anticipated, the current inflation rate remains above the Bank's target. This decision will have limited immediate impact on many homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages, but those with variable rates will feel the effects.</p>
