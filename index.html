          <p>Authorities have identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing. The FBI believes Bartkus, who is thought to be dead, had nihilistic views and intentionally targeted the clinic, possibly attempting to livestream the event. The bombing, described as an act of terrorism, resulted in significant damage and several injuries, though thankfully all embryos at the facility were saved. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities searching Bartkus's home and examining his writings to determine his motives and any potential accomplices.</p>

          <p>A three-day strike by NJ Transit engineers has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative deal. Train service is set to resume on Tuesday, following inspections of the train cars and tracks. The strike, which halted train service across New Jersey, impacted over 100,000 daily riders. Governor Phil Murphy described the deal as fair and fiscally responsible, involving concessions related to work rules that will offset the cost of wage increases. The last NJ Transit strike occurred in 1983, highlighting the significance of this recent labor action.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist believes that the Chinese yuan has the potential to challenge the U.S. dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. While the yuan is already used in cross-border purchase settlements, China needs to deepen its financial markets to attract more foreign investment in yuan-denominated assets. The economist cited China's existing "connect" schemes with Hong Kong as a potential model for increasing foreign access to mainland Chinese bonds and stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal agents are actively combating child exploitation, particularly sextortion, but face challenges due to public reluctance to discuss the issue. Despite a surge in child sex exploitation cases, silence and a lack of news coverage hinder efforts to warn families and catch criminals. The Justice Department has launched "Operation Restore Justice" to track down offenders and raise awareness. Child safety experts emphasize the importance of open communication and removing the stigma surrounding conversations about child abuse.</p>

The attack, which involved an estimated 273 drones, resulted in casualties and injuries.

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, has defeated George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump, in the Romanian presidential election. With more than 98 percent of ballots counted, preliminary official results gave 54 percent of the vote in the presidential runoff to Mr. Dan, 55, the mayor of Romania’s capital, Bucharest. The election was tense due to Russia's meddling. It is likely that his victory will calm fears in Europe’s political mainstream that Romania, which borders Ukraine and plays a vital role in defending NATO’s eastern flank against Russia, might join Hungary and Slovakia in opposing help for Ukraine and in cozying up to Moscow.</p>
