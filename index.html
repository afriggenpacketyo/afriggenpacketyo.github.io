        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the ice cream company, expressing profound disappointment over what he views as the erosion of its social mission independence under Unilever's ownership. Greenfield stated that Unilever had initially pledged to maintain the brand's commitment to peace, justice, and human rights, actively speaking out on real-world events. However, he now believes that foundational independence, which was a core condition of their sale to Unilever, is no longer upheld. Co-founder Ben Cohen echoed this sentiment, asserting that their legacy should remain true to their values rather than being silenced by corporate interests. This article underscores the ongoing challenges activist brands face within larger corporate structures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the UK aims to significantly deepen trade and business ties, with major investments from US tech giants like Nvidia, OpenAI, and Blackstone already announced for UK data centers and AI infrastructure. This diplomatic event is seen as a critical confidence boost for the British government, currently navigating domestic political challenges and a sluggish economy. The UK is particularly keen to finalize its "economic prosperity deal" with the US and push for the elimination of steel and aluminum tariffs, although progress on the latter remains uncertain. The article underscores the strategic importance of this engagement for both nations, despite the inherent unpredictability of the US President's public statements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading activity on Wednesday as investors keenly awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, where an interest rate cut is widely anticipated. Japan's Nikkei 225 remained largely flat, while its exports saw a smaller-than-expected contraction in August. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged, partly due to Baidu's strong performance following a bond offering and AI collaboration agreement. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, however, plunged, reflecting broader concerns about global demand. This article highlights the varied economic signals across the region amid global monetary policy expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Japan's August Exports Decline Less Than Forecast, Driven by Rebounding Asian Shipments</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller contraction than anticipated in August, marking a fourth consecutive month of negative growth but showing resilience due to a rebound in shipments to Asia. Government data revealed a 0.1% year-on-year fall, better than the 1.9% expected by economists, though exports to the U.S. continued a steeper decline. This positive development in Asian trade partially offset broader negative trends influenced by U.S. tariffs and earlier export front-loading. The article notes the data precedes the Bank of Japan's rate decision, with economists expecting rates to remain steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK aims to achieve more than just business deals from President Trump's second state visit, focusing on refining the existing trade agreement and securing a much-needed confidence boost for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Key objectives include pushing for the elimination of remaining steel and aluminum tariffs, which currently stand at 25%, to support the precarious British steel industry. Domestically, Starmer hopes the visit will help shift the narrative away from recent political scandals, such as the resignation of his deputy and the sacking of the US Ambassador, by projecting unity and global influence. This article highlights the multi-faceted diplomatic and political aspirations tied to the high-profile visit.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani was removed from the game after five no-hit innings and just 68 pitches, a decision made by manager Dave Roberts due to Ohtani's recovery from Tommy John surgery and a pre-determined pitch limit. Despite Ohtani's dominance, the Dodgers' bullpen subsequently collapsed, surrendering six runs in the sixth inning and ultimately losing 9-6 to the Philadelphia Phillies. Ohtani contributed offensively with his 50th home run of the season, but the relief corps' continued struggles overshadowed his impressive pitching performance.

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested five individuals, dismantling a sophisticated bicoastal drug trafficking operation accused of flying 22 tons of cocaine and millions in cash between Los Angeles and New York City. The alleged ringleaders, David “Gotti” Rodriguez and Raymond “White Boy” O’Connell, used a downtown LA jewelry store as a front, employing luxury freight companies to ship concealed drug parcels. In total, approximately $315 million worth of cocaine was transported, with proceeds laundered back to the West Coast.
