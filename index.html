          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 mark, reaching its highest level since March, as investors seek refuge from stock market volatility and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's price has increased by over 3% to $90,282.00, marking a two-day gain of over 7%. This surge coincides with a sell-off in U.S. equities and escalating tensions between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Bitcoin's resilience is attributed to its decoupling from risk assets and strong support from long-term holders, despite light trading volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has sparked concerns about his potential attempts to influence monetary policy. Economists suggest that even firing Powell might not be enough to achieve Trump's desired rate cuts.

The Supreme Court is set to hear an appeal about Trump's firing of board members at other federal organizations, which could shed light on what's next for the Fed.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its global growth forecast, predicting that the U.S. economy will be disproportionately affected by President Trump's tariffs.
