            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, China's National Film Administration announced it will reduce the number of American films allowed to be shown in China. This decision comes after President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures from China. Chinese officials stated that the U.S.'s tariff policies would negatively impact the domestic audience's favorability towards American films. China, a crucial market for Hollywood, will follow market rules and respect audience choice while moderately reducing American film imports, signaling a shift in the landscape of international film distribution.</p>

            <p>Inflation eased in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, but economists warn that tariffs could reverse this trend in the coming months.

Economists express concern over rising grocery prices and the potential inflationary impact of the Trump administration's tariff policy. Tariffs, a tax paid by U.S. importers, are expected to increase costs for businesses and consumers, potentially pushing the U.S. inflation rate to around 4% by the end of 2025.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent climbdown on tariffs has revealed chaos at the core of his presidency, even as it fails to fully alleviate the policy's most painful effects. The initial tariff announcement triggered global market crashes and recession warnings, followed by a sudden reversal that placated Wall Street but left Americans facing higher consumer prices. Despite attempts to portray the shift as strategic, Trump's own explanation highlighted a loss of nerve in response to market pressure. The episode raises questions about the credibility of Trump's economic policy and the courage of Republicans to challenge his decisions.</p>

            <p>Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands stated that President Trump's immigration policies are negatively affecting beer sales, alongside the impact of tariffs. Hispanic consumers, who account for roughly half of Constellation's beer sales, are reducing spending due to concerns about immigration issues and job losses. This pullback in spending affects social gatherings, where beer consumption is common. The company also gave a weaker-than-expected outlook for its fiscal year 2026, reflecting the combined effects of tariffs and immigration policies.</p>

The pause provides some relief to nations heavily reliant on exports to the US, but many countries will still face higher levies than before. Despite the pause, economists warn that US trade policy has shifted significantly, potentially harming the global economy.
