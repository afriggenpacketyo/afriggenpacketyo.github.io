          <p>Following a closed-door meeting at the NATO Summit in The Hague, President Trump indicated a willingness to provide Ukraine with additional aid, including Patriot air-defense missiles. Trump noted Ukraine's desire for these missiles and mentioned their effectiveness, particularly referencing their use in Israel. Zelenskyy affirmed Ukraine's readiness to purchase more U.S. weapons and expressed interest in joint drone production, with Trump praising Zelenskyy's bravery and urging Putin to end the conflict. The meeting marked a shift in Trump's tone towards Zelenskyy, expressing compassion for the situation in Ukraine. Optimism for a resolution remains uncertain amid ongoing tensions. </p>

          <p>Arsenal has reportedly reached an agreement with Brentford to acquire midfielder Christian Norgaard for an initial fee of ¬£10 million, potentially rising to ¬£15 million with add-ons. This move coincides with uncertainty surrounding Thomas Partey's contract situation at Arsenal, as his current deal is set to expire soon. While Sevilla's Lucien Agoume was also considered, manager Mikel Arteta prioritized Norgaard due to his Premier League experience and readiness. The Danish international is expected to undergo a medical before finalizing the transfer to Arsenal, bolstering their midfield options for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of US lawmakers has introduced a bill in Congress to prohibit federal agencies from using artificial intelligence technologies developed in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The proposed legislation, titled the ‚ÄúNo Adversarial AI Act,‚Äù aims to address concerns that AI controlled by foreign adversaries poses a direct threat to national security, data, and government operations. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi emphasized the need to safeguard US interests against potential risks associated with foreign-controlled AI, highlighting the ongoing tech rivalry between the US and China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is proposing a rule to relax capital requirements for large Wall Street banks, sparking dissent among officials who fear it could weaken critical safeguards. The proposed measure, known as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, aims to adjust the quantity and quality of capital banks must maintain. While supporters like Fed Chair Jerome Powell argue it's prudent to reconsider the original approach due to the increase in safe assets on bank balance sheets, others like Governor Michael Barr worry it will incentivize capital distribution to shareholders rather than Treasury market intermediation. The rule would lower capital requirements, aligning with Basel standards, but faces opposition due to concerns about financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eurostar services are returning to normal after facing major disruptions caused by two separate fatalities on the LGV Nord line and subsequent cable theft. The cable theft near Lille, involving approximately 600 meters of copper cables, forced trains to be rerouted, resulting in extended journey times and cancellations. Eurostar urged passengers to postpone their journeys, offering free changes or full refunds to those affected. Technicians worked to repair the railway cables, and one track was reopened to allow some trains to run in both directions while full repairs were underway. Delays are still expected, and passengers are advised to check for updates.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are encountering challenges in passing President Trump's domestic agenda bill by the July 4th deadline due to disagreements within the party. A major sticking point is funding for rural hospitals, with senators debating the impact of proposed Medicaid tax cuts. Senate leaders are also awaiting the Senate parliamentarian's review to ensure the bill's tax provisions comply with Senate rules. Concerns over Medicaid cuts, energy tax credits, and state and local tax breaks are causing divisions among Republicans, potentially undermining Senate Majority Leader John Thune's goal of passing the bill swiftly. Negotiations are ongoing to address these concerns and garner sufficient support for the legislation.</p>

          <p>Following the US and Israel's military actions against Iran's nuclear program, experts have provided mixed assessments of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Iran policy. While some experts believe the IAEA's monitoring and warnings have been insufficient to deter Iran's nuclear ambitions, others acknowledge the agency's limitations and its role in gathering intelligence. Critics argue that the IAEA lacks enforcement capabilities and that the international community bears responsibility for Iran's non-compliance. Despite the US and Israel's use of force, the IAEA continues to urge diplomacy and warns against escalating violence. The effectiveness of the IAEA's approach remains a subject of debate.</p>

Speculation about BP as an acquisition target has persisted due to its underperformance compared to rivals and strategic shifts in its approach to renewable energy investments.

          <p>President Trump doubled down on his assertion that U.S. bomb strikes completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, despite an initial intelligence report suggesting otherwise. He claimed the Iranian nuclear site at Fordo was "obliterated," while the preliminary assessment found that the airstrikes likely set Iran's nuclear program back by a few months, not years. Trump acknowledged the Defense Intelligence Agency's report but suggested the data was insufficient, stating that the assessment said the damage from the U.S. attacks "may be very severe." The reporting undermines claims from Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the strikes had totally "obliterated" the country's nuclear program.</p>

A judge ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books for training its AI model was transformative and did not violate copyright law. However, the company still faces a trial in December regarding the downloading of millions of pirated books. Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees had expressed concerns about the legality of using pirate sites to access books.

As of late June, interest rates are similar, but potential Federal Reserve rate cuts could change this. Home equity loan rates are fixed, while HELOC rates are variable, so the timing of securing funding matters. Homeowners should weigh the lower initial home equity loan rate against the possibility of lower HELOC rates later this summer. Considering the home serves as collateral, homeowners may prefer the security of a fixed-rate home equity loan and consider refinancing if rates decline. (not investment advice)</p>
