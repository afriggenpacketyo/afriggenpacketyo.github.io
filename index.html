          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with Rwanda to establish an agreement for Kigali to accept deportees from the U.S., including Africans and other non-Rwandan nationals. The potential agreement involves financial compensation for Rwanda and other logistical details to be discussed soon. This initiative follows similar arrangements with countries like El Salvador, Mexico, and Panama to handle America's influx of migrants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised Trump's envoy to Africa, Massad Boulos, for his efforts in brokering peace and minerals deals in the region. The deportation talks coincide with U.S. efforts to mediate peace between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, approximately 10% of its Newark hub schedule, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and technology problems at the FAA. CEO Scott Kirby stated that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers "walked off the job" after technology failures. The airline is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the equipment outages caused by outdated technology and called for an "all-new air traffic control system." </p>

          <p>Saturday's British newspapers are dominated by two key stories: Reform UK's performance in local elections and a BBC interview with Prince Harry regarding his security in the UK. Publications such as The Daily Mail and The Times highlight the "Reform revolution" after Nigel Farage's party gained council seats and mayoralties. The Daily Telegraph features Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's reaction to the election results, while the Daily Express focuses on Prince Harry's "bombshell interview" and Princess Charlotte's birthday. The Financial Times stands apart by prioritizing the election results, describing Reform UK's victories as a "populist insurgency."</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina, triggering a brief tsunami warning. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for coastal areas, including the Strait of Magellan and Antarctic areas, but the warning was later withdrawn.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell determined that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments. The ruling is the first summary judgment in a series of cases brought by law firms penalized by the president for their associations with disfavored people and causes. Howell characterized the executive order as a deliberate attempt to harm Perkins Coie for its legal work and Mr. Trump's "grievances."</p>

          <p>The remains of two domestic cats discovered in a 500-year-old Spanish shipwreck in Florida's Pensacola Bay may represent the earliest evidence of cats in what is now the United States. The cats, an adult and a juvenile, were found in the wreckage of the Emanuel Point II, a Spanish conquistador ship that sank in 1559. Analysis suggests the adult cat primarily consumed fish and possibly domestic meat, rather than relying on rats for food. Cats were likely brought to the Americas by Europeans for pest control and were also considered lucky by sailors.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of a US man who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in Friede's blood that target neurotoxins, creating an antivenom cocktail that protected mice against fatal doses from 13 of 19 deadly snake species.</p>

The increase is attributed to the release of meme coins and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family. An Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions in World Liberty's stablecoin product, further boosting the family's financial position.

          <p>Authorities are conducting search and rescue operations for the body of an infant who was swept away after a family vehicle veered off a highway and into the Trinity River in Northern California. The accident occurred when a young couple from Shasta Lake lost control of their vehicle, sending it down an embankment and into the fast-moving river. The parents were trying to escape with their 9-month-old son when the current swept the child from the father's arms. The parents suffered minor to moderate injuries, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election with high costs of living and a shortage of housing as major issues. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party seeks a second term, while Peter Dutton's conservative opposition aims to oust the government. Annual inflation peaked at 7.8% after Labor was elected in 2022, and housing prices and rents have soared. Both parties have focused on changing demographics, with Millennials and Gen Zers outnumbering Baby Boomers for the first time. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange endorsed Albanese, praising his efforts to secure Assange's freedom.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is launching legal action against Ofsted, the UK's education inspection body, over proposed changes to school inspections. The union is seeking a judicial review of the new school report card system, which it argues is another "crude grading system" that will negatively impact school leaders. Ofsted maintains that supporting mental health is a key aspect of the proposals, but NAHT argues the changes will continue to harm the well-being of education staff. The decision follows calls to delay the new system after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has stopped shipping products directly from China to customers in the United States, transitioning to a local fulfillment model. This change follows the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole allowing low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices after the tariff changes, and some shoppers noticed the removal of many products shipped from China. The company says pricing for U.S. consumers will remain unchanged during the transition.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that establishing clear communication channels with agreed-upon negotiators is crucial for easing the US-China trade stand-off. One proposed approach involves appointing special envoys by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, but the US prefers direct negotiations between Trump and Xi. The lack of bilateral trust is fueled by disputes over China's role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from China and impacting trans-Pacific shipments and business plans.</p>

          <p>Research has revealed that a man who injected himself with snake venom for years has blood that could "revolutionize" snakebite treatment. Immunologist Jacob Glanville worked with Tim Friede, who had exposed himself to snake venom over 18 years, developing immunity to several neurotoxins. Scientists isolated antibodies from Friedeâ€™s blood that reacted with neurotoxins found within 19 snake species. The antivenom offered mice 100% protection against the venom for 13 species and partial protection (20% to 40%) for the remaining six. Experts say the human origin of the antibodies would likely mean fewer side effects than traditional antivenoms.</p>

While Trump suggests Americans will only have to make minor sacrifices, like buying fewer dolls, critics argue that tariffs will increase prices and negatively affect consumers. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's defense of onshoring manufacturing is also facing criticism for promoting jobs that lack the benefits of the past. Trump's promises to end inflation and cut taxes contrast with the reality of rising prices and tariffs, leading to declining approval ratings on the economy.</p>
