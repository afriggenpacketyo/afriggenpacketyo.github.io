          <h2>Shipping Organization Warns of Increased Threats Around Arabian Peninsula</h2>

          <p>Bimco, the largest global shipowners organization, warns of rising threats to commercial shipping around the Arabian Peninsula following recent events, including potential Iranian responses and Houthi actions. They anticipate that U.S. warships and ships affiliated with Israel or the U.S. are likely targets. Maersk has already temporarily suspended port calls to Haifa, Israel, while Hapag Lloyd maintains a high alert level crossing the Strait of Hormuz. The organization also cautioned about potential disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, which could lead to increased energy prices and shipping costs, as freight rates surge from Shanghai to Jebel Ali. The Strait of Hormuz handles less than 4% of global container trade but the ports of Jebel Ali and Khor Fakkan are critical intermediary points for global shipping networks in the region. The optimism score for this article is moderate given the potential economic and logistical disruptions. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated." Hegseth stated that the mission was a precise operation authorized by the president to neutralize threats to U.S. national interests and to defend troops and Israel. He emphasized that the operation was not aimed at regime change in Iran, echoing President Trump's remarks on the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The full extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities remains unclear, but the U.S. government is confident that they have made a significant blow to Iran's nuclear program. The assessment of the impact on Iran's nuclear capabilities is still ongoing.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, has warned of a "risk of escalation" in the Middle East and beyond. Starmer emphasized the need for de-escalation and a return to negotiations, stating that the UK government is doing everything possible to stabilize the situation and find a diplomatic solution. He confirmed that the UK was informed in advance of the U.S. action but had no direct involvement. The UK has been moving assets to the region to protect its interests and allies, and British military personnel are on high alert. The International Atomic Energy Agency has warned that Iran has amassed enough enriched uranium to potentially make nine nuclear bombs, which is a source of legitimate concern.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets largely ended higher despite the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that U.S. involvement would help resolve the conflict. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly down, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer. Analysts suggest that the Gulf states' calls for peaceful resolution and condemnation of Israeli aggression have shielded them from major market turmoil, and the market might be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat.

The heat wave is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend and arrive in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states early next week. Officials are urging people to stay indoors, use air conditioning, and avoid strenuous outdoor activities to prevent heat-related illnesses, emphasizing that extreme heat can be deadly. The forecast indicates that the Northeast faces a high risk of extreme heat through the middle of next week, with temperatures expected to reach into the 90s or even triple digits.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, intense discussions are underway within Iran's security and intelligence establishment regarding potential responses. Options range from immediate retaliation against U.S. interests to engaging in negotiations, which would involve ceasing all nuclear enrichment activities. Iran may consider retaliating against U.S. bases in the Middle East through its proxies in Iraq and Syria, or launching swarm attacks on U.S. Navy warships using drones and fast torpedo boats. Economic targets, such as disrupting the Strait of Hormuz, are also possibilities, but could antagonize Gulf Arab neighbors. The possibility of a cyberattack on U.S. networks is also under consideration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System has issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats at this time, the bulletin notes the potential for low-level cyberattacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. The bulletin also cautions that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to attack targets. U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020, and the likelihood of independent mobilization to violence could increase if Iranian leadership calls for retaliatory violence. Law enforcement in New York City has deployed additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites involved decoy bombers and "misdirection" to maintain secrecy, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine. Decoy B-2 stealth bombers flew towards Guam to divert attention, while the actual bombers deployed earlier and flew under the cover of darkness for 18 hours. The mission involved multiple in-flight refuelings and the dropping of 14 bunker buster bombs. A U.S. submarine also launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at key surface targets, with the element of surprise maintained throughout the mission. Iran did not deploy fighters or surface-to-air missiles, suggesting they were caught off guard.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has released details about "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The operation began with decoy B-2 stealth bombers flying west to the Pacific, while the main strike force of seven B-2 bombers flew eastward for 18 hours. A U.S. submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missiles to clear the way, and the B-2s dropped 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on Fordow and Natanz. The operation involved over 125 aircraft and marked the first operational use of the GBU 57 MOP weapon. The operation was deemed a success because Iranian fighters did not fly and Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not engage the strike package.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile barrage at Israel, wounding at least 21 people, after the U.S. joined Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, with searches underway for people trapped under rubble in Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that Iran launched about 30 missiles, and no alert sirens went off in Haifa despite a missile impact. Israel responded by striking dozens of missile and drone sites in Iran, eliminating Iranian Armed Forces soldiers loading missile launchers. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion," Iran has fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel, resulting in casualties on both sides. The strikes have caused serious damage to buildings, and a significant number of people have been killed in Iran.</p>

He accused the Trump administration of having "betrayed diplomacy" and stated that Iran "reserves all options to defend its security interests and people." Iran's ambassador to the UN requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to address the attacks, while the IAEA reported that Iranian nuclear officials said there had been no spike in off-site radiation levels.

          <p>The decision by President Trump to bomb nuclear sites in Iran without a congressional vote has sparked debate about the constitutional authority to wage war. Critics argue that the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, and that bypassing Congress weakens American democracy. The author contends that a congressional vote would educate lawmakers and the public, allow citizens to lobby their representatives, and hold members of Congress accountable for their choices. Unilateral actions by the president deprive Americans of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. The trend of denying the public democratic channels to oppose war is dangerous and could lead to radicalization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that certain phrases can trigger defiance in children. Traditional parenting phrases like "Because I said so" and threats can activate a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, using language that honors a child's autonomy while setting boundaries can foster cooperation. Examples of better phrases include explaining decisions, giving children agency over when they're ready to meet expectations, validating emotions, and inviting problem-solving instead of blame. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural by fostering respect, emotional safety, and involvement.</p>

          <p>Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, stated that it is too early to determine the full impact of the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear program. Himes described the strikes as a "massive gamble" by President Trump and expressed concern that they were undertaken without congressional approval. He cautioned against expecting a best-case scenario, citing the history of U.S. military involvements in the region. Himes emphasized that Congress holds the sole authority to declare war and expressed his unease with the lack of congressional involvement in the decision-making process.</p>

The band's improvisational attitude and Morrison's poetic lyrics set them apart. Their breakthrough came at the Whisky a Go Go, where their performances inspired a devoted following. Despite Morrison's struggles with substance abuse, The Doors achieved massive success with songs like "Light My Fire." The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book, "Night Divides the Day," and surviving members Densmore and Krieger continue to honor their legacy with performances.

          <p>Republicans in Florida are accused of racially gerrymandering two state senate districts to disenfranchise Black voters in the Tampa Bay area. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida argued that the redistricting process was unconstitutional and diluted Black voting power. The ACLU claims that the maps pack about half of the region's Black population into a single one of its five senate districts. A decision in favor of the plaintiffs would require a redrawing of Floridaâ€™s 16th and 18th senate districts. The case highlights concerns about racial gerrymandering and the manipulation of voting districts to undermine minority voting power.</p>

          <p>Despite facing challenges like tariffs, inflation, labor shortages, and higher financing costs, small business owners in the U.S. are maintaining a generally optimistic outlook. Recent surveys indicate that many small businesses have experienced growth and maintained or increased their workforce. However, optimism is tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth, and many have reported declines in financial health. While concerns about inflation have shifted to taxation, small businesses remain resilient and are not "jumping ship." The sentiment is stronger among younger business leaders, who are more likely to anticipate a positive economic impact.</p>

          <p>The shooting of an Indiana kidney doctor has raised concerns about a potential rise in vigilante violence. The prosecutor voiced concerns about a growing wave of disturbing vigilante violence that has no place in a civilized society. Tom Mueller, author of "How to Make a Killing: Blood, Death and Dollars in American Medicine," says the incident conjures many of the same complex swirl of emotions that Americans expressed after the UnitedHealthcare shooting. There is a visceral disgust for violence used to make a statement, he said. And there is long-running dismay about the shortcomings of America's health care system, which may be costing lives. That includes, he said, a rise of for-profit dialysis clinics and their impact on quality of care for those confronting end-stage kidney disease.</p>
