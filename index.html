          <p>The Japan Coast Guard reported that a Chinese research vessel was observed lowering a pipe-like object into the sea within Japan's exclusive economic zone near the Senkaku Islands. The coast guard radioed the vessel, urging it to cease its activities, suspecting unauthorized oceanographic research. This incident follows a similar occurrence in October 2023, where a Chinese vessel was detected conducting suspicious maneuvers in the same area. China's increasing military and maritime assertiveness in the East and South China Seas has led to repeated protests from Tokyo regarding intrusions into Japanese waters near the Senkakus. The Chinese vessel sailed to the Chinese side of the Japan-China median line after being approached.</p>

          <p>United CEO Scott Kirby addressed recent air traffic control radar outages at Newark International Airport, assuring the public that flying remains safe due to backup procedures and pilot training. Despite these safety measures, the outages have caused disruptions, including holding patterns and flight diversions. United has proactively reduced flights from its schedule in coordination with the FAA to mitigate potential customer impact. Kirby acknowledged a possible financial impact on United due to the schedule adjustments but emphasized that safety and customer service remain the top priorities. The CEO also expressed optimism about long-term improvements to the air traffic control system with bipartisan support and funding initiatives.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky responded cautiously to Russia's offer of direct talks, calling it a "positive sign" but insisting on an immediate cease-fire. This comes after European leaders set a deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions, with the U.S. potentially joining in imposing these sanctions. Russia's President Putin has proposed direct talks in Istanbul but rejected the cease-fire proposal unless Western governments cease supplying arms to Ukraine. Despite these diplomatic overtures, Russia resumed long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, launching 108 Iranian-designed Shahed drones, triggering air alarms in several cities.</p>

          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and the curator slated to be the first African woman to lead the Venice Biennale, has died in Basel, Switzerland, at the age of 57.

Kouoh was known for her work as the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, one of Africa’s largest contemporary art museums, where she built a global reputation as a champion for artists of color.

          <p>Democrats are preparing to select their next presidential nominee in 2028, and the party must first determine which state will lead the nominating calendar. In 2022, President Biden shifted South Carolina's primary ahead of Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, leading to a competition among these and other states for early-voting status. This decision is significant for the party as it grapples with its direction after losing the White House election to Republican Donald Trump. Early-state visits from potential 2028 candidates offer insights into their strategies and the segments of the Democratic base they aim to engage.</p>

          <p>The United States is reducing its efforts to promote democratic ideals abroad under President Trump, impacting programs that have historically been supported by both parties. The administration has diminished the Agency for Global Media, restructured the State Department to eliminate a global democracy office, and cut funding to the U.S. Agency for International Development. Experts warn that these actions will create a void in the promotion of freedom and representative government, potentially accelerating anti-democratic trends worldwide. Critics also point to the successful attempt to silence Voice of America through an executive order, effectively shutting it down.</p>

          <p>This article features the poem 'Infant Longing' by Li-Young Lee, exploring themes of love, loss, and the cyclical nature of the world. The poem reflects on the violence and innocence inherent in human existence, drawing on personal memories of the speaker's mother and the act of kissing as a means of both sealing and opening oneself to the world. It contemplates the difference between kisses that close and open the eyes, questioning who will alleviate suffering and revealing an infinite longing that transcends beginnings and ends.</p>

          <p>President Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, but without an immediate cease-fire, after European leaders issued an ultimatum for Russia to agree to a 30-day cease-fire. This move is viewed by some as an attempt to play for time and potentially split the Western coalition backing Ukraine. While Putin claims to want peace, it is only on Russia's terms, and the Kremlin seeks to maintain a good relationship with the Trump administration for potential sanctions relief and economic benefits. The offer of talks is being viewed with skepticism by Kyiv, given Putin's history of ordering the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The new rules will require care firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. This initiative is part of a series of changes to visa and recruitment laws aimed at cutting up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers coming to the UK over the next year.

In a society lacking structural support for families, these arrangements offer parents much-needed help with childcare, emotional support, and shared responsibilities. While such setups require coordination and can present challenges like differing parenting styles, many parents find the benefits of having friends nearby outweigh the difficulties.

          <p>An interview with a university researcher explores the phenomenon of doomsday prepping in America, revealing that nearly half of Americans engage in some form of preparedness for adverse events. The research traces the roots of prepping back to the American frontier spirit and self-sufficiency, highlighting the role of government inadequacy in disaster response as a motivator. The conversation touches on the conspicuous consumption of ultra-wealthy preppers, the rise of shelf-stable food markets, and the political question of individual versus collective action in the face of potential catastrophes. The researcher expresses concern over potential grid failure as a major worry.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with the Trump administration. This agreement would provide certainty to a £40 billion sector supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK. The deal also includes relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs potentially decreasing from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles annually and steel tariffs being eliminated. The aerospace and aviation industry has been lobbying the White House to retain a 45-year-old treaty that allowed aircraft and parts to be traded duty-free.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election features two candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, representing opposite sides of a political divide stemming from former President Yoon Suk Yeol’s martial law attempt. The election is viewed as a referendum on Mr. Yoon and his right-wing People Power Party. Mr. Lee, leading in pre-election surveys, aims to end the era of insurrection, while Mr. Kim warns of a left-wing behemoth if Mr. Lee wins.

          <p>Following US-mediated negotiations, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire over Kashmir, but experts warn that this will not easily lead to an enduring peace due to long-standing distrust. The US played a decisive role, leveraging IMF conditionalities and other factors to hasten the end of hostilities. Analysts from both countries believe that the ceasefire will hold in the short term due to international pressure and the recognition of the costs of escalation. Key issues such as terrorism and water security still pose long-term challenges to the relationship.</p>
