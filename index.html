          <p>A Texas nurse documented the evacuation of young girls from Camp Mystic, a summer camp devastated by catastrophic flash floods. A widely circulated video shows the campers singing worship songs on a bus as they are driven away from the destruction, an attempt to calm everyone down. The camp, located in Kerr County, suffered immense tragedy with at least 27 campers and counselors losing their lives in the disaster. The incident is part of a wider, deadly flooding event that has ravaged Central Texas, prompting a large-scale emergency response.</p>

          <p>A flash flood emergency was declared in New Mexico, where severe flooding led to multiple ongoing rescue missions, particularly in the Village of Ruidoso. A father and two children were reportedly washed away, and images showed homes being carried down the rapidly rising Rio Ruidoso, which swelled 15 feet in about an hour. The area's vulnerability to flooding is heightened by burn scars from wildfires last year, which have made the soil less stable. This event occurred as neighboring Texas was also grappling with its own catastrophic flooding disaster.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States pulls back from its traditional role in international development, exemplified by the restructuring of USAID, China is proactively filling the void. The author contends that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a central hub for providing global public goods, such as international mediation services. This shift is presented as a response to the 'America first' mentality, which is seen as neglecting soft power and creating an opportunity for China to increase its global influence.

          <p>The devastating human cost of the Central Texas floods is becoming clearer as victims are identified, many of whom were children attending Camp Mystic. The article shares personal tributes to some of those lost, including 8-year-old twin sisters Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence, a recent high school graduate working as a counselor, and the camp's director, Dick Eastland. Families and communities are grappling with what one relative described as 'unimaginable grief' in the wake of the unprecedented disaster.</p>

          <p>Grieving families are demanding answers following a massive explosion at a fireworks facility in Yolo County, California, that left seven people dead. The victims included two brothers, aged 18 and 22, who were working their first day at the temporary job. Authorities have provided little information about the cause of the blast or why the hazardous facility was operating in the area, leaving relatives to hold a vigil near the site as they wait for official identification of the remains.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind power capacity, installing as much in the first half of this year as it did in all of 2024, according to a new report. This surge is a key component of President Xi Jinping's strategy to develop the country's 'marine economy' and is driven by strong central government support. China is on pace to contribute more than half of the world's new offshore wind capacity in 2025, solidifying its role as a leader in the sector.</p>

          <p>A former senior judge in the UK, Sir Brian Leveson, has recommended a series of fundamental reforms to address a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 criminal cases. The proposals include using judge-only trials for offenses like fraud and bribery, and having less serious cases heard by a panel of a judge and two magistrates. While supporters believe this will speed up a broken system, some legal professionals argue that removing juries for certain trials undermines the essential right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

Survivors and campaigners note that victims often face career-ending blacklisting and public backlash, making it incredibly difficult for them to speak out against abuse and harassment.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the rush to assign blame for the deadly Texas floods is a distraction from the complex and converging factors that led to the tragedy. The author points to the region's natural vulnerability to flash floods, the inherent difficulty of precise forecasting, and a history of underinvestment in modern flood-warning systems. The article suggests that instead of political finger-pointing, the focus should be on understanding the systemic failures and developing robust solutions to prevent such a disaster from happening again.</p>

The trend is seen as a threat to the UK's financial services sector, which is a major contributor to the nation's tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

This massive carbon footprint is attributed to the significant increase in the number of matches and the heavy reliance on air travel between the widespread host cities.</p>
