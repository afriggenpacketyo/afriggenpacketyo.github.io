          <p>President Trump stated his desire for Iran to completely abandon its nuclear program, dismissing the notion of a simple ceasefire between Iran and Israel as insufficient. Speaking after cutting short his G7 summit attendance, Trump emphasized that he wants a "real end" to the nuclear issue. He predicted continued Israeli action against Iran and plans to monitor the situation from the White House Situation Room. Trump also addressed potential threats to U.S. interests, warning Iran against targeting U.S. troops and indicating the administration is working to assist Americans in leaving the region.</p>

The report emphasizes the importance of predictable policies, macroeconomic stimulus, and stable U.S.-China relations for sustained growth. China's private sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP and employment, experienced challenges during strict pandemic restrictions and regulatory crackdowns, but is now receiving renewed support from Beijing.</p>

Global oil demand is expected to peak at 105.6 million barrels per day by 2029, with production capacity rising to 114.7 million bpd by 2030.

          <p>An explosion at a fireworks factory in China's Hunan province has resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries, according to state-run National Radio. Rescue operations are complicated by the risk of additional explosions and the lack of a large water source nearby. China's Ministry of Emergency Management has dispatched a team to oversee the rescue efforts and investigate the cause of the explosion. Industrial accidents are a recurring issue in China due to lax safety standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome.
