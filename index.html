          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Sir Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy economics" regarding their welfare policies. Badenoch criticizes their consideration of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, arguing that taxpayers should not fund unlimited child support. She claims the Conservative party is the only one seriously examining the welfare state, while Starmer and Farage engage in a race to the bottom with unrealistic economic approaches. Badenoch believes Britain needs leaders who take economics seriously and do not treat it like entertainment.</p>

          <p>Nika Melia, a key figure in Georgia's largest opposition group, Coalition for Change, has been detained by police, accused of insulting law enforcement officers. This is the second such detention in recent days, following the pre-trial detention of another Coalition for Change leader, Zurab Japaridze. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of mimicking authoritarian tactics and steering the country towards Russia, away from its aspirations of joining the European Union. The government denies these allegations, but the detentions and the introduction of the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence have raised concerns about the state of democracy in Georgia.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Elon Musk's official role in the administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is ending, but hinted at ongoing collaboration. Musk's service concludes after the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. During his time at DOGE, the initiative reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though Democrats have criticized Musk's influence and potential conflicts of interest. Musk reassured Tesla shareholders that he would allocate more time to Tesla and SpaceX starting in June, now that his work at DOGE is complete.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure in the Trump administration as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has come to an end after a 129-day period marked by significant spending cuts and considerable controversy. DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various measures, including asset sales and workforce reductions, though the accuracy of these figures has been questioned. Musk's presence in the White House also raised ethical concerns due to potential conflicts of interest between his government role and his companies' business dealings with the US government. His work with DOGE also led to substantial cuts in international aid programs, reflecting an "America First" approach.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's order that found President Trump's global tariffs to be illegal, allowing the administration to continue collecting import taxes for now. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations. The White House maintains that the president must have the authority to conduct diplomatic and trade negotiations without judicial interference. While the case is litigated, the tariffs can be used, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk will hold a press conference in the Oval Office following Musk's departure from the administration. This announcement follows Musk's recent departure from his role in the administration. Meanwhile, President Trump's global tariff policy is facing challenges as a federal court ruled that he does not have the power to unilaterally impose some levies. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the ruling, arguing that it will cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario."</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the L.A.-raised documentarian and Oscar winner, has passed away at the age of 97. Ophuls, known for his unflinching examinations of World War II and its aftermath, directed the acclaimed film "The Sorrow and the Pity," which explored French collaboration with the Nazis. He also won an Academy Award for "Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," which detailed the crimes of the Gestapo chief in Lyon. Ophuls' work often challenged conventional narratives and confronted uncomfortable truths.</p>

          <p>Global investors are reassessing their US-heavy portfolios and considering undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China to "provide defence" amid geopolitical tensions. Despite aggressive tariffs towards Asia, particularly China, equities in the region have outperformed. Cambridge Associates notes that Chinese and Hong Kong stocks are attractive from a valuation perspective compared to US stocks. Institutional portfolios are starting to shift away from US markets, with Asia benefiting from relative value and policy support.</p>
