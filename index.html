          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the UK's Labour Party for a second time after she defended previous controversial remarks about racism. In a BBC interview, she reiterated her view that there is a difference between the racism experienced by Black people and the prejudice faced by Jewish people and Travellers. This action reignites internal party tensions over antisemitism and discipline under the leadership of Keir Starmer, who is seeking to maintain a firm stance on the issue.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, identifying it as a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. This decision follows a deadly attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists. India has praised the designation as a significant step in U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation, reflecting a strengthening of diplomatic ties between the two nations in addressing regional security threats.</p>

          <p>The German government under new Chancellor Friedrich Merz has resumed deportation flights to Afghanistan, sending back 81 Afghan men with criminal records. This action implements a key agreement from the governing coalition's platform to enforce a tougher migration policy. The move follows a pledge to increase the removal of rejected asylum-seekers and represents a significant policy shift since the Taliban's return to power, signaling a stricter approach to immigration and security.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. high-frequency trading firm Jane Street, accusing it of large-scale market manipulation involving the Nifty 50 index. The case brings into focus the fine line between legal arbitrage, which exploits existing price differences, and illegal manipulation, which involves creating artificial price movements. Experts cited in the article suggest the distinction hinges on intent and whether a firm actively distorts less liquid markets to profit in more liquid ones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Host Stephen Colbert has announced that CBS will be ending "The Late Show" in May 2026, clarifying that the entire show is being concluded, not just his tenure as host. While the network has stated the cancellation is a financial decision, the news has sparked widespread skepticism. The timing is notable, as it follows Colbert's public criticism of parent company Paramount Global for its $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>A key index measuring China's progress toward a market-based economy has declined, according to a report from a Beijing-based think tank. The overall marketisation score fell in 2023, with the most significant drop occurring in the sub-index for government-market relations, suggesting increased state intervention in the economy. In response to this trend, prominent Chinese economists are urging the government to implement further pro-market reforms to address systemic imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man faces a charge of hijacking constituting terrorism after he seized a small plane, causing a major security incident at Vancouver's airport. Authorities report the suspect, Shaheer Cassim, acted with an ideological motive related to climate change, with social media posts indicating he believed he was a "messenger" on a mission. The incident prompted the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble fighter jets before the plane was landed safely and the suspect was arrested.</p>

          <p>A man shares his personal story of a multi-year struggle to receive a diagnosis for Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a rare and often misdiagnosed form of skin cancer. His persistent symptoms were dismissed as a simple fungal infection for nearly two years until he insisted on a biopsy, which confirmed the cancer. His experience serves as a powerful testament to the importance of patient self-advocacy and highlights the systemic challenges in diagnosing and treating rare diseases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate moderated to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, primarily due to a slight easing in rice prices. However, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, keeping pressure on policymakers. Economists caution that risks remain, including persistent yen weakness and the potential impact of higher U.S. tariffs, which could complicate the country's economic outlook.

          <h2>Analysis Questions 'Financial' Motive Behind Stephen Colbert's Show Cancellation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:05:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Atlantic challenges the official explanation that "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" is being canceled for purely financial reasons. It argues the decision is part of a broader pattern of parent company Paramount capitulating to political pressure from President Donald Trump. The analysis points to the network's recent settlement of Trump's lawsuit and the departure of a top "60 Minutes" executive as evidence that ending the show of a vocal Trump critic is politically motivated, not financially necessary.</p>

          <p>On his prime-time show, Fox News host Jesse Watters acknowledged an error in a report that accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of lying about a phone call with President Trump. This on-air statement follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom against Watters and the network. While Watters apologized, he claimed his mistake stemmed from misinterpreting Newsom's social media post as "confusing," and the governor has indicated the lawsuit will continue.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has conceded that Europe was previously "free-riding" on U.S. defense spending, acknowledging past American accusations that allies were not contributing enough. Speaking to the BBC, Merz affirmed that Germany and its European partners now understand the need to do more for their own security, especially in light of the threat from Russia. This acknowledgment is backed by a significant increase in Germany's defense budget and efforts to strengthen security alliances with the UK and France.</p>

          <p>Cristosal, a leading human rights organization in El Salvador, has suspended its operations in the country, citing escalating threats and harassment from President Nayib Bukele's administration. The group, known for documenting abuses for 25 years, stated that the government's direct targeting of its members left them with a choice between "exile or prison." Cristosal's departure is part of a wider exodus of activists and journalists amid a government crackdown that critics say is eroding democratic freedoms.</p>
