          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering Harvey Willgoose, a fellow 15-year-old pupil, at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield. The stabbing, which occurred during a lunch break, followed a confrontation between the two earlier in the day. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had admitted to manslaughter and possessing a knife but denied the murder charge. The jury reached a majority verdict of 11 to 1 after a month-long trial at Sheffield Crown Court, concluding a tragic case of school violence.</p>

          <p>A new dating safety app called Tea, which allows women to anonymously review men and check for "red flags," has surged in popularity but also drawn significant criticism. The app functions as a "Yelp for men," but experts and users have raised serious concerns about privacy, potential for defamation lawsuits, and the commodification of whisper networks. The app recently suffered a cyberattack that exposed user data, highlighting its security vulnerabilities. Critics argue that while intended to enhance safety, the app's design may foster mistrust and oversimplify complex issues of gendered violence.</p>

          <p>On the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers hold little hope for a diplomatic resolution to the war with Russia, even as a U.S. deadline for Moscow arrives. With Russia's forces advancing and Ukraine facing manpower shortages, troops believe defeating Russia militarily is the only viable option. The sentiment on the ground contrasts with diplomatic efforts, including a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Analysts suggest Putin remains uninterested in meaningful peace negotiations, believing time is on Russia's side in the protracted conflict.</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will suspend the approval of arms exports to Israel intended for use in the Gaza Strip. Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the decision was made "until further notice" in response to Israel's plan to expand its military offensive into Gaza City. While affirming Israel's right to self-defense against Hamas, Merz expressed concern that the new military action makes it harder to achieve goals like hostage release. The move marks a significant policy shift for Germany, one of Israel's most steadfast allies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerning economic indicators, including slow job growth and a lower GDP forecast, the U.S. stock market has remained largely stable. Analysts attribute this investor optimism to strong corporate earnings, particularly in the tech sector, and the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market's resilience has created its own momentum, with traders appearing to embrace risk over caution for now. However, concerns about potential "stagflation" persist, as the combination of tariffs and sluggish hiring could pose a difficult challenge for economic policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Israel's plan to take over Gaza City, calling the decision "wrong" and warning it "will only bring more bloodshed." In a statement, Starmer urged the Israeli government to reconsider the move, emphasizing that it will not secure the release of hostages or end the conflict. He reiterated the need for a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, and a negotiated diplomatic solution. The UK's stance puts it at odds with the U.S. on how to address the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have voiced strong opposition to the government's plan to take control of Gaza City, calling it a death sentence for their loved ones. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum stated the decision means "abandoning hostages" and choosing military escalation over a negotiated deal. This sentiment is echoed more broadly across Israel, with polls indicating significant public backlash against the plan. Many citizens believe the top priority should be the safe return of the remaining captives rather than a prolonged and dangerous military operation.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian contends that the widely cited death toll in Gaza, around 60,000, is almost certainly a massive underestimate of the true number of fatalities.

Citing various statistical analyses, the piece suggests the real number could be in the hundreds of thousands.

While this aligns with a government directive to curb such self-destructive competition, industry insiders remain skeptical about the effectiveness of state-led campaigns.

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Canadian tennis player Victoria Mboko completed a remarkable run at the National Bank Open in Montreal, winning her first WTA Tour title. As a wildcard entry ranked 85th, she defeated four Grand Slam champions, including Naomi Osaka in the final, to secure the victory. Her performance, marked by a potent blend of power and discipline, makes her the youngest player to oust four major champions at a single event since Serena Williams in 1999. The win catapults Mboko to a world ranking of No. 24, marking a dramatic rise for the young star.</p>

          <p>Independent Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe has admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted a picture of their boat on social media, stating he had alerted authorities to the "dinghies coming into Great Yarmouth." After HM Coastguard confirmed the crew's identity, it was revealed they were rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. Lowe later apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause.</p>

          <p>The bidding war for Assura, a major landlord for NHS properties, is intensifying as the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigates its proposed takeover. The CMA has blocked rival investor Primary Health Properties (PHP) from fully integrating Assura while it determines if the £1.7bn deal lessens competition. Meanwhile, U.S. private equity firm KKR, which had previously been in a bidding war, is lobbying Assura's board to accept its cash offer instead. The battle for control comes as investment in NHS facilities is a key part of the government's long-term healthcare plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new federal "Standard Repayment Plan" for student loans is set to create a "cliff effect" that could be costly for some borrowers, according to experts. The plan extends repayment terms from the current 10 years up to 25 years, based on the borrower's total debt balance. While this may lower monthly payments for those with higher balances, it will also significantly increase the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan. An expert from TICAS warns that small differences in loan balances can push borrowers into much longer and more expensive repayment tiers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher has invoiced the city of Los Angeles $1.8 million for just 13 days of legal work on a major federal homelessness case. The city retained the high-profile firm in May to defend it against a potential takeover of its homelessness programs by a third-party receiver. Despite the costly legal defense, a federal judge issued a scathing ruling against the city for failing to meet its obligations, though he stopped short of ordering a receivership. The massive legal bill comes as the city faces a severe budget shortfall and employee layoffs.</p>

          <p>At Mono Lake in California, visitors are witnessing the stark environmental consequences of Los Angeles' long-standing water diversions from the region. Since the 1940s, tapping the streams that feed the lake has caused its level to drop by 45 feet, shrinking its volume by half and doubling its salinity. This has exposed unique tufa tower formations and threatened the ecosystem that supports trillions of brine shrimp and migratory birds. Although a 1994 ruling aimed to restore the lake's level, it remains far below the target, prompting calls for a new hearing to reassess water rights.</p>

          <p>A two-decade-old program allowing solo drivers of electric and other clean air vehicles to use California's carpool lanes is set to expire on September 30. The program requires congressional reauthorization, which appears unlikely to pass before the deadline. Over a million decals have been issued, serving as a key incentive for adopting zero-emission vehicles in the state. If the program ends, all vehicles will be required to meet the posted passenger occupancy rules for HOV lanes, potentially impacting the state's progress toward its ambitious environmental goals.</p>
