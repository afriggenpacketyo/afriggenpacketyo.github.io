          <p>Disgraced Chinese admiral Miao Hua, a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC), is under investigation for "legal violations," suggesting more serious wrongdoings than initially suspected. The CMC's political work department expelled Miao from the top legislature in March for ‚Äúsuspected serious violations of discipline and law.‚Äù While his expulsion was previously reported, this is the first official acknowledgement of possible legal misconduct. The case underscores the sensitive nature of military investigations in China, which are handled by a separate, more opaque military justice system.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts could push more children into unpaid family caregiving roles, as high school senior Joshua Yang's experience illustrates, who became his mother's caregiver after a car accident left her with Parkinson's disease. Researchers estimate millions of U.S. children provide care to adults at home, and reduced home care services could increase this number, leading to declines in the children's health and academic outcomes. Some schools are taking notice, with Colorado surveying high schoolers about caregiving and Rhode Island requiring schools to support caregiving students, recognizing the challenges these students face.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to explore new overseas markets and support more efficient production to increase rice exports, addressing an anticipated long-term decline in domestic consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends boosting rice exports, identifying China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as target markets. The government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold by 2030 and reduce production costs to compete with foreign-grown rice. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba supports prioritizing exports from the beginning, rather than only exporting surplus rice.</p>

          <p>A top UN official has accused Israel of subjecting people in Gaza to forced starvation, claiming that this has led to a change in the international response to Gaza. The UN official, Tom Fletcher, believes that Israel is intentionally blocking food from entering Gaza while its population is starving. He called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to disavow statements made by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who suggested Gazans should relocate to begin a new life elsewhere, and ensure that forced displacement is not enacted.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, after nearly 130 days as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has left his role within Donald Trump's administration. At the age of 12, Musk created the video game Blastar, and in 1995, he co-founded Zip2, which sold for around $300 million in 1999. In 2022, he launched a perfume called Burnt Hair, and long before Twitter became X, Musk created X.com, which later merged with Confinity to become PayPal. Musk's personality and accomplishments were partly used as inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Iron Man.</p>

The ruling does not include tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which make up the bulk of UK exports to the US. The UK has a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, but the deal is yet to come into force, and the ruling blocks Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods entering the US.</p>

          <p>The UK's saltmarshes are crucial for locking away climate-warming greenhouse gases, according to a new report from WWF, and they act as natural flood defenses. WWF is advocating for these muddy, tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. This recognition could incentivize the restoration and protection of these sites, as saltmarshes capture carbon in their soils, making them as important as trees for climate mitigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun its first deliberations in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to keep different surnames, but the passage of any of the three bills submitted by opposition parties looks unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains reluctant to allow the change, concerned about its potential impact on family cohesion and traditional values. Despite growing public support, the LDP has yet to reach a consensus on revising the Civil Code, which currently requires married couples to share a single family name.</p>
