          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to gather the necessary votes for a pivotal budget bill central to Donald Trump's agenda, facing a critical July 4th deadline. At least three Republican senators have announced their opposition, threatening the bill's passage in the narrowly divided chamber. The extensive 940-page legislation proposes extending significant tax cuts while also implementing contentious cuts to welfare programs like Medicaid. The outcome remains highly uncertain as party leadership works to persuade the holdouts and secure a majority for the vote.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's version of a major budget bill includes extensions of the 2017 tax cuts and new temporary breaks for tip and overtime income. A significant provision raises the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for certain taxpayers, a compromise with House Republicans. The bill also controversially proposes deep cuts to Medicaid and eliminates the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. While a feared "revenge tax" was removed, pleasing investors, the package faces criticism for its potential impact on national debt and its tendency to favor wealthier families.

He stated that while Iran's capabilities have suffered an important setback, the full extent of the destruction is unknown, and the knowledge and industrial capacity remain. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomatic reconnection and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify remaining materials and activities.

It remains unclear what led to the zoological misidentification by the caller.

          <p>A week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the administration have created confusion about the extent of the damage. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the facilities were "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments suggested a more limited setback of only a few months for Iran's program. Officials later shifted their emphasis, highlighting that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, framing this as a key achievement. The uncertainty persists, particularly regarding the fate of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outperforming the rest of the field by more than half a second. Norris described his lap as nearly perfect and said he felt like his "old self" behind the wheel, a feeling he has missed this season amidst struggles in qualifying. The performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension designed to give him better feedback. His dominant qualifying run places him in a strong position for the race, ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri.</p>

          <p>The wedding celebration of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a stark contrast of glamour and dissent. While A-list celebrities arrived for the lavish events, some Venetian locals and activists protested, citing concerns over over-tourism, climate change, and capitalism. Protesters marched with banners, though plans to disrupt water-taxi routes were dropped. The city's deputy mayor defended the event as "high-quality tourism," and Bezos made a multi-million euro donation to local conservation groups, but the wedding has highlighted ongoing tensions in the fragile city.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, has strongly criticized the expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, calling it "the worst idea ever." He expressed serious fears over player welfare, arguing that the congested fixture calendar provides no real recovery time for players, which could lead to unprecedented injuries. Klopp's comments align with those from players' union Fifpro, which has also voiced concerns about increased workload. He believes the relentless schedule diminishes top performances and ultimately harms the value of the sport itself.</p>

Budapest's mayor supported the event by declaring it a municipal parade, and it drew support from dozens of embassies and EU officials.
