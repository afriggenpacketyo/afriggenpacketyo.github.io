            <p>The Texas House has approved a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition after nearly 11 hours of debate. The bill, passed with an 85-63 vote, will establish taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions with $10,000 vouchers each year. Governor Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dustin Burrows hailed the vote as a historic victory for education, while Democrats criticized the measure as "welfare for the rich," expressing concerns about the impact on public school funding.

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba has sent an offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, a controversial site linked to war. The Yasukuni Shrine honors millions of Japanese war dead, including convicted war criminals, and visits or offerings by Japanese leaders often draw criticism from neighboring countries, particularly China and South Korea, who view it as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The act is likely to stir diplomatic sensitivities, especially given ongoing regional tensions.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russian troops had violated the ceasefire "more than 2,000 times" since the start of Sunday, while Russia's defense ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Despite the announced truce, both sides continue to engage in military actions, highlighting the deep distrust and ongoing conflict between the two nations. US President Donald Trump said that "hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week", without giving further details.</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar has called for the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Klobuchar argues that the administration's refusal to comply with the court order is pushing the US closer to a constitutional crisis. She suggests the appointment of a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for the deportation or their failure to facilitate Ábrego García's return. The call comes amid ongoing legal battles and public debate over immigration policies and the separation of powers.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an extraordinary overnight order temporarily blocking the removal of any alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador. Solicitor General John Sauer criticized the order as "unprecedented" and wrong, arguing that the detainee plaintiffs have no standing to seek an injunction. Sauer implored the justices to limit the sweeping overnight order to only a pause on AEA removals, not any removals of Venezuelan alleged gang members. The court has not given a detailed explanation.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee warned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start. Goolsbee explained that businesses and consumers are preemptively purchasing goods in anticipation of the tariffs, which could inflate economic activity in the short term but lead to a slowdown later on. Sectors affected by the tariffs, particularly the auto industry, are likely to stock up on inventory now before import levies potentially rise further.
