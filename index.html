          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 15:26:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued a new travel ban impacting individuals from 12 countries, marking a revised approach from his initial policy. Legal experts suggest this iteration addresses previous legal vulnerabilities by providing clearer definitions and exemptions. While the original ban faced numerous court challenges, this version appears more legally robust, potentially securing Supreme Court approval if challenged. The key difference lies in the absence of an explicit focus on Muslim-majority nations, which could influence the court's decision. This new ban reflects lessons learned from the past administration's legal battles. Optimism may be tempered by the potential impact on international relations and individual liberties.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled against a lawsuit brought by Mexico against American gun companies, citing a 2005 law that shields gunmakers from liability. Mexico argued that the companies' products are often sold to gun traffickers who supply Mexican drug cartels. The Court's decision relied heavily on the precedent set in Twitter v. Taamneh, emphasizing that providing a good or service to all comers does not create legal responsibility for misuse by bad actors. This ruling limits the ability of foreign governments to hold U.S. gun manufacturers accountable for the consequences of gun sales.</p>

However, economists hold differing views on the effectiveness of tariffs in addressing trade imbalances. The uncertain policy environment and fluctuating consumer attitudes contribute to the complex economic outlook. The trade gap stands well below the level recorded when Trump first took office.</p>
