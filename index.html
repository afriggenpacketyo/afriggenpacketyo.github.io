          <p>Microsoft has announced its entry into the handheld console market with the ROG Xbox Ally, developed in partnership with Asus, after years of speculation. The device will allow gamers to access their Game Pass library on the go and comes in two versions: the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, differing in memory, storage, battery, and processor. The handhelds run Windows, providing access to various gaming platforms like Steam and EA Play, but are heavier than the Nintendo Switch 2. Microsoft also revealed new games coming to Game Pass PC & Ultimate, including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 and Ninja Gaiden 4, but there was no mention of Switch 2 compatibility for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The new Persona 4 remake, subtitled Revival, is set to be remade 17 years after it was first released on PlayStation 2. </p>

          <p>Bulgarian officials rescued 75 people from two illegal care homes described as "houses of horrors," where residents were subjected to mistreatment, including beatings, sedation, and being bound. The facilities were converted into health centers, offering rooms for rent at a monthly cost. Victims were found locked in rooms without bedding and cut off from the outside world, with some residents not having left the premises for years. Five people have been arrested, and an investigation into kidnapping, violence, and negligence has been launched, with inspections of other nursing homes underway to combat property fraud targeting vulnerable individuals. International organizations have often criticized the poor state of health facilities in Bulgaria, leading to the development of illegal centers.</p>

Huang emphasized the UK's rich AI community, including startups like DeepMind and Wayve, but noted a lack of homegrown AI infrastructure. Nvidia unveiled a new UK sovereign AI industry forum and commitments from cloud vendors Nscale and Nebius to deploy facilities with Blackwell GPU chips. The UK government aims to boost the domestic AI sector, relaxing planning rules for data centers and increasing computing power by twenty-fold by 2030. Huang believes the ability to build AI supercomputers in the UK will attract more startups.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles intensified following the deployment of the National Guard in response to President Trump's immigration crackdown, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Demonstrators blocked a major freeway, set self-driving cars on fire, and vandalized buildings, while police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Governor Newsom requested the removal of the Guard, calling their deployment a breach of state sovereignty, while Mayor Bass blamed the administration for provoking chaos. The protests, sparked by federal agents arresting immigrants in the LA area, have led to over 100 arrests, including a union leader, and have drawn criticism from Democratic figures like Maxine Waters and Kamala Harris. The situation remains tense as officials debate the necessity and impact of the National Guard's presence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed spending bill is facing opposition in the Senate due to disagreements among Republicans over tax cuts, immigration enforcement, and defense spending, with concerns about increasing the national debt.

Critics, including Elon Musk, have called for lawmakers to reject the bill, which is projected to increase the deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade. The bill also includes measures that could lead to millions losing health insurance and disproportionately benefit top earners while reducing access to public benefits for lower-income individuals.

Studies show mixed results, with some indicating CGMs can aid in weight loss and blood sugar control, while others suggest they offer no significant advantage over traditional diets. Experts recommend CGMs for those sensitive to carbohydrates, needing motivation to eat healthier, or seeking increased dietary awareness, but caution against potential data misinterpretation and unnecessary anxiety about normal blood sugar fluctuations.

Legal experts worry that this trend could undermine constitutional checks on executive power, with challenges to Trump's emergency orders making their way through the courts. Critics argue that many of these declarations do not constitute genuine emergencies and should be addressed through congressional legislation. While the White House defends Trump's actions as necessary to address crises, others see them as an overreach of presidential authority.</p>
