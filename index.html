          <p>Eli Sharabi, a former Israeli hostage whose family was killed by Hamas, voiced his deep concern that the latest peace plan to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas might fail. Sharabi, who spent 491 days in captivity, emphasized the risk to the remaining hostages and urged US President Donald Trump to intervene. The proposed 20-point plan involves a hostage release in exchange for detained Gazans and Palestinian prisoners. Sharabi, who discovered his family's death upon release, has since advocated for the hostages' release, even meeting with President Trump, showing resilience in the face of profound loss.

          <p>A report assessing Germany 35 years after reunification highlights persistent disparities between the former East and West, particularly for younger generations. While Germany is formally united, the report indicates that young people in eastern Germany still identify strongly with their regional background. Lower incomes, fewer opportunities, and less inherited wealth contribute to ongoing disadvantages in the East. The report suggests policies like an "inheritance for everyone" to address these inequalities and foster true unity. The article examines the complex social and economic factors shaping Germany's continued division. Optimism score is self-contained.</p>
