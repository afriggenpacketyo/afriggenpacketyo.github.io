          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order stopping the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests across seven California counties. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups, which argued that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on race and denying detainees access to legal counsel. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims, requiring agents to have reasonable suspicion for stops and ensuring attorney access at a Los Angeles detention facility.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are scrutinizing the safety of portable power banks following several incidents where devices caught fire on commercial flights. In response, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has banned passengers from carrying substandard power banks, specifically those lacking the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. This has led to confusion and large numbers of abandoned devices at airports, adding to existing regulations that already prohibit charging these devices during flights.</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has burned over 10,000 acres near Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, prompting the evacuation of the park's North Rim. Sparked by lightning, the blaze remains uncontained due to high temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions, creating a dangerous situation for the region. Officials have closed a nearby state highway and evacuated hundreds of guests, as similar lightning-ignited fires also force evacuations in a Colorado national park.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data showing a dip in UK growth, combined with a stark report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has set a gloomy tone for the upcoming autumn budget. The OBR warned that government debt could soar and that current spending promises are unaffordable, suggesting significant tax rises of £10bn to £20bn may be necessary. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces the difficult task of stabilizing public finances amid rising borrowing costs and global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature two first-time finalists: five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically struggled on grass but has found her form, while Anisimova is fulfilling her early potential after a break for mental health. Analysts suggest the match will be a contest between Swiatek's experience and tactical maturity versus Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style as the underdog.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is charting a new foreign policy course, emphasizing national sovereignty and an "Australia first" doctrine amid rising US-China tensions. Drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese aims to recalibrate relationships with both allies and rivals, asserting that Australia must shape its own future based on strategic reality rather than tradition. This approach comes as his government navigates the complexities of the AUKUS security pact while also engaging in diplomatic visits to Beijing.</p>

This move represents a significant escalation of trade tensions and is part of a broader strategy of imposing higher tariffs on numerous countries to renegotiate trade deals.
