          <p>Houthi media reports that a U.S. strike in Yemen hit a migrant detention center in Saada, causing numerous deaths and injuries among African migrants. The U.S. military has been conducting near-daily strikes against the Houthis since mid-March as part of Operation Rough Rider, aimed at curbing their attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. CENTCOM claims these strikes have significantly degraded the Houthis' ability to launch attacks, while the Houthis continue to target U.S. and Israeli vessels in solidarity with Palestinians.

          <p>China is experiencing a continued decline in marriage registrations, prompting local governments to offer financial incentives to encourage young couples to tie the knot. In the first quarter of 2025, marriage registrations fell by 8% compared to the previous year, while divorce registrations increased by 10%. To combat this trend, China has streamlined marriage registration rules, allowing couples to register without returning to their place of household residency. These measures aim to address the country's demographic challenges, including low birth rates and a shrinking population. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>Timothy Garton Ash argues for a global liberal fightback against the growing strength of anti-liberal powers, including the United States under Donald Trump. He emphasizes the need for unity among liberals to counter the raw assertion of might from Washington, Moscow, and Beijing. Ash suggests that the European Union, Canada, Japan, and Australia can form coalitions of counter-power, promoting free trade, regulating monopolistic platforms, and supporting Ukraine. The article calls for a renewed commitment to liberal values and a rejection of simplistic, populist solutions. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Andy Beckett argues that populist politics, while initially appealing with promises of simplicity and liberation, often leads to increased hassle and chaos. Populist governments tend to create more bureaucracies, strict controls, and interventionist policies. The desire to control immigration, for example, results in new bureaucracies and enforcement bodies. The author suggests that centrists need to offer a positive alternative to the pessimistic xenophobia of populism by acknowledging the complexities of the modern world and providing a better life for more people.
