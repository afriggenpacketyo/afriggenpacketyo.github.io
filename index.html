          <h2>India and US Consider Zero-Tariff Trade Deal Amidst Economic Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 03:04:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering a zero-tariff trade agreement with the U.S. on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a shift from its protectionist policies as India looks to scale its economic growth from 6% to 8-9% and needs foreign investment. While some experts believe this deal could significantly benefit sectors like financials, materials, and healthcare, others are skeptical about the substantial impact on India's domestic manufacturing, particularly in steel and pharmaceuticals, but logistics companies may benefit from increased trade. The U.S. remains India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024, and India seeks to loosen its protectionist stance to reduce regulatory burden.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a notable surge in April, driven primarily by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which helped offset a significant decline in exports to the U.S. due to rising tariffs. Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged by over 21% year-on-year, while exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%. This shift suggests a redirection of trade flows and potential transshipment through third countries. Despite the overall export growth, analysts anticipate a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months as the full impact of tariffs becomes more evident.</p>

As the Arctic warms and Russia expands its presence, Greenland's proximity to both Russia and the U.S. becomes increasingly significant. The Trump administration is considering unilateral action, raising concerns among NATO allies. A potential solution involves applying the Compact of Free Association model used in the Pacific to balance U.S. interests with international concerns.</p>
