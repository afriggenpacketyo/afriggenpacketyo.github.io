            <p>The stock market experienced a sharp decline as President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates. This occurred amidst ongoing tariff uncertainty and ahead of major tech companies' earnings releases, contributing to investor unease. Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, despite the Fed's concerns about inflation, has fueled worries about the central bank's independence. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all saw significant drops, reflecting investor anxiety over potential economic impacts from tariffs and the Fed-White House conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With the Real ID deadline just weeks away, many states are still not fully compliant, raising concerns about potential disruptions at airport security checkpoints. As of a recent analysis, numerous states have compliance rates below 50%, meaning a significant portion of travelers may face delays or be unable to pass through security. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to enhance the security of state-issued identification, and the deadline has been extended multiple times. Travelers without a Real ID will be subject to secondary screening, which could cause significant delays.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case that challenges the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which determines which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The case could impact access to free preventive care services, such as cancer screenings and HIV-prevention drugs, if the court upholds a lower court's ruling. Arguments center on whether the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause, as its members are not appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The decision, expected by the end of June, could have significant ramifications for healthcare access.</p>

            <p>The "magic number" needed for a comfortable retirement has fallen to $1.26 million, but Americans are less confident they can reach it.

            <p>Experts are divided on whether mortgage rates will drop below 6% soon, with some believing it's possible due to cooling inflation and potential Fed rate cuts. Others remain skeptical, citing economic uncertainty and persistent inflation. Factors influencing mortgage rates include inflation, Federal Reserve policy, and the 10-year Treasury bond market. The consensus is that timing the market for the "perfect" rate is risky, and borrowers should focus on affordability and long-term financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US stocks and the dollar have plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on US central bank boss calling him "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates. Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. The president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil. Though the dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence.</p>
