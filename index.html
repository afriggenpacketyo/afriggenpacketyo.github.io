        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests following ICE operations, with Governor Newsom criticizing the move as inflammatory. President Trump cited the inability of California's governor and Los Angeles' mayor to handle the situation, while Newsom stated that the federal government is creating chaos. The deployment involves 2,000 National Guard troops under Title 10 authority, bypassing the need for the governor's approval, a move that waives the Posse Comitatus Act. The protests erupted after ICE conducted raids in multiple Los Angeles districts, resulting in numerous arrests, with clashes between protesters and authorities, including the use of tear gas and arrests for assault on peace officers.</p>

          <p>Two sisters from Pontardawe, Wales, are dealing with the emotional fallout after their mother was jailed for stealing their £50,000 inheritance left to them by their grandmother. Katherine Hill and her father Gerald Hill were convicted of fraud after draining the trust fund intended for Gemma and Jessica Thomas, leaving the sisters feeling anxious and unable to trust anyone. The sisters recalled a close relationship with their mother before the theft, which involved extravagant spending on a garden pub and hot tub. The theft was discovered when Gemma inquired about accessing the funds, leading to a series of lies and a strained relationship with their mother, who showed no remorse for her actions.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on halving the time required to apply for citizenship, a move supported by civil society groups but boycotted by the hard-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. The referendum proposes reducing the wait time from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European countries, but requires a 50% voter turnout to be valid. Meloni has called the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open," while others claim the reform would integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the economy. The outcome of the referendum remains uncertain, with potential implications for up to 1.4 million people living and working in Italy.</p>

The rapper's lyrics became increasingly political, criticizing the authorities, leading to his arrest and death sentence, which has drawn international condemnation. From a music video on a warship to exile, Tataloo's journey reflects the tumultuous political landscape of Iran, where his rebellious music resonated with disenfranchised young people.</p>

          <p>The UK's plan to modernise its nuclear arsenal, unveiled in the 2025 strategic defence review, undermines international non-proliferation efforts and fuels a global arms race, according to Simon Tisdall. This decision, driven by perceived threats, could lead to the deployment of lower-yield tactical nukes, normalising nuclear warfare. Spending an additional £15bn on nuclear warheads for submarines diverts resources from essential services and perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power status. Critics argue that retaining nuclear weapons does not enhance Britain's safety and that gradual disarmament is the only way to escape the nightmare of nuclear warfare.</p>

          <p>President Trump has more than doubled his personal wealth since starting his 2024 election campaign, with billions of foreign dollars flowing into his family’s real estate and crypto ventures. Critics argue that this self-dealing poses a fundamental danger, transforming the political system into something that no longer serves the people. The United States is seemingly becoming just another country with a corrupt strongman personalizing and profiting from power, mirroring the playbooks of leaders like Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban. This fusion of political and personal interests erodes checks and balances, weakens the justice system, and leads to moral and ethical frameworks being ignored.</p>

          <p>President Trump is deploying federal force in California, ordering 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles amidst immigration protests. The move reflects a widening gulf between California's political leaders and the federal government, with Governor Newsom accusing the White House of "sowing chaos." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that active-duty Marines were placed on "high alert" for mobilization, prompting Newsom to condemn the threat of deploying Marines against U.S. citizens. The Los Angeles Police Department reported the demonstrations as "peaceful," contradicting the president's characterization of the situation.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack targeting Moscow forced the closure of two key airports serving the capital, according to Russian authorities. Russian air defence units destroyed nine Ukrainian drones heading towards Moscow, with emergency services dispatched to the sites where drone debris fell. A Ukrainian drone attack also sparked a fire at the Azot chemical plant in the Tula region, injuring two people, and seven drones were destroyed over the Kaluga region. Russia and Ukraine have increased their attacks in recent weeks while also returning to peace talks.</p>

          <p>Israel is facing accusations of committing war crimes in Gaza, raising concerns among international bodies and governments about potential complicity. The conflict has resulted in a high number of Palestinian casualties, including children, and severe restrictions on aid shipments, leading to famine-like conditions. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) believes Israel is flouting the Geneva Conventions, setting a dangerous precedent for conflicts worldwide. There are also allegations of genocide, with some lawyers arguing that statements by Israeli leaders suggest an intent to force the Arab population of Gaza to leave.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used tellurium, a rare mineral produced mostly in China, to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them “super vision”. The nanowire implants, made from tellurium, convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, replacing photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement offers significant promise for treating human blindness, with the potential to restore vision and provide the ability to see “invisible” light.

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles has sparked legal debate, with Governor Newsom opposing the move.

Critics argue that the deployment is unnecessary and inflammatory, while supporters claim it is necessary to enforce immigration laws.

          <p>Subsidising men’s participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, according to a new study co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong.

The findings come as China faces a rapidly ageing population, shrinking workforce and strained social welfare system, with the overall fertility rate estimated at 1.1 children per woman.</p>

While intermittent fasting is often marketed as a tool for weight loss and improving metabolic health, it can become problematic, especially for those with a history of eating disorders. The restrictive nature of intermittent fasting can serve as a socially acceptable disguise for disordered eating behaviors, potentially leading to long-term struggles with food and body image.

          <p>AI scientist De Kai advocates for a paradigm shift in how we approach artificial intelligence, suggesting we “parent” these systems as if they were our children. De Kai argues that AI is a change to the social climate that humanity is competing in, requiring us to be conscientious about who we are around our AI “children.” The new book, Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future, emphasizes the importance of good role models for AI systems, given their learning from our online activities.</p>
