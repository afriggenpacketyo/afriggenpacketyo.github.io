            <p>Goldman Sachs reports that US retail investors hold approximately US$370 billion in American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese companies, making them susceptible to sell-offs if the Trump administration pursues financial decoupling. Companies with high retail exposure, like Alibaba, would be most vulnerable. The report also suggests a broader financial decoupling could trigger a US$2.5 trillion sell-off in both Chinese and US markets, as some US retail investors might struggle to convert their ADRs into Hong Kong-listed shares. US institutional investors hold a combined US$830 billion in ADRs, Hong Kong-listed shares, and onshore shares. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Seventeen international students have filed a federal lawsuit in Georgia against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), alleging illegal termination of their student visas without due process. The students claim their legal status was stripped via the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) despite compliance with visa terms. The lawsuit asserts that students were flagged in criminal record checks without formal charges or deportable offenses. Attorneys seek a temporary restraining order to reinstate SEVIS registrations and restore legal status, arguing removal jeopardizes education, residency, employment, and reentry into the U.S.</p>

            <p>Serena Williams expressed her belief that she would have faced a significantly harsher penalty, including a longer ban and loss of Grand Slam titles, if she had committed the same anti-doping offense as Jannik Sinner. Sinner, currently serving a three-month ban for testing positive for clostebol, was cleared of fault by the ITIA, leading to a shorter ban. Williams, who previously claimed discrimination due to frequent drug tests, stated that a similar situation during her career would have resulted in severe consequences. She acknowledged Sinner's importance to men's tennis but highlighted the perceived disparity in treatment.</p>

            <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has stated it will pursue the NHS if the organization does not update its gender policies to align with a recent UK Supreme Court ruling. The ruling defines "woman" as a biological female under equalities law, potentially impacting access to single-sex spaces. The EHRC is developing updated guidance for public bodies, including the NHS and prisons, expecting it to be in place by the summer. The chairwoman of the EHRC, Baroness Kishwer Falkner, emphasized that single-sex services must be based on biological sex if male persons are allowed access.</p>

            <p>China's growing political, economic, and cultural ties with the Americas are viewed by some as a net positive for the region, despite concerns from the United States. China's diplomatic approach focuses on major powers, neighboring countries, the developing world, and multilateral diplomacy. The US has historically attempted to limit external powers' influence in the Western Hemisphere, echoing the Monroe Doctrine. However, critics argue the Monroe Doctrine became a tool for US imperialism, leading to interventions in Latin American nations to protect American business interests.</p>

            <p>The UK government has implemented a temporary ban on travelers bringing cheese and meat products from the EU to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease (FMD). This restriction follows a similar ban on products from Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria due to rising FMD cases. The ban applies to Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, and includes pork, beef, lamb, and dairy products. Violators may face fines up to £5,000, with seized products being destroyed, while the National Farmers Union supports the measure.</p>

Beijing has also placed dozens of US businesses on an "unreliable entity" list, restricting their ability to trade or invest in China.

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump amid a trade standoff between the U.S. and Europe.

            <p>As his enemies closed in on Damascus, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad allegedly used a private jet to smuggle cash, valuables, and confidential documents out of the country. According to a Reuters investigation, the operation involved four flights to the United Arab Emirates carrying unmarked bags of cash, intelligence documents, and presidential palace personnel. The operation was orchestrated by Assad's top economic advisor, Yasar Ibrahim, who is accused of creating a network of entities used to control Syria's economy. Assad has been granted political asylum in Russia, and the new Syrian government seeks to recover the funds taken abroad.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney has requested a pause in the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing to review a recently completed parole board assessment. The motion stems from the brothers' appeal for clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who ordered a risk assessment as a step toward clemency. The DA argues that the court should possess the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions. Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 killings of their parents, a case that has seen several twists and turns in the legal process.</p>

            <p>Scammers are using fake banking apps to deceive sellers in person by faking bank transfers. These apps mimic legitimate mobile banking platforms, displaying a "successful payment" message to the seller before the scammer leaves with the goods. Victims have lost thousands of pounds worth of items, leading to feelings of anger and vulnerability. Police have been unable to identify the suspects in many cases, and tech companies are being urged to take more action to prevent fraud on online platforms. UK Finance advises sellers not to be pressured into accepting bank transfers and to verify payments in their own accounts before handing over goods.</p>

            <p>A trade deal with the US under President Trump may not be as beneficial for the UK as some believe. The article argues that Trump's approach to trade is about asserting power, potentially leading to the UK becoming a loser in any deal. While a limited trade agreement could protect British interests, it is unlikely to be the key to unlocking UK prosperity. The author suggests focusing on resetting relations with the EU, even if it risks being seen as a hostile act by Trump's Washington.</p>
