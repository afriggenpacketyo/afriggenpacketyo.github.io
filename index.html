          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, Â£500 million contract to supply Network Rail with train tracks, securing thousands of jobs and the short-term future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The agreement, commencing July 1st, ensures British Steel will continue providing 80% of Network Rail's track needs. The government intervened to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by Jingye, British Steel's Chinese owner, underscoring the strategic importance of domestic steel production. This deal demonstrates the government's commitment to strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains, particularly after the closure of Port Talbot's blast furnaces in 2024. The contract guarantees work for the Scunthorpe plant, the last in the UK producing virgin steel, for at least five years.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the killing of General Ali Shadmani, whom they identified as the head of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in a strike on Tehran. The IDF described Shadmani as Iran's top general, but Iran has not immediately acknowledged the reported death. If confirmed, this would mark another high-ranking Iranian military figure killed in Israeli strikes, further escalating tensions between the two nations.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po will attend the signing of an action plan for collaborative development between the two cities. The agreement will outline a plan for cooperation across multiple layers and fields, with speculation suggesting an expansion of "connect" schemes for cross-border trading and trials of financial derivative products involving foreign currencies and commodities. This collaboration is viewed as a strategic move to better cope with the risk of financial decoupling from the U.S., where Chinese companies face potential delisting.</p>

He noted that Israel has demolished a significant portion of Iran's surface-to-surface missile systems and targeted the broadcast center in Tehran after warning residents to evacuate.

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles that has successfully intercepted thousands of rockets fired at Israel. However, building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's larger size and the different types of missiles that could be used in an attack. Experts suggest that the scale of the project would be vastly different, comparing it to the difference between a kayak and a battleship.</p>

Despite facing an oppressive government, Iran had been experiencing slow but steady progress in its political, economic, and social conditions. The election of President Masoud Pezeshkian aimed to repair Iran's social contract, and there had been modest economic recovery and improved foreign relations. However, the Israeli attacks have undermined these efforts and prevented a potential nuclear agreement between the U.S. and Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, ranging from strong support for Israel to distancing himself from the attacks. This article explores Trump's potential options, including escalating the conflict under pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining the current course, or pulling back due to domestic concerns. Trump's unpredictability is seen by some as a strategic tactic, while others believe he may ultimately side with military action despite previous diplomatic efforts. Domestic political factors, particularly within the "Make America Great Again" movement, also influence Trump's decision-making process.</p>
