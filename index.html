          <p>Intel announced third-quarter sales that surpassed analyst predictions, indicating a recovery in demand for its PC processors. This marks the company's first earnings report since the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake through an $8.9 billion investment, a transaction for which Intel is still seeking accounting guidance from the SEC. The chipmaker's results were also bolstered by a $5 billion investment from rival Nvidia, with whom it will collaborate on integrating CPUs with AI GPUs. Despite a slight decline in its foundry division sales, the company projects continued strong demand for its chips into the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers represented by the Starbucks Workers United union are set to vote on authorizing a national strike amid stalled contract negotiations. The union, which represents 12,000 employees across 550 cafes, is demanding increased hours, higher pay, and a resolution to what it calls unfair labor practices by the company. Negotiations that began in May 2024 have been unsuccessful, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress. This vote could lead to the union's third major national strike this year, following walkouts in May and December of the previous year.</p>

Pritzker has signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to create a public record of alleged civil rights abuses by federal immigration agents. The move is a response to Operation Midway Blitz, which Pritzker claims involves ICE and CBP officers unlawfully targeting individuals based on their race. The commission, led by a former federal chief judge, will collect evidence like videos and firsthand accounts for potential future legal action. A top CBP official defended the enforcement actions, describing them as targeting serious criminals and dismissing the governor's claims as "fake news."</p>

          <p>Target has announced its first major layoffs in a decade, cutting 1,800 corporate jobs as it grapples with four years of stagnant sales. The move, which affects about 8% of its headquarters workforce, is part of a broader strategy by incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to simplify operations and accelerate growth. The company stated that the cuts are a necessary step to reduce complexity that has slowed decision-making. These layoffs do not impact employees in Target's stores or supply chain, and affected corporate staff will receive severance packages.</p>

          <p>Following a significant single-day price drop, investors are evaluating the merits of buying gold from retailers like Costco. The article suggests that a temporary dip in gold's price generally presents a good buying opportunity, regardless of the seller, due to the metal's historical tendency to rebound. Purchasing from Costco offers accessibility and potential transparency compared to other vendors, though sales are final. While retailers provide a straightforward way to acquire physical bullion, specialized gold investing companies can offer a wider range of options, such as ETFs and IRAs, along with expert guidance.

The continued violence has resulted in hundreds of deaths since the deal was signed, with the UN documenting numerous projectiles fired from both sides.

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, but the automaker lowered its full-year guidance for 2025. The revision is due to production disruptions caused by a fire at the plant of a key aluminum supplier, Novelis, which is expected to cost the company up to $2 billion. Ford plans to mitigate the impact by increasing truck production in 2026 once the supply chain stabilizes. Despite the setback, the company's Q3 revenue reached a record $50.5 billion, and it noted a smaller-than-expected impact from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent sharp swings in the price of gold, driven by factors like Federal Reserve rate cuts and stock market performance, are creating opportunities for nimble investors. One strategy is to trade the stocks of gold mining companies, which often move with greater leverage than the commodity itself. Another approach involves using gold-backed ETFs or futures for short-term plays that mirror the metal's spot price with high liquidity. For long-term investors, buying physical gold during price dips remains a viable strategy to hedge against economic uncertainty, though it involves additional costs for storage and security.

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release its delayed September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, with economists forecasting a 3.1% annual inflation rate, the highest since May 2024. The release was postponed due to the government shutdown but is proceeding because the data is required to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits. The expected 2.7% COLA will increase monthly payments for 75 million recipients. Economists note that U.S. tariffs have contributed to the upward trend in inflation, with companies passing a significant portion of the costs onto consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and served a four-month prison sentence as part of a settlement with the Justice Department. The White House claimed Zhao was a victim of the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency" and that there were no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims. The pardon comes as the Trump family has business ties to the crypto industry, including a venture that uses a stablecoin involved in a deal to purchase a stake in Binance.</p>

The movie, adapted from the Korean satire "Save the Green Planet!," serves as a dark comedy exploring themes of online brain rot, class disparity, and the human need for purpose.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's major state-owned oil companies, including PetroChina and Sinopec, have reportedly halted purchases of seaborne Russian oil in response to new U.S. sanctions against Moscow's largest energy firms, Rosneft and Lukoil. This move follows a similar decision by refiners in India, Russia's other top customer, which will likely strain Moscow's oil revenues significantly. The suspension of purchases by these key buyers is expected to force them to seek alternative supplies from the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. This shift in demand could potentially drive up global oil prices as competition for non-sanctioned crude increases.</p>

          <p>Parenting toddlers can be challenging due to their rapidly changing emotions and defiant behaviors, such as constantly saying "no" or claiming everything as "mine." According to child development experts, these actions are a normal and necessary part of a child's journey to establish their own identity and independence. Understanding that this boundary-pushing is a form of social and emotional learning can help parents respond more strategically and with less frustration. The article offers tips for handling these situations, such as modeling calm responses and offering limited, positive choices to give toddlers a sense of agency.</p>

The search for a new leader is now expected to take several months as the government plans to re-engage with survivors for their input. The turmoil deepened as four members of the inquiry's survivor panel resigned, calling for the resignation of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, whom they accused of betrayal. However, other survivors have written in support of Phillips, highlighting deep divisions within the group advising the high-profile investigation.</p>

          <p>California will now permit the hunting of mute swans at any time of year in an effort to control the invasive species. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has classified the birds as "destructive" and "detrimental," noting that their population has grown to nearly 7,000 since they were first observed in 2007. The swans are territorial and compete with native species for limited submerged aquatic vegetation. Under the new legislation, which expires in 2031, anyone with a valid hunting license can kill the swans, and landowners can do so without a permit.</p>

While allocations to alternatives like gold and crypto are still relatively small, typically 1-7% of a portfolio, their adoption by mainstream investors is growing as a direct response to the imbalance in traditional equity markets.

While acknowledging the financial pressure on federal employees working without pay, Duffy stated he wants controllers focused on their single, high-stress job to ensure aviation safety. The strain on controllers is contributing to flight delays and cancellations, as the department deliberately slows air traffic to maintain safety standards with potentially fatigued or distracted staff.

The decision is seen as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie, who had advocated for partnership with federal agencies rather than a military-style presence.
