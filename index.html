          <p>A federal judge has permitted lawyers to pursue contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for deporting a Venezuelan migrant to El Salvador, in violation of a court order. The migrant, "Cristian," was subsequently sent from El Salvador to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap, a move his lawyers called an "egregious violation" of the order to return him to the U.S. The judge criticized the administration for its lack of compliance and will require weekly updates on his status.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have used a rare judicial power to remove interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal lawyer to President Trump, from her position.

The move followed a 120-day interim period for Habba, whose formal nomination was not yet confirmed by the Senate and was opposed by the state's Democratic senators.

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of completing a £63.5m deal to sign striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting, following extended negotiations over the transfer's finer details. The Sweden international has already agreed to a five-year contract with the Premier League club. Manager Mikel Arteta has been keen to add an elite center-forward to his squad after Gyokeres' impressive season in Portugal, where he scored 54 goals in 52 games, and the signing is expected to bolster Arsenal's attacking options for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings from a $20,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) today versus a year ago, highlighting a noticeable decline in rates. It provides specific calculations showing that while current CD rates are lower, they still offer substantial and guaranteed returns, significantly higher than rates from the early 2020s. The piece suggests that with the possibility of future interest rate cuts, now may still be an opportune time for savers to lock in a fixed, predictable return on their savings.

          <p>The ongoing controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein is reportedly causing friction in the relationship between Donald Trump and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The strain became public after Murdoch's Wall Street Journal published a story about a lewd birthday message Trump allegedly sent to Epstein in 2003. In response, Trump publicly criticized Murdoch, called the story fake, and filed a lawsuit against the newspaper, signaling a significant rift in a long-standing and powerful political-media alliance.

          <p>A recently passed bill has created a new federal student loan repayment option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which will become available by July 2026. This income-driven plan calculates monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% and a minimum of $10 per month. The plan offers loan forgiveness after 30 years and provides some benefits, such as a monthly bill reduction for dependents. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP may become one of the few affordable choices for new borrowers.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's policy toward Ukraine is inconsistent, creating uncertainty for Kyiv. While the administration recently approved the transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems, it simultaneously gave Russia a 50-day period to negotiate before facing new sanctions, effectively allowing Moscow to continue its attacks through the summer. The article suggests that despite occasional gestures of support, Trump's actions create significant obstacles for Ukraine's defense. It concludes that this approach strings Ukraine along without providing the decisive aid needed to win the war.</p>
