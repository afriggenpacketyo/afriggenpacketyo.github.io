The company reported earnings per share and revenue that significantly surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue climbing 33% year-over-year. Affirm also achieved operating income profitability for the quarter, meeting a goal it had set a year prior. This positive financial performance comes amid growing competition in the e-commerce sector and a recent shift by partner Walmart to a rival service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media to explain the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Jones asserted that the move, which brought Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark and future first-round draft picks to Dallas, gives the team a better chance to succeed both now and in the future. He emphasized the need to improve the team's run defense, a persistent weakness, and suggested the acquired draft picks could yield multiple outstanding players. Jones maintained that the decision was a consensus among the front office and coaching staff.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still in a protracted battle with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for rebuilding funds. Mayor Andrew Gilich states the city is owed $34 million to complete crucial upgrades to its sewage and stormwater systems, but disputes over costs and documentation have stalled the project. Biloxi is one of over 250 municipalities in the region with unfinished Katrina relief projects, highlighting ongoing systemic issues within FEMA. The agency has acknowledged the delays as unacceptable and points to a new review council aimed at improving its processes.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley played a part in igniting the 6,800-acre Pickett fire. The fire started on the winery's property, and a source indicated that investigators are looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard were the cause. A spokesperson for the winery confirmed cooperation with the investigation but declined to comment on the specific cause. The Pickett fire, which is now 33% contained, has threatened hundreds of buildings and wineries in the region, though no structures have been reported destroyed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its long-standing policy that guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers, a move that advocates say will create financial and accessibility barriers. Under the new rules effective in January, a refund for a second seat will only be issued if the flight departs with at least one open seat. This change, part of a broader policy update ahead of the airline's transition to assigned seating, has been described as 'heartbreaking' by community advocates.

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of video footage has determined that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack, contrary to initial reports of two strikes. The investigation found that two separate staircases were hit almost simultaneously, followed nine minutes later by a rapid double-strike on an area where first responders and journalists had gathered. The attack, which killed at least 20 people including five journalists, has drawn international condemnation. Israel's narrative has evolved, with the IDF eventually stating its troops had identified a Hamas camera in the area, though legal experts question if this justifies the attack on a protected hospital.</p>

The initial 3-2 board vote in favor of the flag display was part of a broader resolution to combat antisemitism but proved controversial.

          <p>On his show, Jim Cramer encouraged investors to maintain faith in high-quality growth stocks, using the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia as his primary example. Despite a slight dip in the company's stock after a strong earnings report, Cramer argued that Nvidia's dominance in the generative AI market positions it for continued long-term success. He believes the technology is still in its early stages and will revolutionize numerous industries, from manufacturing to law. Cramer's advice centers on trusting the market and holding onto strong companies to avoid missing out on significant gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent months at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been marked by significant upheaval, culminating in the ousting of its director, Dr. Susan Monarez, and the resignation of four other senior officials. A timeline of events reveals a period of mass layoffs, the controversial dismissal of the agency's entire vaccine advisory panel, and major changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. At the center of these changes is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has stated his goal is to reform the agency and restore public trust, though his actions have been met with widespread criticism from the public health community.</p>

          <p>During the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, older middle school students have been lauded as heroes for protecting younger children. According to officials and parents, as the gunfire began, these students immediately pushed their younger 'buddies' under the pews and shielded them with their own bodies. This 'buddy system,' a school tradition pairing older and younger students for church services, is credited with saving lives, though it also resulted in many of the middle schoolers being among the injured. The two children killed in the attack were 8 and 10 years old.</p>

          <p>An angler in Lake Huron discovered an unusually large grass carp, an invasive species that poses a significant threat to the Great Lakes ecosystem. The fish measured over 1.2 meters long and weighed 26 kilograms, making it one of the largest specimens ever processed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Although this particular fish was sterile, the species is known for its voracious appetite, consuming up to 40% of its body weight in aquatic vegetation daily. This behavior destroys fish habitats, clouds water, and can lead to harmful algal blooms, endangering native species.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's new Netflix film, 'Jay Kelly,' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to largely positive reviews, with some critics hailing it as a 'midlife crisis masterpiece.' In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging, successful movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own career. The film also stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, and early reactions suggest Clooney's subtle performance could place him in contention for awards season. The film explores themes of identity, celebrity, and the gap between one's public persona and private self.</p>

          <p>A new survey of 8,000 Americans indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology may be a net negative for the brand's appeal. The poll found that 35% of consumers were less likely to buy a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% said it made them more likely to purchase one. The results come as Tesla faces a sales slump and reputational challenges, with nearly half of those surveyed believing FSD technology should be illegal. This consumer skepticism presents a significant hurdle for the company, as CEO Elon Musk has stated that Tesla's future hinges on its ability to deliver autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake does not have the authority to unilaterally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA), Michael Abramowitz. The judge stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a bipartisan advisory panel, which President Trump has effectively dismantled by dismissing most of its members. The ruling is part of a larger legal battle over Lake's efforts to drastically reduce the operations of VOA, a move the judge suggested violates statutory requirements.

          <p>A recent analysis highlights the complex 'love-hate' relationship between China and Japan, 80 years after the end of World War II. This dynamic is exemplified by the simultaneous success of a blockbuster Chinese film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities, 'Dead to Rights,' and a surge in Chinese tourists visiting Japan, making them the top source of inbound tourism. This paradox illustrates how deep-seated historical wounds and geopolitical tensions coexist with strong economic interdependence and cultural affinity. The relationship remains a delicate balance of remembrance, resentment, and modern-day exchange between the two nations.</p>
