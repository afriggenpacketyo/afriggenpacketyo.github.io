          <p>A professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, has filed a lawsuit against the university for suspending her over online comments about Israel’s war in Gaza, claiming a violation of her freedom of speech rights. Rupa Marya, an expert in decolonial theory, was placed on leave after questioning the impacts of Zionism on healthcare. The university published a statement condemning such comments as a "tired and racist conspiracy theory." Marya's attorney argues that her firing threatens the right to advocate for justice.</p>

          <p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter captured a first-of-its-kind image of Arsia Mons, a 12-mile-high volcano on Mars, poking through clouds at dawn. The image provides an unprecedented view of the volcano on the planet's horizon. Arsia Mons is often surrounded by water ice clouds, especially in the early morning, and is twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano. The angle of the camera allows scientists to observe changes in dust and water ice cloud layers over the course of seasons, providing new clues about Mars' atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Israel announced the retrieval of the body of a Thai hostage, Nattapong Pinta, who was abducted into Gaza during the October 7, 2023, attack. The recovery operation occurred as Israel continued its military offensive, resulting in additional Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's health ministry. Hamas issued a warning regarding another hostage, stating that Israel would be responsible for any harm to him during a rescue attempt. The recovery of Pinta's body brings some closure to his family, but the conflict continues to claim lives and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
