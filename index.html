          <p>George Lucas is now directly overseeing the final stages of his Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles after years of delays and leadership changes. The museum recently parted ways with its director and eliminated several positions. Lucas has appointed himself head of "content direction" and named Jim Gianopulos as interim chief executive. The museum's mission is to explore how narrative art influences societies, but questions remain about its focus and purpose beyond showcasing Lucas's collections.</p>

          <p>The new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, has been detected in the U.S., with symptoms similar to previous strains, including respiratory issues and fatigue. While it appears more transmissible, data suggests it does not lead to more severe illness. The Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to seniors and those with underlying conditions, requiring new clinical trials for wider use. Experts warn that these restrictions could delay access for lower-risk groups and create confusion, potentially reducing vaccination rates.</p>
