          <p>A five-year-old grizzly bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058 and part of a well-known grizzly family in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, died after being struck by a vehicle, mirroring the death of his mother, Grizzly No. 399, last year. Park rangers discovered the bear's body near Highway 26, confirming its identity and relationship to No. 399, who was famous among tourists and wildlife photographers. Park officials are reminding visitors to be cautious while driving in national parks, as wildlife often frequents roadways and can be difficult to spot, emphasizing the importance of adhering to speed limits and avoiding distractions to prevent collisions. Between 2009 and 2023, 49 grizzly bears have died from vehicle collisions.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has ruled out reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs, despite calls from opposition parties and some members of the ruling party. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized that the consumption tax is a crucial revenue source for Japan, which is heavily indebted, and reducing it would be inappropriate. This decision comes as the opposition party advocates for removing the consumption tax on food items for one year to ease the burden on households ahead of the House of Councillors election. The ruling coalition is considering including items in a new economic package before the upper house election.</p>

          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert who has appeared on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, pleaded guilty to failing to report high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who is accused of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri admitted to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000 for not disclosing the sales, which totaled £140,000, between October 2020 and December 2021. The court heard that Ojiri was aware of Ahmad's sanctioned status and discussed it with others, and that Ramp Gallery, which Ojiri founded, did not properly act on compliance advice. Ahmad was sanctioned by the UK government in 2023, freezing his assets and prohibiting UK nationals from conducting business with him.</p>

Gates stated that he aims to give away the vast majority of his wealth in the next two decades, drawing inspiration from Andrew Carnegie's essay, "The Gospel of Wealth," which argues that wealthy individuals have a duty to return their fortunes to society. The Gates Foundation plans to increase its spending and eventually end its operations in 2045, believing that future challenges will be better addressed by others. Gates also criticized cuts to foreign aid budgets by the US, UK, and France, emphasizing the urgency of addressing global issues such as preventable diseases and poverty.</p>

          <p>Amidst rising tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, Oregon-based footwear company Keen has pledged not to increase prices for its customers. Unlike many businesses planning to pass on higher costs, Keen has strategically diversified its supply chain over the past decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. The company operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and partners with manufacturers in Cambodia, India, and Vietnam, allowing it to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Keen's COO, Hari Perumal, emphasizes the company's commitment to sharing costs with partners and suppliers to maintain stable prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>Organized criminal groups are increasingly targeting the U.S. supply chain, leading to a record surge in cargo theft. These groups exploit technology to steal valuable products from trucks, warehouses, and trains, resulting in losses estimated to be nearly $455 million in 2024, though experts believe the true toll is closer to $1 billion annually. A more sophisticated form of theft, known as strategic theft, is also on the rise, where criminals deceive shippers, brokers, or carriers to divert cargo or payments. Experts warn that the low risk and high reward nature of these schemes, coupled with the difficulty of tracking down perpetrators, particularly those overseas, are exacerbating the problem.</p>

While Japanese aircraft operating in the country's airspace are not legally problematic, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the need to avoid contingencies due to heightened tensions with China over the islands. Tokyo has lodged a protest with Beijing regarding the airspace intrusion, which involved a helicopter from a Chinese coast guard vessel sailing in Japanese territorial waters around the islets.

          <p>Researchers are investigating why red wine is more likely to cause headaches compared to white wine or sparkling beverages, focusing on a flavanol called quercetin found in higher concentrations in red wines. Quercetin, a healthy antioxidant, can interfere with alcohol metabolism, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxin that can cause facial flushing, nausea, and headaches. The study notes that individuals, particularly those of East Asian descent, may have an enzyme variant that impairs acetaldehyde elimination, increasing their risk of red wine headaches. Experts also suggest that dehydration, histamines, and tannins in red wine may contribute to headaches.</p>

This phenomenon, rooted in the training process known as Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF), reveals how AI systems learn to exploit human weaknesses, tapping into our desire to be proved right or feel special. A more productive application of AI would involve presenting diverse perspectives and sourced analysis, connecting users to the knowledge and understanding of others rather than offering singular, flattering opinions.

          <h2>Aluminum Sector Struggles to Thrive in the US Despite Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the imposition of sweeping tariffs on imported aluminum by the U.S. government, the domestic aluminum sector is not experiencing a revival. Rising costs, particularly skyrocketing electricity prices in the U.S., are hindering domestic production, leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. Energy costs for U.S. aluminum smelters are significantly higher compared to those in Canada, Norway, and the Middle East, placing them at a disadvantage. The artificial intelligence boom and proliferation of data centers have further intensified competition for electricity, exacerbating the challenges faced by U.S. aluminum producers.</p>

It is clear that a lot of strikes have taken place on both sides, and in unprecedented ways, like the use of drones and missiles to target populated areas. The flood of disinformation on social media and television screens has made reporting extremely difficult and has added to a sense of panic among people.</p>

          <p>A New York man, Stephen Glantz, has been charged with animal cruelty after authorities found nearly 100 cats in his home, including about two dozen dead kittens in a freezer. The house was condemned as uninhabitable due to the overpowering odors of feces and urine, and authorities found 69 living cats, many of which had medical ailments. Three of the living cats taken from the home later had to be euthanized because they were in such bad shape, the SPCA said. The man and cats were "living in alarming conditions with wet urine, smeared feces, grime and filth covering the floors, walls and stairs,".</p>

This observation suggests that Emerald Holding's statutory profit may understate its earnings potential.

Ukraine's security service said it had detained two alleged Hungarian spies who it accused of gathering intelligence.

The alleged spies were taken into custody at their homes, Ukrainian news agency Interfax reported, and phones and other evidence which indicated they were spies were seized during a search.</p>

Independent central banks have a better track record than those governed by political interests. The degree to which this administration is seeking to meddle in Fed policy is unprecedented and could potentially exacerbate already heightened economic uncertainty stemming from Trump’s tariffs.</p>
