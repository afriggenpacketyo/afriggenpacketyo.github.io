          <p>White House Budget Director Russell Vought downplayed the significance of Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Reserve, claiming he was unfamiliar with its specific contents. He stated that President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell stems from a desire for lower interest rates, not a broader plan to reform the central bank. Vought asserted the administration is focused on implementing the president's stated agenda, while also criticizing Powell for being too slow to adjust interest rates and for alleged fiscal mismanagement related to a building renovation. This context arises amid ongoing pressure from the Trump administration on the Fed's monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have resumed aid airdrops into Gaza following Israel's announcement of a daily "tactical pause" in fighting to allow humanitarian access. The World Health Organization warns that malnutrition in the Strip has reached "alarming levels" and is on a dangerous trajectory. Despite the pause, medics reported nine people were killed by Israeli fire near an aid convoy route, and an airstrike hit a residential area. The aid efforts, including land convoys, are struggling to meet the immense need, with the UN stating a third of Gaza's population goes days without eating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a trade deal, narrowly avoiding a looming deadline that threatened higher tariffs. President Trump announced the agreement, which establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a rate lower than the previously threatened 30%. As part of the deal, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments in the U.S. The agreement provides stability and predictability for the massive transatlantic trading relationship, though some European officials noted the new tariffs will still make trade more challenging.

          <p>Following the England women's football team's historic Euro 2025 final win against Spain, Downing Street has indicated it has no plans to announce a celebratory bank holiday. This decision aligns with the precedent set after the team's 2022 Euro victory and the men's 1966 World Cup win. While a victory parade is scheduled in London, the government appears to be weighing the potential economic cost of an extra public holiday, which has been estimated at over £1 billion. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had previously supported the idea, praised the "history makers" for their dramatic penalty shootout victory.</p>

          <p>During the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Indianapolis, driver Aric Almirola experienced a severe crash which he alleges was intentionally caused by competitor Austin Hill. With ten laps remaining, the two cars made contact, sending Almirola's vehicle hard into the wall. Almirola, who was uninjured, described the impact as one of the most violent of his career and called the move "uncalled for." Hill received a five-lap penalty for the incident but claimed over his radio that the contact was not intentional, a sentiment his team owner Richard Childress later defended.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogacar has officially won his fourth Tour de France, concluding the race with a significant lead over his rivals. The final stage in Paris featured a novel and controversial addition: three circuits around the steep, cobbled streets of Montmartre, a change from the traditional flat sprint on the Champs-Elysées. While Wout van Aert won the final stage, Pogacar celebrated his overall victory, which he attributed to building a comfortable lead during the tour's second week. Some riders, including second-place finisher Jonas Vingegaard, expressed concerns that the new, narrow climb added unnecessary stress to the final day.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent conservative figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters in middle America appear to be shrugging off the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews conducted in former Democratic strongholds that swung for Trump, like Johnstown, Pennsylvania, reveal a prevailing sentiment of loyalty and a belief that the issue is a distraction. These supporters remain focused on what they see as the administration's successes in areas like the economy and border security. This reaction highlights a complex and non-monolithic voter base, where some are highly animated by the Epstein issue while others dismiss it as another political attack.</p>

He emphasizes that Stokes' importance to the team is immense, but for the sake of England's future success, particularly in the upcoming Ashes series, Stokes himself must prioritize his long-term fitness.

          <h2>Analysis Explores Future of Late-Night Television Following Colbert Show Cancellation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 14:08:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" by CBS has sparked a debate about the future of late-night television. While some view it as a one-off financial decision by Paramount, others see it as a signal of the format's decline amid shifting viewer habits and rising production costs. The article notes that while late-night shows are losing money on traditional TV advertising, they generate significant online engagement and serve as valuable marketing hubs for media conglomerates. The fate of other shows, particularly ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose host's contract is up in 2026, will be a key indicator of the genre's viability.</p>

          <p>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has stated that the Trump administration is considering further funding clawbacks, known as rescissions, and has not ruled out pursuing them before the September government funding deadline. Speaking on CBS News, Vought confirmed his office is looking at a rescissions package for the Department of Education and is reviewing funds for the National Institutes of Health. This approach is viewed by critics as a contentious use of executive power to override congressional appropriations, setting the stage for potential political battles over government spending and the power of the purse.

          <p>According to an analysis by Ezra Klein, the controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein presents a unique political dilemma for Donald Trump. Having built his political brand by encouraging conspiracy theories about a secretive "deep state," Trump now presides over that very state and is being pressured by his own base to release all related files. His attempts to deflect and distract have only deepened suspicions, in part because of his own past relationship with Epstein. The article argues that Trump is now caught in a trap of his own making, as his control over the government's secrets contradicts his long-held narrative of being an outsider fighting a corrupt establishment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is damaging his democratic reputation by adopting a playbook similar to that of Donald Trump. The author contends that by signing a law that weakens Ukraine's independent anti-corruption agencies, especially as they investigated his allies, Zelensky is betraying the democratic principles he is supposedly fighting for. The piece suggests that the Trump administration's tolerance for global corruption has created a new global paradigm where leaders feel less pressure to maintain good governance, and even a figure like Zelensky is seizing the opportunity to protect his allies from scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to stop all U.S. funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed grave concerns about the Israeli-backed private organization, which has been criticized for its dangerous aid distribution methods that have led to hundreds of deaths. They urge the administration to resume support for the established UN-led aid mechanisms instead. This move comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning of mass starvation and condemning the GHF's operations as a "death trap."</p>
