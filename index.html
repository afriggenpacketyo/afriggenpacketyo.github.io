        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a powerful Category 5 storm, is currently positioned north of the Caribbean and is not expected to make landfall. Meteorologists are observing a rare possibility of it interacting with another developing system in the western Atlantic, a phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms might merge or orbit each other. The severity of this interaction depends on the storms' relative strengths, with weaker systems often being absorbed. Meanwhile, the second system, Tropical Depression Nine, is forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm and poses a threat of heavy rainfall to the southeastern U.S. coastline early next week, prompting states like South Carolina to declare a state of emergency.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that China's global initiatives could provide the necessary reform for the United Nations, which its General Assembly President describes as being at a “make-it-or-break-it moment.” The author critiques Western powers, particularly Germany and the United States, for their roles as arms suppliers to Israel amidst the conflict in Gaza, highlighting a perceived contradiction in their calls for peace. This perspective argues that the UN's current structure and the actions of some powerful members undermine its effectiveness, implying China offers a fresh approach to global governance. The article advocates for a shift in international dynamics to address pressing global challenges more effectively.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting him firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, with the caption "YOU'RE FIRED!" Trump has consistently criticized Powell for his interest rate policies, despite a recent rate cut, nicknaming him "Too Late Powell." This action comes amid ongoing legal debates about a president's authority to remove Fed officials, with a Supreme Court decision indicating such power is limited. Economists and investors fear that firing Powell could undermine the Fed's independence and potentially lead to higher long-term interest rates. The financial markets have shown little immediate reaction to these threats so far.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has intensified into a powerful Category 5 storm in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph, posing potential impacts to parts of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. While no immediate U.S. watches or warnings are active, swells generated by the storm are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast by Monday. This article notes Humberto is the eighth named storm of the season, and forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Depression Nine, which is expected to bring significant rainfall to Cuba and the Bahamas before approaching the U.S. Southeast coast.</p>

          <h2>Modular Homebuilder Fading West Offers Solution to U.S. Housing Affordability Crisis</h2>

          <p>Fading West, a modular homebuilder in Colorado, is offering a solution to America's housing affordability crisis by constructing homes in a factory setting, reducing costs by up to 20% and halving build times. The company, which builds single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment complexes, utilizes lean manufacturing principles and state-of-the-art facilities to complete a 10-ton house in about seven days. This approach was successfully demonstrated in Lahaina, Maui, where 82 modular homes were built for wildfire victims. The article highlights modular construction's benefits, including affordability, speed, waste reduction, and a stable workforce, suggesting it could be key to addressing the nationwide housing shortage.

          <p>California faces a severe housing shortage, widely acknowledged as the primary driver of its affordability crisis, yet estimates of the exact deficit vary wildly from 56,000 to 3.5 million units. This article explores the complexities behind these discrepancies, attributing them to differing methodologies, data limitations, and varying definitions of "housing needed," such as target vacancy rates and "pent-up demand." Despite the inconsistent numbers, experts agree the shortage is substantial, prompting lawmakers to pass bills aimed at increasing housing density.

          <p>President Trump has ordered the declassification of all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has fascinated the public for decades. While the widely accepted theory is that Earhart ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific, other unproven theories persist, including one suggesting she was captured by the Japanese on a spy mission. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged the declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart on Saipan. This article highlights the ongoing public interest in the aviator's fate and the administration's move to release any existing classified documents.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired 15 to 20 agents for "lack of judgment" after they were photographed kneeling at a 2020 racial justice protest following George Floyd's death. The FBI Agents Association condemned the dismissals, alleging violations of agents' rights and criticizing FBI Director Kash Patel for actions that "weakening the Bureau." This article notes the firings are part of the Trump administration's broader effort to purge perceived "left-wing" policies and officials from federal agencies. Critics argue kneeling was a de-escalation tactic, while right-wing commentators had previously criticized such actions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how President Donald Trump's open embrace of actions typically considered corrupt is altering public perception of political scandal. Unlike past presidents who concealed misconduct, Trump often publicizes his controversial decisions, such as directing the Justice Department to target political opponents or accepting a luxury plane from Qatar. Observers suggest this brazenness paradoxically earns him credit for authenticity and desensitizes the public, turning serious allegations into "background noise." The piece argues that Trump's ability to "flood the zone" with multiple controversies, coupled with a lack of institutional checks, has normalized behavior that would have ended careers previously.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume fermented fruit, ingesting alcohol equivalent to more than half a liter of beer for humans daily. Researchers observed chimps in Uganda and Ivory Coast consuming fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, totaling about 14 grams of alcohol per day. This finding, supported by a separate study on chimps in Guinea-Bissau, suggests that regular alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots in non-human great apes, challenging the idea that it's solely a human cultural phenomenon. The article highlights that alcohol consumption is more common in the natural world than previously thought.</p>
