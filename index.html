          <p>An Israeli official has indicated that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a "military solution" to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This shift in strategy comes from a growing belief within the Israeli government that Hamas is not genuinely interested in a diplomatic agreement. The news surfaces as thousands of protestors in Tel Aviv demand the government secure the hostages' release, with families expressing grave concerns for their loved ones' deteriorating health. Meanwhile, international concern grows over the severe hunger crisis in Gaza, with humanitarian organizations reporting critical conditions and deaths from malnutrition.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has stated that the new tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration are "pretty much set" and are unlikely to be negotiated down. The executive order establishes a baseline 10% tariff on imports from over 60 trading partners, with specific higher rates for countries like Canada. Greer explained that the President's goal is to rebalance trade and address the outflow of manufacturing jobs, even with key partners. The move has prompted economic uncertainty, with Bank of America economists predicting slower growth due to the trade conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a dramatic political maneuver, at least 51 Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by former President Trump, would heavily favor the GOP by creating five new Republican-leaning districts. The Democrats, who have traveled to Illinois, intend to stay away until the special legislative session ends, despite facing potential fines and threats of arrest from the Texas Attorney General. This is the third time in recent years that Texas Democrats have used this tactic to halt Republican legislative priorities.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind has demonstrated a new AI model named Genie 2, which can create playable, interactive 3D environments from a single static image or text prompt. CEO Demis Hassabis and his team showed how the technology can transform a photograph of a waterfall into a game-like world that an AI agent can explore. This world-building capability is seen as a crucial step toward creating sophisticated simulations for training AI agents and robots. By learning in these generated worlds, AI could acquire new skills much faster and more safely than by training exclusively in the physical world.</p>

          <p>The practice of egg freezing is rapidly increasing in popularity, particularly among younger women who view it as a way to manage their biological clocks and delay parenthood without pressure. This medical procedure allows women to store their eggs, retrieved at a younger age, for future use in IVF, effectively pausing their aging process. While proponents, including fertility doctors, hail it as revolutionary for female autonomy, critics raise concerns about the high costs, which average $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, and the fact that it is not a guarantee of a future pregnancy. This article also notes the growing trend of employers offering egg freezing as a benefit to attract and retain talent.</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 154 African migrants, reported to be Ethiopian nationals, has capsized off the coast of Yemen, resulting in a significant loss of life. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed that at least 68 people have died and 74 remain missing, with only 12 known survivors. Despite a decade-long civil war, Yemen remains a major transit route for migrants from the Horn of Africa seeking work in wealthier Gulf nations. The IOM describes this route as one of the world's most dangerous, with migrants facing extreme perils on their journey.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City and New Jersey area on Saturday night, causing brief shaking and confusion for some residents. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While the tremor was felt across the region, officials reported no injuries or significant structural damage. An analyst with the USGS noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not considered significant and is not expected to cause damage, comparing it to a larger 4.8 magnitude event that occurred in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Rescuers in Chile have confirmed the deaths of all five miners who were trapped following a tunnel collapse at the El Teniente copper mine, the world's largest underground mine. The bodies were recovered over the weekend after a desperate search operation. The incident, which brings the total death toll to six, was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor on Thursday. The state-owned mining company Codelco expressed its condolences to the families as authorities announced a criminal investigation into the cause of the collapse, which could be related to either mining activity or natural seismic shifts.</p>

Seismologists believe the events may be linked, suggesting the seismic waves from the massive quake could have "shaken loose" the magma system of the volcano, which was already primed to erupt.

          <p>A manhunt is in its third day for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of killing four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities say the suspect, who is considered armed and dangerous, shot the four victims "in cold blood" before fleeing. The victims, all local residents, were known to the suspect, who lived next door to the bar. The suspect's niece stated that her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years, while the community remains in shock over the violent act.</p>

With natural gas prices rising, solar has become the cheaper option for new power generation. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop installations, and growing constraints on the state's power grid.
