          <p>Investors in China are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with assets in this category soaring to over $50 billion. This trend is fueled by the country's persistent deflation and policies supporting the corporate sector, leading investors to seek low-risk, fixed-income assets. The appeal of bond ETFs lies in their lower costs, diversified holdings, and enhanced liquidity compared to direct debt investment. This surge reflects a broader strategy among investors to hedge against economic uncertainty and secure stable returns in a challenging market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air experienced a temporary, system-wide ground stop for approximately three hours due to an IT outage. The airline confirmed that the issue began around 8 p.m. Pacific time and was resolved by 11 p.m., allowing operations to resume. The carrier apologized for the disruption and warned passengers to anticipate residual flight impacts as it works to reposition aircraft and crews. The Federal Aviation Administration had issued advisories during the outage, though the specific cause of the IT failure was not immediately disclosed.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from about 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage domestic investment. The talks are part of the "Made for Germany" initiative, aimed at restoring confidence in the nation's economy after two years of recession. The government has already approved significant tax relief and a €500 billion infrastructure and climate fund. However, Berlin emphasizes that private sector capital is essential to supplement public spending and revive Germany's status as Europe's economic engine.</p>

          <p>Chinese firms are finalizing critical railway and port infrastructure in Guinea and Algeria, paving the way for iron ore shipments to China to begin this year. For years, logistical bottlenecks, particularly the lack of rail connections from mine sites to ports, have hindered exports from these African nations. In Guinea, the Simandou project, jointly developed with Rio Tinto, is expected to start shipping by November. Similarly, a new railway will connect Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara to Mediterranean ports, unlocking a significant new supply of iron ore.</p>

The diplomatic clash comes just days before a crucial summit between Chinese and EU leaders in Beijing.

          <p>A protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, Essex, escalated into what police described as "mindless thuggery," resulting in six arrests. Over 1,000 demonstrators gathered, with some throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of alleged sexual assaults in the town. Police implemented a dispersal order to prevent further disorder, warning that they would deal robustly with any criminal behavior. This was the latest in a series of tense demonstrations at the site.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison. His gang is blamed for transforming Ecuador into a hub of narco-violence and is linked to the assassination of a presidential candidate. The extradition represents a major step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime and follows a national referendum that approved the extradition of citizens.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing potential as a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Many women with PCOS report significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances after using these medications. The drugs are thought to work by improving insulin sensitivity, which can help regulate hormone levels. While research is ongoing and insurance coverage remains a hurdle, the results offer hope for managing a condition for which standard treatments have been limited for decades.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, died in a tragic accident after being pulled into an MRI machine by a 9kg (20 lbs) weight-training chain he was wearing around his neck. The incident occurred at a clinic in New York when he entered the room to help his wife, who was undergoing a scan. The machine's powerful magnetic field snatched the metal chain, pulling him into the device and causing a fatal medical episode. The accident highlights the extreme dangers posed by metallic objects near MRI machines, which exert incredibly strong magnetic forces.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast exists between the energy policies of China and the Trump administration, particularly concerning the green energy transition. As global electricity demand rises, driven by technologies like AI, China is forging ahead with massive investments in renewable energy to secure a technological lead. In contrast, the Trump administration is actively canceling tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them unreliable and a threat to the U.S. electric grid. This policy divergence positions the two global powers on opposing paths in the race for future energy dominance.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team changes its name back to the Redskins. In a social media post, Trump claimed there is significant demand for the old name, which was dropped in 2020 after criticism that it was a racist slur. It remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the project, which involves redeveloping a site on federal property that Congress has already given the city control over. He also called for the Cleveland Guardians to revert to their former name.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, making it the center of the virus's spread in North America. The number of infections is nearly three times higher than in the U.S., despite Canada's smaller population, with Alberta being the hardest-hit province. Health officials attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the spread of anti-vaccine misinformation. The outbreak, which began in late 2024, has primarily affected unvaccinated children and infants, highlighting a major public health challenge.</p>
