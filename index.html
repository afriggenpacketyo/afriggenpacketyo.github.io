          <p>Lithuania's Vilnius Airport experienced a temporary closure of its airspace in the early hours of Sunday, reportedly due to the sighting of hot air balloons. The airport confirmed the closure on its website, advising passengers to check for updates as flights were redirected to other locations like Riga and Kaunas. This incident follows a recent pattern of European airport disruptions caused by drone sightings, highlighting ongoing airspace security concerns. Authorities are investigating the exact nature of the airborne objects that prompted the shutdown.</p>

          <p>UCLA, under the interim playcalling of tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel, secured a stunning 42-37 victory over No. 7 Penn State, ending their four-game losing streak. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava led the Bruins with three rushing touchdowns and two passing touchdowns, demonstrating a revitalized offense that scored on its first five drives. This unexpected win, which saw UCLA nearly double its season-high point total, has sparked questions about whether it marks a turning point for the team or merely a temporary reprieve in a challenging season.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freshers' flu, a common ailment among new university students, is primarily an assortment of common cold viruses that spread rapidly in communal living and learning environments. Immunologists explain that students arriving from diverse locations introduce various respiratory viruses, while factors like late nights, poor diet, stress, and alcohol consumption weaken their immune systems. This combination creates a 'mixing pot' for infections, making it difficult for students to avoid illness. Despite being rarely serious, the symptoms can linger, prompting advice for students to prioritize rest and seek medical help for persistent issues.</p>

          <p>A Biden-appointed federal judge, Deborah Boardman, is facing conservative backlash for sentencing Nicholas Roske to eight years in prison for attempting to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This sentence is significantly lower than the 30 years sought by the Department of Justice, with the judge citing Roske's cooperation and other mitigating factors. Conservatives have widely condemned the decision, with some suggesting political motivations and questioning the judge's consideration of Roske's transgender identity. The DOJ plans to appeal the sentence, emphasizing the severe nature of the attack on the judicial system.</p>

          <p>Despite Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's repeated rejections, President Donald Trump's administration is deploying 300 National Guardsmen to Chicago, escalating tensions between federal and local leaders. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the order, which follows an incident where federal law enforcement shot an armed individual in a Chicago suburb after agents were allegedly rammed and boxed in by vehicles.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel is "on the verge of a very great achievement" and hopes to announce the return of all hostages from Gaza "in the coming days." His remarks come as indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to begin in Egypt, mediated by the U.S. and other nations. President Trump has also urged Hamas to act quickly on the peace proposal, warning that "all bets will be off" if there are delays. The proposed deal includes a phased release of hostages and Israeli troop redeployment, with Israel maintaining control of key areas in Gaza.</p>

This decision comes amidst other controversial immigration policies by the Trump administration, including accusations of reviving family separations and offering financial incentives for immigrant children to self-deport.

          <p>Premier League champions Liverpool have dramatically fallen from the top of the table after consecutive defeats marked by conceding late goals. Manager Arne Slot's side, which previously snatched wins with last-gasp strikes, now faces the bitter taste of their own medicine, losing to Chelsea and Crystal Palace in the final minutes. This marks Slot's first three-game losing streak, exposing flaws that have been evident since the season began despite an influx of new signings. The team's defensive balance has been questioned, and key players like Mohamed Salah are struggling with form, leading to a rocky period for the club.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has unveiled a new borders plan, pledging to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election. The proposals include banning asylum claims from those entering without permission and replacing the Immigration Tribunal with Home Office officials for appeals. The party plans to rebrand its enforcement unit as a "Removals Force" with doubled funding, aiming to remove 150,000 people annually. This ambitious target represents a five-fold increase from current removal figures and aligns with a broader strategy to exit the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

          <p>Iran executed six death-row inmates, alleging they carried out attacks in the oil-rich Khuzestan province on behalf of Israel, including killing police officers and orchestrating bombings. This brings the total number of executions in 2025 to over 1,000, a pace unseen in decades, amid a crackdown following the Iran-Israel war. Human rights groups, including Hengaw, identified the men as "Arab political prisoners" detained during 2019 protests, claiming they were subjected to severe torture and coerced confessions. Activists continue to raise concerns about Iran's reliance on closed-door trials and forced confessions in death penalty cases.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging Hamas to "move quickly" on the latest Gaza peace plan, warning of severe consequences if delays persist, as U.S. negotiators head to Cairo. Trump's pressure follows Hamas's partial acceptance of a 20-point plan, which includes an immediate hostage release within three days and a phased Israeli withdrawal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also expressed hope for the return of all hostages "in the coming days" and confirmed a significant reduction in Israeli military strikes in Gaza City. This diplomatic push seeks to end the two-year conflict, though obstacles remain regarding full disarmament and guarantees for sustained peace.</p>

Jones has issued a public apology, taking full responsibility for his remarks and reaching out to Gilbert directly. Both Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov.

Head coach Ruben Amorim, under pressure himself, praised Lammens' comfort during the game, acknowledging the need for continued adaptation. This performance offers a glimmer of hope for United's goalkeeping situation, though challenging fixtures against Liverpool and Brighton lie ahead.</p>

          <p>Turkey faces a complex energy balancing act, pressured by the U.S. and G7 nations to reduce oil and gas imports from Russia, despite its significant reliance on Russian supplies. Last year, 66% of Turkey's oil and 41% of its natural gas imports came from Russia, benefiting from lower prices due to EU sanctions. While resisting calls to cut ties, Turkey is quietly pursuing a diversification strategy, signing long-term LNG contracts with U.S. and Australian firms. This move aims to enhance energy security and improve relations with the U.S., but Turkey's dependence on Russia for other energy needs, like nuclear power plant construction, ensures the balancing act will continue.</p>

          <p>Jack Daniel’s distillery has ceased its 45-year tradition of providing free spent grain for cattle feed to local Tennessee farmers, a decision that could devastate the small town of Lynchburg. The company, owned by Brown-Forman, cites global environmental goals and sustainability standards as reasons for the shift, opting instead for a new anaerobic digester facility to generate renewable energy from waste. Farmers, many of whom have relied on the feed for generations, feel betrayed by the brand that built its image on local values. This move highlights a growing tension between corporate sustainability and local economic survival in rural America.</p>
