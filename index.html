        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has justified the decision to conceal a significant data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had worked with British forces. Shapps stated in an interview that the primary focus was on "saving lives," as those exposed were at risk of severe harm from the Taliban. The breach, which also included data on over 100 British officials, was kept secret by a court-ordered injunction until it was lifted in July. Shapps affirmed that erring on the side of caution was necessary given the potential for deadly retribution against collaborators.</p>

          <p>Top NBA draft pick Cooper Flagg made a notable debut in the Las Vegas Summer League, showcasing the skills that have made him one of the most anticipated prospects in years. Despite a self-described poor shooting performance in his first game, the 18-year-old phenom still displayed his defensive and playmaking abilities before scoring 31 points in his second appearance. Drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, Flagg is known for his intense work ethic and a focus on winning, drawing comparisons to NBA stars like Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum. Insiders praise his maturity and dedication, with some viewing him as the most complete teenage player since LeBron James.</p>

          <p>A husband-and-wife team of archaeologists from the University of Houston has discovered a 4th-century Mayan royal tomb at the Caracol site in Belize. The tomb is believed to belong to Te' K’ab Chaak, the earliest known ruler of the major Mayan city and the founder of its dynasty. Inside, the researchers found a wealth of priceless artifacts, including a jadeite death mask, numerous pottery vessels, and jewelry, all of which provide invaluable insight into the ancient culture. The discovery is the first confirmed royal tomb found at the site, marking a significant milestone in the decades-long study of Caracol.</p>

          <p>China has continued to reduce its holdings of U.S. government debt, with its portfolio dropping to $756.3 billion, the lowest point since March 2009. This marks the third straight month of declines, a trend occurring amidst ongoing trade tensions and concerns over the U.S. debt ceiling. According to data from the U.S. Treasury Department, China now ranks as the third-largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, behind Japan and the United Kingdom. Some analysts warn that the financial sector could emerge as a new area of conflict between the two global powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government has resumed deportation flights to Afghanistan, sending back 81 Afghan men with criminal records from Leipzig airport. This action, a key policy of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government, marks the first such collective repatriation since his administration took office. The move has drawn criticism due to the human rights situation in Afghanistan under the Taliban, with whom Berlin has held controversial talks despite not officially recognizing their government. The Interior Ministry stated the deportations fulfill a coalition agreement to remove criminals and individuals deemed a threat from the country.</p>

Abbott had previously apologized for a 2023 letter on the same topic but defended her original viewpoint in a recent interview, stating it is "silly" to claim all forms of racism are the same.

          <p>North Korea has unexpectedly banned foreign tourists from its new Wonsan-Kalma beach resort, a massive complex recently hailed by leader Kim Jong Un as a major success. The country's tourism authority announced the temporary ban without providing a reason, dimming prospects for a key project intended to attract foreign currency. The decision came shortly after a visit from Russia's foreign minister, who had promoted Russian travel to the site. Analysts speculate the ban may be a reaction to a Russian reporter's article that suggested tourists at the resort were mobilized by the state rather than being genuine visitors.</p>

Experts note the key distinction is intent; arbitrage exploits existing price differences, while manipulation involves creating artificial price movements. Jane Street disputes the findings, claiming its actions were standard index arbitrage, and plans to challenge the temporary trading ban. (not investment advice)</p>

The package now goes to President Trump for his signature, marking a significant, though contentious, fiscal policy victory for his administration.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced she will ask a court to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move follows a directive from President Donald Trump, who is facing growing pressure from his political base to provide more transparency on the matter. The decision comes after the Justice Department released a memo stating it found no evidence of an Epstein "client list" or blackmail, which angered many supporters. The change of course signals an attempt by the administration to quell the political firestorm surrounding the handling of the controversial case.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has stated that the U.S. Department of Justice is demanding a list of all non-citizen inmates currently held in county jails. Luna reported receiving "threatening letters" from the federal government, suggesting he could face federal charges for non-compliance. However, the Sheriff's Department does not collect data on inmates' immigration status, making it impossible to fulfill the request. Furthermore, California's sanctuary laws prohibit local law enforcement from sharing such information with federal immigration agents without a warrant, creating a standoff between local and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Martin Hemmings has publicly accused Raynor Winn, the best-selling author of "The Salt Path," of stealing approximately £64,000 from their business in the early 2000s. Ros Hemmings and her daughter claim that Winn, who worked as their bookkeeper, was responsible for the missing funds. This allegation follows an investigative report suggesting Winn's popular memoir gave a misleading account of why she and her husband lost their home. Winn has acknowledged making "mistakes" and stated the matter was settled privately on a "non-admissions basis," but the Hemmings family is speaking out to give a voice to their late patriarch.</p>

          <p>Syrian government forces have largely withdrawn from the southern province of Sweida after a U.S. and Turkey-mediated ceasefire halted days of deadly clashes with local Druze militias. The conflict, which killed nearly 600 people, had escalated significantly, drawing in Israeli airstrikes in defense of the Druze community. Under the new truce, Druze factions will manage internal security in the province. The fighting began with tit-for-tat attacks between Druze factions and local Sunni Bedouin tribes, who fought alongside government forces, threatening to destabilize Syria's post-war transition with sectarian violence.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that Donald Trump sent a lewd birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which allegedly included a sketch of a naked woman with a signature mimicking pubic hair. The card was reportedly part of a leather-bound album compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday. President Trump has vehemently denied the story, calling it "fake" and has threatened to sue the newspaper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. The report surfaces as Trump faces increasing pressure from his own supporters to release all government files related to the disgraced financier.</p>

          <p>HMP Pentonville in London has been put into special measures after a watchdog inspection revealed "frightening conditions" and systemic failures, including the illegal detention of inmates.

The report detailed a chaotic and dirty environment, with widespread cockroach infestations and most prisoners locked in their cells for over 22 hours a day. Inspectors also discovered "shockingly poor" oversight of prisoners under suicide watch, prompting emergency action.</p>

The ministry detailed methods used to bypass export restrictions, such as forging labels and transshipping cargo through third countries. This announcement comes after China imposed export controls on several rare earths in retaliation for U.S. tariffs, impacting global supply chains.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has approved a $9 billion rescission package that eliminates all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which supports NPR, PBS, and their member stations. The move, part of a broader cut to federal spending requested by the Trump administration, will remove $1.1 billion intended to fund public media over the next two years. NPR's CEO called the decision an "irreversible loss" that will dismantle local civic institutions, particularly harming stations in rural and underserved communities that rely heavily on federal support for operations and emergency broadcasting.</p>

          <p>Dozens of regions across Russia are experiencing widespread and frequent shutdowns of cellphone internet service, which officials attribute to security measures against Ukrainian drone attacks. The disruptions, which began in Moscow in May and have since spread nationwide, are causing significant problems for citizens, affecting electronic payments, ride-sharing apps, and navigation. While the Kremlin justifies the measures as necessary for public safety, digital rights groups warn that these unprecedented shutdowns curtail online freedom and create a precedent for authorities to abuse such restrictions, further stifling an already-controlled internet environment.</p>

          <p>A prominent index tracking China's progress toward a market-based economy has shown a decline, prompting calls from Chinese economists for more pro-market reforms. The National Economic Research Institute's report revealed that the country's overall marketization score fell in 2023, with the largest deterioration seen in the relationship between the government and the market. Researchers highlighted this as a "pretty significant change" and urged action to reverse the trend of increased government intervention. The findings come as economists express concern over economic imbalances and intense, state-influenced competition within industries. (not investment advice)</p>
