          <p>The national security trial of Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon and critic of Beijing, is entering its final stages in Hong Kong. Lai, who holds British citizenship, faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces, a charge his supporters argue is politically motivated to suppress dissent. The case has drawn international condemnation, with critics asserting it exemplifies the erosion of legal autonomy and free speech in the city under the national security law imposed by China. His son has been actively campaigning for his release, citing his father's deteriorating health.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated there is a "viable chance" for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer emphasized that any potential agreement must protect Ukraine's territorial integrity and be supported by robust security guarantees. He highlighted the readiness of a "coalition of the willing," comprised of mainly European nations, to provide military support and increase economic pressure on Russia if needed. The article also notes comments from U.S. Vice-President JD Vance, who stated Trump's mission is to restore peace in Europe.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to continue freezing or terminating billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. In a 2-to-1 decision, the court determined that the international aid groups who brought the lawsuit did not have the legal standing to challenge the President's action. This ruling overturns a lower court's injunction that had previously blocked the aid freeze. The funds in question include nearly $4 billion for global health initiatives and over $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs, which the administration has described as "wasteful."</p>

This same church, which regards cannabis as a sacrament, was previously shut down by the county in 2022 for functioning as an unlicensed dispensary, a case it continues to fight legally.</p>

          <p>New Mexico's governor has declared a state of emergency for the city of Española and surrounding areas in Rio Arriba County due to a significant increase in violent crime and drug trafficking. The order allocates $750,000 in emergency funds to bolster local law enforcement and public safety resources. Officials cited that police calls in the region have more than doubled over the past two years, and the county has the highest overdose death rate in the state, largely driven by fentanyl. This marks the second time this year the governor has declared a state of emergency over crime in the state.</p>

The article focuses on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps over six million Americans afford their utility bills. However, President Trump's 2026 budget proposal aims to eliminate the program, which the White House has called "failed" and "mired in fraud."

          <p>Researchers from Imperial College London are warning that UK cities face a growing threat from "firewaves," a term describing multiple urban wildfires ignited during extended periods of hot, dry weather. This warning follows recent heath and gorse fires in London and Edinburgh, which highlighted the vulnerability of urban green spaces. The research suggests that after ten consecutive dry days, vegetation becomes highly flammable, significantly increasing the risk of simultaneous fires that could overwhelm emergency services. Scientists propose adopting the "firewave" term to better signal extreme fire danger in urban areas as climate change continues to create more conducive conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that his administration will ask Congress for long-term extensions to maintain federal control over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. The president recently invoked a 1973 law to assume temporary control for up to 30 days, a move he justified as necessary to combat crime in the nation's capital. Any extension beyond this period requires a joint resolution from the House and Senate, which would need some Democratic support to pass. While Trump cited declining crime statistics, he asserted that federal oversight is essential for public safety and suggested he might declare a national emergency if Congress denies the extension.</p>

The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that drug treatment was associated with significant reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. Researchers believe this is because the medication helps reduce impulsivity and improve concentration, which are linked to these negative outcomes. The findings provide new evidence on the wider potential benefits of treatment, which could help patients make more informed decisions about starting medication.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs targeting China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asia to maintain a competitive edge. HD Hyundai, a major Korean conglomerate, plans to invest $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to hire 7,000 workers and build up to ten vessels annually. Analysts suggest this move allows Korean companies to overcome domestic constraints like high labor costs and union tensions. By shifting operations to countries with lower costs, they can strengthen their market position against Chinese competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government of Nova Scotia is facing criticism over its decision to ban all access to wooded areas, including for hiking and fishing, to mitigate extreme wildfire risk. The province, which has been described as a "tinder box" due to a lack of rain, has imposed a C$25,000 fine for violations. While Premier Tim Houston defended the restrictions as a necessary precaution, citing that human activity causes 97% of wildfires, some groups have called the ban "draconian" and an example of government overreach. The debate highlights the growing tension between public safety measures and individual freedoms in the face of escalating climate-related dangers.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the payment app Zelle, for allegedly failing to implement adequate anti-fraud safeguards. The lawsuit claims that these shortcomings allowed scammers to steal over $1 billion from consumers between 2017 and 2023. James alleges that EWS was aware from the outset that Zelle's design, including a quick registration process and lack of verification, made it highly susceptible to fraud but failed to act. The suit seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers and a court order mandating stronger anti-fraud measures.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost the UEFA Super Cup to Paris St-Germain in a penalty shootout after a dramatic late collapse, but the performance showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. For 85 minutes, Spurs led 2-0, effectively executing a pragmatic, counter-attacking game plan that neutralized the European champions, with both goals coming from set-pieces. While the team's inability to close out the game highlighted areas for improvement, the disciplined 3-5-2 formation and tactical flexibility were seen as a positive departure from the previous season's approach.

          <p>Nine years after Canada legalized Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), demand for the procedure has far surpassed initial predictions, creating complex ethical challenges for clinicians. This article delves into the country's approach, which is heavily guided by the principle of patient autonomy, meaning a patient does not have to exhaust all other treatment options to be eligible. This has led to difficult cases, such as patients with curable conditions requesting MAID, forcing doctors to navigate a law with broad individual discretion. The story examines what happens when a nation enshrines a right to die before fully reckoning with its logical and practical implications.</p>

The author, an independent journalist on social media, notes that while millions seek factual information online, they struggle to distinguish it from a flood of misinformation. The piece suggests that the current media landscape is in an "awkward adolescence," similar to the music industry after streaming emerged.

          <p>Brinker International's CEO, Kevin Hochman, reported that the Chili's restaurant chain has seen significant growth, with same-store sales increasing by nearly 24%. He attributed this success to a major boost in the company's marketing budget, which grew from $32 million to $137 million, and the standardization of its $10.99 value meal across the country. Hochman highlighted that giving social media influencers creative freedom has been effective in generating buzz, both paid and organic. This growth-focused strategy is helping the company combat inflationary pressures on labor and goods by increasing leverage on fixed costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Maron, who started his show in 2009, lamented that the proliferation of voices has lowered the bar for quality content, comparing much of it to "mediocre afternoon drive-time radio."

          <p>New research from UC Riverside has found a direct link between sinking land and depressed home prices in California's San Joaquin Valley. The study shows that decades of over-pumping groundwater for agriculture have caused land subsidence, which in turn has lowered home values by 2.4% to 5.4%, a loss of up to $16,165 per home. This has resulted in a cumulative loss of $1.87 billion in property value across eight counties between 2015 and 2021. The phenomenon is permanent but can be slowed, making the state's groundwater management laws crucial for mitigating further economic damage. (not investment advice)</p>

It also touches upon the lingering sentiment among some in modern Russia who still question the legitimacy of the transaction and view Alaska as historically Russian land.
