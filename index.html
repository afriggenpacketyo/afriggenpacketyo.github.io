          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 leading companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage private investment in the nation's economy. This "Made for Germany" initiative aims to restore confidence after two consecutive years of recession, with little economic improvement anticipated for 2025. The government has already committed to tax relief and a €500-billion infrastructure and climate fund but emphasizes that public funds alone are insufficient to stimulate the required growth. The talks are a critical effort to address Germany's ongoing economic sluggishness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese-led infrastructure projects in Guinea and Algeria are set to facilitate the export of iron ore to China starting this year. The completion of new railway lines and port facilities will resolve long-standing logistical issues that have previously hindered shipments from both African nations. In Guinea, the Simandou mine is expected to begin exporting by November, a project jointly developed by Rio Tinto and Chinese firms. Similarly, a new rail network will connect the Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria's Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports, opening up another significant source of iron ore for China's market.

          <p>Beijing has strongly condemned the European Union for sanctioning two Chinese banks, demanding an immediate reversal of the decision and vowing to protect its companies' interests. The sanctions were imposed just days before a crucial summit between Chinese and EU leaders, including President Xi Jinping and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. China's Ministry of Commerce expressed resolute opposition to the move, which Beijing had reportedly lobbied against behind the scenes. The diplomatic friction highlights rising tensions between the two economic powers over international policy and trade practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell has been named captain for the British and Irish Lions' upcoming match against a First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This marks Farrell's first start of the tour, where he will play at inside centre in a lineup that excludes players from the first-Test victory over Australia. The squad for this midweek game features nine Scottish players and includes all of the team's 'geography players' brought in as cover. The match provides an opportunity for several players to contend for a spot in the second Test, as coach Andy Farrell rests his primary team.</p>

          <p>The family of legendary England batter Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide last year at 55, is organizing 'A Day for Thorpey' to celebrate his life and raise mental health awareness. The event will take place on what would have been his 56th birthday during the fifth England-India Test at The Oval, his former home ground. In partnership with the charity Mind, specially designed headbands will be sold to fund 'Thorpey's Bat and Chat' sessions, an initiative supporting mental health through cricket. His family hopes to reduce the stigma around suicide and encourage people to seek help early.</p>

Following the withdrawal, humanitarian aid convoys have begun entering the city to address shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. The conflict had threatened Syria's fragile post-war stability, drawing in government forces and prompting airstrikes from Israel, creating a complex and volatile regional crisis.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, has died after being pulled into an active MRI machine by a 9kg metal weight-training chain he was wearing around his neck. The incident occurred at a clinic in New York when his wife, who was undergoing a knee scan, called out for his assistance. The machine's powerful magnetic force violently pulled him into the device, causing a fatal medical episode. His wife witnessed the event, stating he went limp in her arms. Such accidents are rare but highlight the extreme dangers of bringing metallic objects near MRI machines.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, a significant divergence has emerged between the U.S. and China regarding energy and climate policy. While global demand for clean energy is rising, driven partly by the needs of AI and other new technologies, China has aggressively pursued renewable energy goals and increased related investments. In contrast, the Trump administration is focused on canceling tax credits for wind and solar, labeling them as unreliable. This differing approach positions China to surge ahead in the green energy race, a key component of the broader technological rivalry between the two global powers. (not investment advice)</p>

While she has expressed support for left-leaning figures like Bernie Sanders, she also revealed she made a promise to UFC President Dana White not to speak negatively about Donald Trump. This was due to Trump's early support for the UFC when the organization struggled to find venues. Rousey emphasized that while she honored her promise to White, she believes strongly in the individual's right to vote privately and encourages civic participation regardless of political affiliation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the Redskins. In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed there is a large demand for the name change and that he might impose a restriction on the stadium project if the team does not comply. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It remains unclear what authority Trump could use to intervene in the project.</p>

The incident occurred near Minot Air Force Base, and the pilot expressed surprise at the lack of a warning from air traffic control.

          <p>Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 infections in 2025, primarily affecting children. This figure makes Canada the center of the outbreak in North America, with a per capita spread rate higher than in the U.S. The provinces of Ontario and Alberta are the hardest hit, with low vaccination rates in some communities identified as a key factor. Health officials attribute the spread to declining immunization rates and the rise of anti-vaccine misinformation following the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring a significant public health challenge.</p>
