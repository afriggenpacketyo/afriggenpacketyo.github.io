          <p>Following a significant Russian aerial attack on Ukraine, former U.S. President Donald Trump expressed his disapproval of Vladimir Putin's actions, describing them as "absolutely crazy." Trump, who has historically maintained a positive relationship with Putin, noted his dismay at the ongoing violence against Ukrainian cities and civilians. He also suggested the possibility of imposing additional sanctions on Russia in response to the escalating conflict. However, Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his public statements, stating they were "doing his country no favors."</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a fourth official, Ri Hyong Son, in connection with the failed launch of a new navy warship. The incident, which involved damage to the 5,000-ton destroyer, has been deemed a "criminal act" by leader Kim Jong Un due to carelessness and lack of scientific rigor. Ri Hyong Son, a vice department director of the Munitions Industry Department of the Party Central Committee, is the most senior official detained thus far. Repair work on the warship is reportedly underway, though observers suggest it may take longer than the 10 days initially projected by North Korean state media.</p>

          <p>As South Korea prepares for its upcoming presidential election, many women feel their concerns are being overlooked by leading candidates. Despite young women's significant role in protesting against the previous president, the current political climate sees candidates hesitant to address gender-based discrimination for fear of alienating male voters. South Korean women face significant challenges, including a substantial wage gap and underrepresentation in leadership roles. Some women express disillusionment, believing that neither leading candidate is adequately addressing their needs and concerns regarding equality and safety.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles in an effort to reduce rising prices, with the goal of reaching approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This action addresses public criticism regarding the government's perceived ineffectiveness in managing rice prices, which have significantly increased amidst broader inflationary pressures. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system to exert greater control over pricing. The move follows the appointment of a new farm minister after his predecessor resigned due to a gaffe about rice purchases.</p>

He argues that prioritizing employment and debt control alongside a 4% growth rate would be more beneficial.

          <p>Spain's Foreign Minister, Jose Manuel Albares, has advocated for an arms embargo against Israel to address the ongoing conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as "inhumane." Speaking at a meeting of the Madrid Group, Albares also proposed targeted sanctions against individuals obstructing a two-state solution. Spain has been a vocal critic of Israel and officially recognized Palestine as a state. The meeting in Madrid involved representatives from various European and Arab nations, aiming to increase international pressure on Israel.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine suggests that Beijing could subdue Taiwan by targeting critical infrastructure, leading to a "system collapse" that undermines resistance. The article identifies 30 to 40 key targets, including liquefied natural gas facilities, whose disruption could paralyze essential services like electricity and water. This "urban collapse warfare" strategy aims to achieve maximum impact with minimal military cost, potentially enabling a "win without fighting." Taiwan's reliance on imported resources and vulnerability to natural disasters make it susceptible to this approach.</p>
