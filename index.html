          <p>President Trump is disputing an early intelligence report suggesting that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set Tehran's nuclear program back by months, asserting that the damage is more extensive than initially assessed. Trump maintains that the facilities were "obliterated," citing additional intelligence and assessments from individuals who have visited the site. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump's claims, dismissing the initial report as preliminary and speculative. The conflicting accounts have sparked debate and criticism, with some questioning the administration's transparency and accuracy regarding the strikes' impact.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s growing influence over federal vaccine policy is raising concerns within the medical community.

          <p>Bumble's shares increased after the dating app company announced plans to reduce its workforce by 30%, affecting approximately 240 roles. The layoffs are expected to result in $13 million to $18 million in charges for the company during the third and fourth quarters of the year. Bumble anticipates that the reductions will lead to annual savings of $40 million, which will be reinvested into new product and technology development. Despite the recent surge, Bumble's market value has significantly declined since its public market debut in 2021. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
