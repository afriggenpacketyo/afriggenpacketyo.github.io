          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a comprehensive bill aimed at enacting President Trump's agenda, which includes significant tax cuts, increased defense spending, and stricter immigration enforcement. The bill proposes substantial savings for the wealthy by extending the 2017 tax cuts, while simultaneously cutting funding for health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. However, the plan faces internal challenges, particularly regarding the state and local tax deduction cap and Medicaid reforms. Republicans are using a budget reconciliation process to bypass Democratic opposition, but divisions within the party could jeopardize the bill's passage, especially concerning Medicaid cuts which are considered a 'nonstarter' by some Republicans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene era, approximately 50,000 to 13,000 years ago. This migration occurred when lower sea levels created a land bridge connecting the two continents. The research indicates genetic exchanges between horse populations in both directions, with fossils of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China showing mixed ancestry from Eurasian and American populations. These Dalianensis horses, which lived around 17,000 years ago, were slightly larger than modern wild horses, highlighting the dynamic movement and genetic mixing of species across continents during this period.</p>

          <p>A progressive district attorney in Colorado has faced criticism for offering a lenient plea deal to a teenage illegal immigrant who caused a high-speed crash that killed a 24-year-old woman. The teen, who was driving at 90 mph in a residential area, received two years of probation and 100 hours of community service. The victim's father expressed outrage, stating that the prosecutor's office initially indicated there would be no plea offer. The prosecutor defended the deal, emphasizing the dangers of speeding and acknowledging the tragic loss, while the victim's attorney called the deal 'abhorrent'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court is considering the scope of presidential power, particularly regarding birthright citizenship, in light of Donald Trump's attempt to limit it via executive order. The court is examining whether to narrow the scope of 'nationwide injunctions' issued by federal judges, which the Justice Department argues unfairly restricts the president's authority. The case stems from Trump's executive order seeking to deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents, a plan widely seen as contradicting the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, strategically selecting federal jurisdictions to find judges sympathetic to their political views. Conservatives often file lawsuits against the Biden administration in small Texas courts with single judges appointed by Republicans, ensuring favorable initial rulings. Similarly, liberals have been filing cases against the Trump administration in Massachusetts, seeking judges in the 1st Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to issue nationwide injunctions, potentially limiting the impact of venue shopping and altering the landscape of legal challenges to presidential policies.</p>

          <p>Walmart has cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the company may still need to raise prices on certain items due to ongoing trade pressures. The retailer's CEO, Doug McMillon, stated that tariffs are creating cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys. While Walmart aims to absorb some of these costs, the potential for significant financial impact remains, especially if tariff levels increase again.

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting access to only older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products,' necessitating additional clinical evaluation. This includes COVID shots and possibly even the seasonal flu vaccine. Some experts fear these new limits are the first steps in undermining the use of all vaccines by raising doubts about their safety, while others argue that annual booster shots may offer only marginal benefits to younger, healthy individuals.</p>

          <p>An audit in Maryland has uncovered that medical examiners miscategorized dozens of deaths that occurred in police custody over the past two decades, with at least 36 deaths incorrectly classified as accidental or natural causes instead of homicides. The report indicated evidence of racism and pro-police bias, finding that deaths of Black individuals or those restrained by police were less likely to be labeled as homicides. The audit was prompted by George Floyd's killing and raised concerns about the testimony of Dr. David R. Fowler in similar cases. The governor has ordered a review to determine if criminal charges are warranted, and experts suggest other states should conduct similar audits.</p>

While Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief, the sudden and broad nature of the announcement has created uncertainty and prompted internal discussions within the Treasury Department to determine implementation strategies. Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.</p>

Despite the Department of Homeland Security's claim that FEMA is fully activated, the review cites 'culture issues,' staffing shortages, and coordination challenges with other federal agencies.

          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. The GDP data revealed that exports fell by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, significantly impacting the overall economic performance. Uncertainties stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies have particularly affected Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had previously warned that the country's economy is likely to moderate due to global trade policies, potentially impacting business investments and household consumption. Despite these concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate to achieve its inflation target.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian envoys are set to commence in Istanbul, marking the first direct meeting between the two countries in three years, with Turkish representatives present. These talks will also include trilateral meetings between the United States, Ukraine, and Turkey, as well as between Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey. The US delegation, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has tempered expectations for the discussions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will not attend the talks due to Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to participate, criticizing Putin's decision to send a 'decorative' lineup instead of attending himself.</p>

          <p>Small businesses in the U.S. are struggling with financial whiplash as President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods fluctuate. Business owners like Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances, are facing significant challenges in managing costs and pricing. The initial imposition of a 145% tariff led to substantial duty tax bills, followed by a reduction to 30%, forcing businesses to adapt quickly. While the lower tariff offers some relief, it still adds to costs, and businesses are uncertain about future trade policies, making it difficult to plan and maintain profitability.</p>

          <p>As President Trump asserts unprecedented executive powers, the Supreme Court is considering whether to limit the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against unconstitutional government actions. The court heard oral arguments regarding the president's order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which contradicts the 14th Amendment. The justices appear ideologically divided, with the outcome potentially hinging on Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Brett M. Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. If nationwide injunctions are eliminated, challenges to government policies would need to be brought separately in each federal district, creating inconsistent laws across the country.</p>
