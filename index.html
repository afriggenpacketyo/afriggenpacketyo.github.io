          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction on its fifth terminal, set to be operational by the mid-2030s, aiming to accommodate the expected surge in air travel demand in Asia. The new terminal will almost double the airport's existing size, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers annually, up from the current 90 million. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong emphasized that this expansion will enhance connectivity, linking the nation to 200 cities, compared to the current 170. The aviation ecosystem contributes 5% to Singapore's GDP, driving industries such as tourism, aerospace, and logistics, making this expansion a critical investment in the country's future.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a tax bill that would significantly cut climate-related funding, reduce regulations, and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump's tax cuts. The proposed cuts target key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, affecting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Environmental groups and renewable energy companies are lobbying against the changes, arguing that they would harm new industries and local economies, particularly in Republican districts. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would impact local economies in Republican districts.</p>

Maureen Hartnett stated that while she found broken glass, scratches, and a dent on Read's SUV, as well as blood and debris from O'Keefe's clothes, the substance collected in the cups was never identified as blood due to lack of testing. The defense could request testing of these swabs if they still exist, potentially impacting the case.
