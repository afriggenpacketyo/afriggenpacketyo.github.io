        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have established a framework deal on tariffs, narrowly avoiding a larger trade war. The agreement is being presented as a significant victory for the Trump administration, as it sets a 15% tariff on many EU goods, though this is lower than the 30% initially threatened. In return, the EU will reportedly increase purchases of US energy and military equipment, while key sectors like steel and aluminum will continue to face high 50% tariffs. The deal brings some stability but leaves tariffs higher than their historical levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of semiconductors. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, is for Tesla's next-generation AI chips, with Musk highlighting its immense strategic importance. He stated that Samsung's new Texas facility will be dedicated to producing the AI6 chip and that Tesla will personally assist in optimizing manufacturing efficiency. The announcement caused Samsung's shares to rise over 6% in trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, a move that could lead to strike action later in the year. The union has criticized the offer as inadequate compared to pay rises for other public sector workers. The RCN is now calling for new negotiations with the government over the summer to avoid a formal strike ballot in the autumn. This development follows the GMB union, which represents other health workers, also rejecting the same pay deal.</p>
