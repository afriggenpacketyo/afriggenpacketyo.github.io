          <p>The exchange of aerial attacks between Israel and Iran has continued into its sixth day, escalating tensions in the region following Israel's surprise operation which targeted Iran's nuclear program and killed nuclear scientists and military leaders. The United States has stated they were not involved in the initial Israeli strike, though President Trump indicated potential future involvement. The recent attacks have heightened concerns about regional stability and potential broader conflict, with both sides issuing strong statements and warnings, raising the stakes for international diplomacy and security in the Middle East. The ongoing conflict underscores the complex geopolitical dynamics and the potential for further escalation in the region, as well as the United States' potential role in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick is rapidly intensifying in the Eastern Pacific, projected to reach major hurricane status before impacting southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane warnings and watches for coastal areas, anticipating destructive winds, heavy rainfall, and dangerous storm surge. Erick is expected to bring 8 to 20 inches of rain, leading to life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, which could cause catastrophic damage, with preparations to protect life and property needing to be rushed to completion. This is especially concerning as Acapulco is still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Otis in 2023, which underscores the increasing vulnerability of coastal communities to extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Princess of Wales has withdrawn from her planned attendance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life following her cancer diagnosis last year. Royal sources indicate she is trying to find the right balance as she fully returns to public engagements, expressing disappointment in missing the event. Other members of the royal family, including King Charles, Queen Camilla, and Prince William, attended the event, with Prince William handing out race prizes, while Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, was also present. The Princess was last seen at the Order of the Garter service, and her recent public appearances have been increasing.</p>

          <p>According to a new Zillow report, selecting the right interior paint colors can increase a home's sale price by nearly $2,600. Olive green is the most desirable kitchen color, potentially adding up to $1,600 in value, while classic navy walls in the bedroom can increase the price by an estimated $1,815. Dark gray living rooms are also favored by buyers, while bright, playful colors may deter them, so sellers should consider neutral and sophisticated tones to maximize buyer interest. The report emphasizes the importance of aesthetic considerations in attracting buyers and increasing a home's market value.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced the arrest of Roberto Carlos Munoz, an illegal migrant from Guatemala and a convicted child sex offender, after he allegedly dragged an ICE officer 50 yards with his car while attempting to evade arrest in Bloomington, Minnesota. The ICE officer was hospitalized but is expected to recover fully, and Munoz has a criminal history dating back to 2010, including convictions for domestic assault and sex crimes against an underage teenager.

Her defense argued she was framed for O'Keefe's death, while prosecutors claimed she intentionally hit him with her car, the case drawing significant attention and sparking debates over the investigation's integrity.

          <p>Republican lawmakers are proposing significant changes to the federal student loan system, including eliminating several repayment plans and rolling back relief options for unemployed or financially challenged borrowers. These proposals, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aim to save an estimated $300 billion from the federal budget by shifting the burden of student debt from taxpayers. Consumer advocates argue that these changes will make it harder for people to get out of debt and deepen the existing lending crisis.

Yellow heat-health alerts are in place for most of England, indicating increased risks for vulnerable individuals, and temperatures are expected to rise further, with the possibility of a "tropical night" where temperatures do not drop below 20C. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where parts of France and Spain could see temperatures close to 40C.

Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the region if the U.S. joins Israel's war efforts, and an Iranian official warned that any U.S. intervention would risk "all-out war". The steady exchange of fire has resulted in casualties on both sides, and the conflict has sparked an exodus from Iran's capital, with Israel advising its citizens to remain close to bomb shelters.</p>

The jury found Read guilty on only one charge: operating a vehicle under the influence, with the judge sentencing her to one year of probation.
