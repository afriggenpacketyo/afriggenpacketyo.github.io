          <p>The United States and the European Union have established a framework for a major trade deal, though specific details remain to be finalized. An initial analysis suggests the EU has conceded more, potentially facing a minor GDP reduction, while the US stands to gain from new import taxes. The agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods, is seen as a political victory for President Trump but could raise costs for American consumers. Sectors like German carmakers and EU pharmaceuticals may face challenges, whereas US automakers and energy producers could benefit from the new terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A twin-engine Beechcraft airplane crashed off the coast of Point Pinos in Monterey County, resulting in the deaths of all three individuals on board. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to the incident late Saturday night after the plane, which had departed from San Carlos airport, went down near Asilomar State Beach. Search and rescue crews recovered the victims, who were identified as Steve Eugene Clatterbuck, James Vincent, and Jamie Lee Tabscott. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fatal crash.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is reportedly stabilizing under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago. The company's aircraft production and deliveries have increased, and analysts anticipate it will post its first annual profit since 2018 next year, boosting investor confidence. Despite these positive signs, including improved relationships with major airline customers, Boeing still faces significant challenges. Ongoing issues include FAA production caps on the 737 Max, certification delays for new models, and persistent problems within its defense unit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in his capacity as the head of the ASEAN regional bloc. The conflict, which flared after a landmine explosion, had escalated with both nations blaming each other and recalling their ambassadors. The ceasefire is seen as a crucial first step toward de-escalation and restoring peaceful relations between the two Southeast Asian neighbors.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores why 94-year-old media mogul Rupert Murdoch is confronting President Trump, a figure his Fox News channel has often supported. The Wall Street Journal, owned by Murdoch, published a story about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to a $10 billion lawsuit from the president. While other media outlets have reportedly yielded to pressure from the Trump administration, Murdoch appears determined to defend his newspaper's reporting. The author speculates on Murdoch's motives, suggesting they could range from business strategy to a personal vendetta or a final, complex act to protect press freedom.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the challenge of making "hard choices," such as choosing between a high-paying corporate job and a lower-paying but morally fulfilling nonprofit career. Drawing on the work of philosopher Ruth Chang, the article argues that such choices are difficult not because one option is secretly better, but because the alternatives are "on a par." Instead of searching for an objectively correct answer, individuals must use their own agency to create reasons for their choice, thereby defining who they want to become. This act of choosing is presented as a fundamental and powerful aspect of human freedom.</p>

This deal aims to bring stability to the conflict-ridden region while granting American companies access to minerals vital for green energy and technology.

It traces NASA's decline from a symbol of national competence during the Apollo era to its current dependency on SpaceX for launching nearly all U.S. rockets. While acknowledging SpaceX's engineering success, the piece contends that this reliance gives one billionaire immense, unchecked power over a critical national asset. The author warns that Musk's personal obsession with colonizing Mars is supplanting NASA's broader, humanistic scientific mission to explore the universe "for all mankind."</p>

          <p>As GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic become increasingly widespread for weight loss and other potential health benefits, a major question remains about their long-term effects on the brain's desire and reward pathways. These medications work by mimicking a gut hormone that, in drug form, can cross into the brain and suppress cravings for food, alcohol, and even addictive substances. While this has immense therapeutic potential, experts express caution about the unknown consequences of modulating human desire over decades. The central mystery is whether these drugs can selectively curb harmful compulsions without diminishing positive drives.</p>

          <p>A report from Renmin University indicates that the international use of China's yuan grew by about 11% in 2024, strengthening its position in the global monetary system. While the U.S. dollar still dominates, its influence slightly decreased, whereas the yuan now ranks ahead of the British pound and Japanese yen. The report frames the promotion of the yuan's internationalization as a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global financial order. However, it also identifies a new challenge: the rise of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, which could reinforce the dollar's standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity forecasts a significant reconfiguration of global trade following the new U.S.-E.U. trade deal. The model predicts that the 15% tariff on European goods will cause global exports to the U.S. to drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to recent averages. This shift is expected to heavily impact countries like China, Canada, and Mexico, as other nations rewire their trade relationships away from the U.S. The analysis suggests that while U.S. exports may see a modest increase, the overall effect will be a dramatic reduction in imported goods.

The filings include accounts of children being denied medication, held in dirty clothes for days, and kept in "prison-like" settings for weeks, far exceeding the 72-hour policy limit. This comes as the Trump administration is asking a federal judge to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a long-standing consent decree that mandates basic standards of care for children in government custody.

          <p>Psychologists are recognizing that not all children respond to ultra-processed foods in the same way, with some having a naturally stronger "food reward drive." These children feel more motivated to eat and struggle to feel full, making them vulnerable in an environment with hyper-palatable foods. Experts suggest that standard advice may not work for these kids and recommend specific strategies for parents. Instead of keeping such foods at home and trying to regulate intake, they advise keeping the home environment largely free of ultra-processed items while allowing them in moderation outside the home.</p>
