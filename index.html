          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that both Thailand and Cambodia are seeking an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly border clashes. During a visit to Scotland, Trump announced on social media that he had spoken with leaders from both nations, suggesting peace was a "natural" outcome. The conflict, rooted in a long-standing territorial dispute over the Preah Vihear temple, has recently intensified, resulting in at least 33 deaths and displacing over 130,000 people. While officials from the involved countries have not confirmed Trump's direct role, they have expressed willingness to engage in dialogue to de-escalate the violence.</p>

          <p>An extreme heatwave is sweeping across the U.S. Midwest and Southeast, prompting widespread heat advisories and warnings for over 136 million people. A persistent "heat dome" is trapping hot air, causing temperatures to soar 10 to 15 degrees above average, with heat indexes expected to reach as high as 115°F in some areas. The National Weather Service is urging residents to take precautions, such as staying hydrated and limiting outdoor activities, to prevent heat-related illnesses. Major cities like Raleigh, Charlotte, and Atlanta are facing an extreme heat risk with minimal overnight relief expected for several days.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 42 Palestinians were killed in recent Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, including individuals waiting for humanitarian aid near the Zikim crossing. The violence continues as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled, with both the U.S. and Israeli delegations being recalled. The humanitarian situation is dire, with the UN warning of famine and reports of rising deaths from malnutrition, tragically highlighted by the death of a five-month-old infant. Despite international pressure and some aid entering, the volume is insufficient to address the catastrophic crisis affecting the population.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha revealed that the success and influence of England's Lionesses in women's soccer made this the right time to revisit the characters. The 2002 movie, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is celebrated for inspiring a generation of female athletes. Chadha is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast for the new project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, according to a presentation reviewed by ABC News. This finding challenges claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify limiting aid through traditional channels and supporting the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The report, compiled before USAID ceased independent operations, noted that in most cases of aid loss, the perpetrator could not be identified. The State Department and the Israeli Defense Forces have strongly pushed back against the report's conclusions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have created a new wearable sensor designed to continuously monitor a person's hydration levels in real time. The non-invasive device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the skin to measure tissue hydration, and transmits the data to a smartphone. This technology aims to provide a simple and effective way for individuals, especially athletes or those with certain medical conditions, to avoid the dangers of dehydration. The developers believe the sensor offers a practical alternative to traditional methods like blood or urine tests and could be crucial in preventing serious health issues like heatstroke.</p>

After an early setback losing two wickets for no runs, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) frustrated the English bowlers. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first Test century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

This incident underscores the dangers Palestinians face when trying to access aid through the GHF system, which the UN says has led to over 1,000 deaths since its implementation.

          <p>BBC's Jeremy Bowen argues that airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, while a visible gesture, is a crude and desperate measure that will not solve the widespread hunger crisis. Drawing on his experience covering past conflicts, he explains that airdrops are inefficient, delivering far less than truck convoys, and can be dangerous, with pallets sometimes landing in hazardous areas or on shelters. He asserts that the only effective solution is a sustained, unrestricted land-based aid operation, which requires a ceasefire and political will. The analysis concludes that airdrops are more of a public relations move than a practical solution to the man-made starvation.</p>

Factors such as genetics, overall health, and pregnancy can influence how the body reacts to caffeine.

          <p>Venezuelan men who were deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison reportedly endured horrific abuse and "state-sanctioned torture," according to their lawyers. After being freed in a prisoner swap, the men are sharing testimonies of beatings, humiliation, and inhumane conditions. One man, José Manuel Ramos Bastidas, was flagged as a potential gang member by the U.S. based on unsubstantiated reports and sent to the prison despite having no criminal convictions. Human rights groups and lawyers are condemning the U.S. government's decision to send the men to a facility known for its brutal conditions.</p>

          <p>The "department of government efficiency" (Doge), a body established under the Trump administration, is reportedly using an AI tool to identify and create a "delete list" of federal regulations. According to internal documents, the "Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool" is analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of eliminating half of them within a year of a potential second inauguration. The initiative, part of a promise for the "most aggressive regulatory reduction" in history, has reportedly been used by agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The White House has confirmed it is exploring all options to enhance government efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

Kotsev, a member of the opposition PP party, was accused of corruption by an anti-corruption commission, but critics claim the charges are politically motivated by the ruling conservative GERB party. The incident has highlighted long-standing issues with Bulgaria's justice system, with protesters and political scientists warning of a trend towards authoritarianism.

He points to a decline in viewing time per subscriber and the growing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. While Netflix's earnings remain strong, Rogers argues that engagement is the key driver of its business model. He also suggests that while AI will help Netflix, it will also empower amateur creators on YouTube, blurring the line between professional and user-generated content and further challenging Netflix's dominance.

          <p>In a formal request to the estate of Jeffrey Epstein, House Democrats are seeking a complete, unredacted copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for the disgraced financier in 2003. The request follows reports that the book contains a "bawdy" letter signed by former President Donald Trump, a claim he has vehemently denied and sued over. The lawmakers argue the document is relevant to congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation. This move intensifies the political pressure on the Trump administration to provide more transparency regarding the Epstein case.</p>

Analysts note that while the long-term vision for AI and robotics is compelling, the current profit and loss dynamics need to improve.

          <p>An analysis from "Washington Week With The Atlantic" explores why the Jeffrey Epstein controversy continues to plague the Trump administration, arguing it strikes at the core of his populist appeal. Panelists suggested that the case involves powerful people acting in secret, a narrative Trump often uses against his opponents, but now he appears to be defending those same elites. This dynamic makes it difficult for him to shake the issue, as it resonates negatively with his base. The discussion highlights how a once-fringe conspiracy theory has evolved into a significant and spiraling political crisis for the White House.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic challenges the notion that reading is a strictly indoor pursuit, advocating for the simple pleasures of reading a book outside. Author Bekah Waalkes argues that reading outdoors should be considered a form of play and a practice in sustained attention that can sharpen one's perception of the surrounding natural world. The piece suggests that combining the act of reading with being in nature, whether in a park or a beer garden, enhances both experiences. It frames the activity not as an escape from the world, but as a deeper engagement with it.</p>

          <p>A U.S. research team has discovered the presence of PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in a significant portion of reusable period products, including menstrual cups and underwear. These toxic substances, which do not break down in the environment, have been linked to serious health issues like cancer and fertility problems. The study found that while some products were PFAS-free, nearly a third of those tested contained the chemicals, likely added during the manufacturing process. Researchers are urging consumer awareness and pressure on companies to eliminate these unnecessary and harmful chemicals from their products.</p>

          <p>In an effort to manage political fallout, former President Donald Trump has directed the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. However, legal experts and victim advocates are skeptical that these transcripts will reveal the full scope of Epstein's crimes or the involvement of others. They argue that the most crucial information likely resides in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal Justice Department memos. While seen as a potential first step, critics suggest that releasing only the grand jury files is a limited measure and that true transparency would require making the complete, redacted investigation files public.</p>
