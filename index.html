          <p>Amazon is investing heavily in automating its logistics, potentially saving billions annually by 2030. According to Morgan Stanley, the company is experimenting with delivery robots, including AI-powered humanoid robots that could deliver packages directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans, reducing delivery times and labor costs. These robots are being tested at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course, marking the next phase in Amazon's automation strategy. The analyst firm projects that increased robotics in warehouses could lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030, with Amazon's retail business being a significant beneficiary of generative AI, enhancing profitability and market dominance in logistics (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland to El Salvador, is returning to the United States to face criminal charges. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants within the U.S. over nearly a decade. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia transported thousands of non-citizens, including some children and members of the MS-13 gang, from Texas to other parts of the country. The Justice Department's move follows a federal judge's order to facilitate his return to the U.S. after his initial deportation violated a 2019 court order.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering selling or giving away his Tesla Model S, following a dramatic rupture in his alliance with Elon Musk. Trump purchased the electric vehicle to show support for Tesla and Musk, who faced criticism for his involvement in DOGE. The decision to potentially dispose of the Tesla reflects the depth of the fallout between the two figures. At the time of purchase, there had been a series of attacks on Tesla vehicles and locations linked to the company.</p>

          <p>Senior figures in the Scottish National Party (SNP) have pledged to learn lessons after Labour's surprise victory in the Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse by-election.

The result follows a difficult period for the SNP since last summer's general election. Scottish Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said the SNP would need to closely examine the results and adjust their strategy for the upcoming Holyrood elections.</p>

          <p>'Dangerous Animals' is a shark horror film directed by Sean Byrne, starring Hassie Harrison as a surfer kidnapped by a boat captain. The film draws from serial-killer thrillers and shark survival stories, but lacks the narrative twists and thematic depth of Byrne's previous work. Despite a juicy setup, the movie is straightforward and underwhelming, offering little of the grim poetry of Byrne’s previous work and far too much of the narrative predictability that in the past he astutely sidestepped. While it boasts technical craft, the story suffers from boneheaded plot twists and underdeveloped ideas.</p>
