        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are considering a tax package that would eliminate several consumer tax breaks related to clean energy, potentially impacting households interested in electric vehicles and home energy efficiency upgrades. The proposed changes would terminate tax credits for new and used EVs, as well as incentives for projects like installing solar panels and heat pumps, after 2025, significantly earlier than the current law allows. Experts advise consumers considering these investments to act quickly to claim the breaks this year, especially by opting for upfront rebates at dealerships for EV purchases. The proposed repeal aims to raise money for a broader tax package, but it would also increase the U.S. deficit by trillions over the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land redistribution policies, which allow the government to seize land without compensation in the public interest, is under scrutiny given his own administration's use of eminent domain to build the border wall. The New York Times article highlights the case of Richard Drawe, a South Texas farmer who reluctantly allowed the government to build on his land after the administration filed lawsuits against landowners to secure space for the wall. Drawe, a Trump supporter, expressed disillusionment with the eminent domain laws, noting the wall disrupted his idyllic rural life despite receiving compensation for the land and the diminished value of his farm. This juxtaposition underscores Trump's selective application of principles regarding land rights.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cautioned that financial markets may be undergoing a "fundamental regime change" due to investors rethinking the riskiness of U.S. assets amid ongoing trade tensions. The ECB's Financial Stability Review noted market sensitivity to U.S. tariff policies and shifts away from traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. This reassessment could trigger broader shifts in global capital flows with far-reaching consequences. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos suggested there is a risk of a market correction due to elevated valuations and strong uncertainty, urging caution among investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sued DOGE for access to its records and plans for government overhaul. The administration claims executive privilege, arguing DOGE is a presidential advisory board and not subject to FOIA.

          <h2>What Happens When Buy Now, Pay Later Debt Goes to Collections?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) debt can be sold to debt collectors if payments are not made, potentially impacting credit scores. BNPL providers typically attempt to collect the debt in-house before outsourcing to third-party agencies or selling the debt. Consumers should verify the debt, understand their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and negotiate a settlement or payment plan. If BNPL debt is part of a larger debt problem, exploring debt relief options may be necessary. The article advises taking action to address BNPL debt in collections to avoid further financial consequences.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is investigating whether the Trump administration violated an order barring deportations to countries other than migrants' own, by deporting individuals to South Sudan. Judge Brian Murphy ordered the government to maintain custody and control of anyone deported to South Sudan, to ensure their return if the removals are deemed unlawful. Lawyers claim at least 12 migrants were sent to South Sudan, including one from Myanmar and another from Vietnam. The Justice Department stated that the migrant from Myanmar was deported to Myanmar, not South Sudan, but declined to reveal the destination of the Vietnamese migrant, citing classified information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UnitedHealth Group has been secretly paying nursing homes bonuses to reduce hospital transfers for ailing residents, a tactic that has saved the company millions but at times endangered residents' health, according to a Guardian investigation. Nursing home residents who needed immediate hospital care failed to receive it after interventions from UnitedHealth staffers. One current UnitedHealth nurse practitioner filed a congressional complaint about the nursing home program, alleging that incidents are hidden, downplayed, and minimized. The program's cost-cutting schemes were possible because of UnitedHealth's sprawling nature, allowing the company to influence critical healthcare decisions for residents.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has reinstated Pete Rose, who died last year, after years of ineligibility due to gambling on the game, a decision that follows public pressure from President Trump. While MLB claims Rose's death prompted the change, it follows Trump's repeated calls for Rose's Hall of Fame inclusion and a meeting between Commissioner Rob Manfred and Trump. The reinstatement, part of a new policy for banned players, is controversial given Rose's violation of baseball's most sacred rule and his initial denial of wrongdoing. The decision now rests with the Hall of Fame's Classic Baseball Era Committee.</p>

          <p>The FDA is planning a major policy shift to limit COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with high-risk conditions, citing concerns about the necessity of annual boosters for healthy people. This potential change has sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that annual boosters are not worth the risk for the general population. The FDA's vaccine committee is scheduled to meet to discuss the latest data on vaccine safety and efficacy. The new framework would allow an estimated 33% of the U.S. population to be eligible for the shots, matching recommendations from other countries.</p>
