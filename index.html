          <p>A privately-built Japanese lander, Resilience, experienced a mission-ending 'hard' landing on the moon after its laser rangefinder malfunctioned during descent. The lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently, leading to a crash landing. Ispace, the builder, is analyzing telemetry data to determine the cause of the failure and aims to restore trust with stakeholders. The mission carried cameras, science payloads, a rover, and an art project; this marks the second unsuccessful lunar landing attempt by Ispace. The incident highlights the challenges and difficulties associated with achieving low-cost spacecraft landings on the moon, as only Firefly Aerospace has successfully touched down and carried out its mission. </p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as chairman of Reform UK, stating that working to get the party elected is no longer 'a good use of my time.' His resignation follows criticism of a Reform MP's call to ban the burka, which Yusuf deemed 'dumb.' Nigel Farage expressed regret over Yusuf's departure, acknowledging his talent and contributions to the party's recent electoral successes. Yusuf, a 'proud British Muslim patriot,' played a key role in professionalizing the party and attracting donors, but his interpersonal skills were reportedly a point of contention. The article also notes the departure of Nathaniel Fried, who led Reform UK's 'Doge teams' initiative, following Yusuf's resignation. </p>

          <p>Driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods, more retailers and brands are offering products with fewer ingredients, following the lead of M&S's 'Only' range. While some shoppers appreciate the simpler ingredient lists, especially those with food allergies, nutritionists caution against sacrificing fortified nutrients. Experts argue that the term 'ultra-processed food' is not always a reliable indicator of health, as processing can ensure food safety and extend shelf life. Food brands are exploring new processing and packaging technologies to create less processed products, and marketing efforts are expected to emphasize the virtues of simpler foods. </p>

Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city's focus is on providing shelter, mental health services, and drug treatment, while creating safer public spaces. While arrests are a last resort, the city's efforts have led to nearly half of the homeless population being sheltered, a 35% increase since 2019. </p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that in many states, young offenders are denied credit for 'dead time,' the time spent in juvenile detention before adjudication. Unlike the adult system, this time often doesn't count toward their ultimate incarceration, extending their confinement. Policy experts argue this practice wastes resources, negatively impacts youth, and creates disparities in treatment. While the juvenile system is meant to be rehabilitative, the lack of time credit stems from the focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. The article highlights the challenges and negative impacts of this system on young people's lives. </p>

          <p>Japanese startup ispace Inc. has announced that its attempt to land on the Moon has failed after losing contact with its lander. The Resilience lander, which was carrying a rover and equipment for experiments, lifted off in January with the goal of being the first private company to successfully land on the lunar surface. Communication was lost during the landing attempt, leading to the confirmation of the mission's failure. This marks a setback for Japan's efforts in private lunar exploration. </p>
