            <p>Manchester, England, played a pivotal role in the rise of the working class during the Industrial Revolution, inspiring thinkers like Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. The city's rapid industrialization and harsh living conditions for workers fueled demands for rights and representation. Manchester became a symbol of working-class struggle, influencing political discourse and labor movements worldwide.

Courts are weighing the legality of his deportation, especially after he was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, irrespective of his character. Garcia maintains he fled El Salvador due to gang threats and built a life in the U.S., supporting his family and pursuing education.</p>

The alliance between the two leaders has led to the internationalization of these authoritarian tactics, raising concerns about human rights and the rule of law.

Experts suggest that the expectation of higher inflation could become self-fulfilling, giving companies cover to increase profits. A study on Trump's previous tariffs on washing machines found that prices rose even on domestic machines not subject to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The Guardian reports that these behaviors are "flooding UK schools."

This issue is complex and requires a multi-faceted approach to address the root causes of discrimination and promote inclusive environments.</p>
