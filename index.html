          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing in April has raised concerns among experts about potential tax increases in the autumn. The UK government borrowed £20.2bn, £1bn more than in April of the previous year, making it the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. Ruth Gregory from Capital Economics suggests that tax rises are becoming more likely due to weaker economic growth forecasts. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones stated the government has taken decisions to stabilize public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's economy is struggling to recover, facing challenges such as high electricity prices, labor shortages, and bureaucracy, with experts projecting stagnation in 2025. The German Council of Economic Experts anticipates a "period of considerable sluggishness," ruling out a rapid upturn. Federal Economics Minister Katherina Reiche aims to introduce measures by mid-July to reduce electricity tax and reform the labor market. The government plans to invest €500 billion in infrastructure over twelve years, but economists warn against misallocating these funds to finance election promises.</p>

          <p>A High Court injunction has temporarily halted the UK government from finalizing talks on the Chagos Islands deal, following a case brought by two Chagossian women. The agreement would transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while allowing the UK and US to maintain a military base for 99 years. The legal action was initiated by Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, who seek to return to the islands but are currently prevented from doing so. The court is scheduled to hear the case again, with the judge ordering the UK to maintain jurisdiction over the territory until further notice.</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the example set by Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009, highlighting the importance of knowing when to step aside from power. He contrasts Souter's decision with the trend of many politicians and judges clinging to power well into old age, citing examples like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Joe Biden. French argues that the desire to stay powerful is often fueled by enablers and a culture that defines people through their careers, emphasizing the need for leaders to prioritize deeper aspects of life and allow the next generation to take its turn.</p>

          <p>President Trump will release a report identifying drivers of chronic disease in children, including ultra-processed foods, vaccination, and environmental toxins, spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The report, from the White House’s Make America Healthy Again Commission, aims to declare a health crisis and offer a blueprint for investigation and reform. However, the report is generating pushback from Republicans and the agriculture industry over fears about Kennedy's stance against agricultural chemicals like glyphosate. The report omits smoking and excessive alcohol use, which the CDC lists as main causes of chronic disease.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's pressure campaign against Harvard University has expanded beyond antisemitism concerns to include curriculum changes, hiring overhauls, and admissions policy adjustments. The effort involves multiple investigations across at least six agencies and has resulted in funding cuts and freezes totaling nearly $4 billion. These actions are part of a broader strategy to reshape academia's race-based admissions policies and address perceived liberal bias.

The province, often called "Canada's Texas," is home to a dedicated minority of separatists whose voice has been amplified by President Trump’s calls to annex Canada. Premier Danielle Smith seeks to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with the federal government to unshackle its oil industry from climate-focused regulations.

Two studies published in Current Biology identified a missing piece of DNA near the ARHGAP36 gene responsible for the orange color.

The mutation activates the ARHGAP36 gene, which gets turned on in pigment cells where it is not normally active, intersecting with the pathway responsible for red hair in humans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strategy of initially proposing high tariffs, only to later reduce them, has created a sense of relief among investors, even when the reduced rates are still higher than before. Yair Reiner, a kitchenware business owner, experienced this firsthand when tariffs on his Chinese-made products were lowered from 145% to 30%. Experts say this approach uses the anchor effect, making a 30% tariff feel like a relief, despite it being significantly higher than pre-trade war rates. However, this uncertainty causes problems for long-term planning and investment.</p>
