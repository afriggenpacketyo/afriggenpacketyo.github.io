          <p>Donald Trump questioned Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war in Ukraine after meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky at Pope Francis's funeral. Trump noted Moscow's strikes on Kyiv and suggested Putin might be insincere about peace. The meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between Trump and Zelensky since February, with both sides offering differing accounts of their discussion. Trump hinted at using banking or secondary sanctions to deal with Putin, while Zelensky described the meeting as potentially historic and Ukraine's Foreign Minister posted an image of the meeting on X with the caption: "No words are needed to describe the importance of this historic meeting. Two leaders working for peace in St. Peter's Basilica."</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Her family confirmed that she had been a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Prince Andrew, claims which Andrew denied, and a settlement was reached in 2022. Her attorney remembered her as a dear friend and champion for other victims, and Giuffre had formed a nonprofit to support sex trafficking survivors.

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in American confidence in Donald Trump, including among some Republicans, across key issues like the economy and immigration. A majority of respondents described Trump's second term as "scary," with only a minority believing he focuses on the right priorities. The polls indicate historically low approval ratings for Trump early in his term, with disapproval of his handling of the economy, trade policies, and immigration. The data suggests growing fatigue among Americans after a period marked by financial market volatility and controversial deportations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faced criticism for deporting a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras and separating a Cuban-born mother from her one-year-old daughter. Lawyers in both cases claim their clients were arrested during routine check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with little to no due process. The ACLU and other groups condemned the deportations, calling them a shocking abuse of power. The actions have sparked legal challenges and raised concerns about the administration's handling of immigration matters.</p>
