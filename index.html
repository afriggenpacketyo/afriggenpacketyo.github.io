Li, previously head of the Organization Department, now leads the United Front Work Department, while Shi assumes the Organization Department's helm. This unprecedented swap, with no prior instances in the Party's history, raises questions about internal power dynamics and potential shifts in policy direction within the Chinese government.</p>
