          <p>This article showcases an unusual agricultural technique used by cherry growers in Central Washington to save their valuable crops from summer rainfall. To prevent the delicate fruit from becoming waterlogged and rupturing, farmers employ helicopters to fly low over the orchards, using the powerful rotor wash to effectively blow-dry the trees. The practice highlights an innovative and fruitful alliance between the aviation and agriculture industries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose 30% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, effective August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, the president cited Mexico's perceived failure to curb narco-trafficking and the EU's "far from Reciprocal" trade relationship as justifications. The move represents a major escalation in trade disputes with two of the United States' largest trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from conducting "indiscriminate" arrests without reasonable suspicion. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by individuals who were arrested at a bus stop, with the judge citing a "mountain of evidence" of unconstitutional practices. The order specifically prohibits arrests based solely on factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being in a particular location.</p>
