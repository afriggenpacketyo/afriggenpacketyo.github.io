            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 14:44:05 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Justice Department has assured a federal judge in Colorado that accused migrant gang members will have at least 24 hours to challenge their deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, a move contested by the ACLU as insufficient time. This development follows the Supreme Court's block on AEA deportations of Venezuelan migrants in Texas, highlighting concerns over due process. The ACLU argues that the 24-hour notice is inadequate for filing habeas petitions, emphasizing the potential life-or-death consequences of immediate removals. The Trump administration's use of the AEA to deport alleged gang members to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison has sparked legal battles, with critics questioning the justification and potential human rights implications.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffers from accessing sensitive personal data held by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The lawsuit, brought by several unions and advocacy groups, alleges that DOGE's actions violate privacy laws and other regulations. The order restricts DOGE's access to personally identifiable information, including Social Security numbers, medical records, and financial data. It also mandates the deletion of any non-anonymized data in DOGE's possession and prohibits the installation of software on SSA systems.</p>

            <p>Reports suggest that Amazon may be scaling back its AI infrastructure expansion, potentially joining Microsoft in a period of digesting recent investments. While Wells Fargo indicated a pause in Amazon's colocation data center leasing discussions, Cowen analysts suggest this reflects a shift towards self-owned and powered data centers for greater efficiency. Other major players like Meta, Alphabet, and Oracle remain active in their AI infrastructure efforts. The upcoming earnings reports from these hyperscalers will provide clarity on their capital expenditure plans and the overall trajectory of AI spending (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Wells Fargo analysts report that Amazon has delayed some commitments related to new data center leases, signaling potential caution in spending plans amid economic concerns. This follows similar reports of Microsoft slowing down early build-outs, even as both companies aggressively invest in cloud infrastructure to meet the demands of generative AI. The analysts emphasize that Amazon isn't canceling signed deals, and CEO Andy Jassy previously stated that the company wouldn't cut back on data center construction. These developments come as tech stocks face pressure due to proposed tariffs, raising the prospect of higher import costs and a potential economic slowdown.</p>

            <p>Two German teenagers, Charlotte Pohl and Maria Lepère, were denied entry to the U.S. and detained in Honolulu after border officers deemed their travel plans "suspicious." Despite holding the required ESTA, the teens were interrogated, allegedly subjected to body scans and strip searches, and ultimately deported due to concerns about potential illegal work intentions, stemming from their lack of fully booked accommodation for their five-week stay. They were handcuffed, placed in a holding cell, and eventually sent back to Germany via Tokyo and Qatar. This incident has led to Germany updating its travel advisory to the U.S., emphasizing that ESTA approval doesn't guarantee entry.</p>

            <p>Experts offer mixed opinions on whether mortgage rates will soon drop below 6%, a level that could provide significant financial relief to potential homebuyers. Some believe a drop is possible as inflation cools and the Federal Reserve considers rate cuts, while others are less optimistic due to economic uncertainty. Factors influencing mortgage rates include inflation trends, Federal Reserve policy, and the 10-year Treasury bond market. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, experts advise buyers to prioritize affordability and long-term financial goals over timing the market (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump will meet with executives from major retailers, including Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's, to discuss the impact of his trade policies. Tariffs pose a threat to retailers already facing a challenging economic landscape, where consumers are seeking low prices. The meeting comes as retailers grapple with the potential effects of tariffs on their import-heavy business models. The scheduled meeting was first reported by Bloomberg earlier Monday.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to the lowest point of his presidency, driven by discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. The survey reveals that the economic optimism that followed Trump's election has waned, with more Americans expressing pessimism about the economy and the stock market. While Trump retains strong support within his Republican base, he has experienced a significant decline in approval among Democrats and independents. Americans disapprove of tariffs and are increasingly concerned about a potential recession.</p>

While Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch seemed sympathetic to arguments against the PSTF, Kavanaugh and Barrett's questioning suggested they were inclined to preserve health insurers' obligations under Obamacare.
