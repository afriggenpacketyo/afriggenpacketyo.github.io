          <p>The FBI is alerting the public to a sophisticated scam where criminals mail unsolicited packages containing only a QR code. This tactic, an evolution of the "brushing scam," preys on the recipient's curiosity to trick them into scanning the code. Scanning can lead to fraudulent websites that steal personal and financial information or install malware on the user's device. To stay safe, authorities advise against scanning unsolicited codes, using security software, and reporting any suspicious packages to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Sébastien Lecornu, the former armed forces minister, as the new prime minister. This decision follows the ousting of his predecessor, François Bayrou, in a vote of no confidence over a controversial budget proposal. Lecornu, the fifth prime minister of Macron's second term, faces the immediate and difficult task of navigating a divided parliament to pass a new budget. The appointment has already drawn criticism from both left and right political factions, signaling continued political challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage interest rates reaching an 11-month low and a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated, homebuyers are re-evaluating their options. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are presented as a potentially attractive choice, currently offering lower initial rates than traditional 30-year fixed loans. An ARM could provide borrowers with lower immediate costs, time to gauge market trends, and protection against short-term rate volatility before the rate adjusts in several years. This article suggests that for certain buyers, this could be a strategic way to enter the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has expressed concerns about the U.S. economy, stating that it is clearly weakening. His comments followed a significant downward revision in the Labor Department's jobs data, which showed 911,000 fewer jobs were created through March 2025 than initially estimated. While noting that consumer spending remains relatively stable for now, Dimon highlighted that the overall economic picture is mixed and uncertain. He suggested that while the Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates, the move may not be consequential enough to alter the economy's trajectory.</p>

          <p>A recent CDC report suggests that Chagas disease, a potentially fatal condition transmitted by the "kissing bug," may be becoming endemic in the U.S. Previously considered non-endemic, locally acquired human cases have now been reported in eight states, with the insect vector found in 32 states. The disease is caused by a parasite passed through the bug's feces, often near a bite wound on a person's face. While not all infected individuals show symptoms, the chronic phase can lead to severe heart and digestive problems, raising public health concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has released a report with 128 recommendations to address rising chronic diseases in children. The "Make America Healthy Again" plan targets poor diet, chemical exposure, and inactivity but has drawn criticism for its lack of specific execution strategies. Public health experts and advocates point out that the report's ambitious goals seem to conflict with the administration's other actions, such as cuts to food assistance and Medicaid. Critics argue that without concrete steps and resources, the plan is unlikely to be effective.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced a significant downward revision, indicating the U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than initially reported. This annual benchmark revision, which was larger than anticipated, suggests the labor market was cooling more significantly last year than was understood. The new data points to a weaker economy with less momentum entering the current year. This development strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to support the job market.</p>

          <p>This article presents a personal reflection on how the erosion of democracy can feel deceptively normal until a breaking point is reached. Drawing parallels between the rise of authoritarianism in Venezuela under Hugo Chávez and contemporary political anxieties, the author describes the slow disintegration of civil liberties. The essay argues that for many citizens, the experience is not one of dramatic confrontation but a passive adaptation to a gradually shrinking space of freedom. It serves as a cautionary tale about the subtle ways societies can drift toward autocracy.</p>

          <p>With an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, savers are facing new decisions on where to place their money, particularly concerning certificates of deposit (CDs). Short-term CDs currently offer higher rates and greater flexibility, allowing savers to reinvest sooner as market conditions evolve. Conversely, long-term CDs offer the advantage of locking in today's still-high rates for an extended period, protecting against future rate decreases. The article also suggests a CD laddering strategy, which combines both approaches to balance security and adaptability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal prosecutor in New York has warned that employers should expect more large-scale immigration enforcement actions at workplaces. The warning came after 57 people in the country illegally were detained during a raid on a snack bar manufacturing plant in upstate New York. The U.S. Attorney stated that his office will aggressively pursue investigations against employers who hire unauthorized workers, declaring that the "bad old days of turning a blind eye are over." This signals a continuation of the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, the U.S. Transportation Secretary has threatened to pull the city's federal transit funding. Citing public safety concerns, Secretary Sean Duffy stated that cities unable to keep their transportation systems safe do not deserve taxpayer money. The threat has transformed a local tragedy into a national political issue, with Charlotte's mayor acknowledging a "tragic failure by the courts" and pledging to increase police presence on public transit.</p>

          <p>Oliver North and his former secretary, Fawn Hall, two central figures in the 1980s Iran-Contra affair, were quietly married last month in Virginia. North was a National Security Council staffer at the heart of the scandal involving arms sales to Iran to fund rebels in Nicaragua. Hall famously admitted to shredding documents and smuggling others out of the White House complex to protect her boss. Nearly 40 years after the scandal rocked the Reagan administration, the two have reconnected and formalized their relationship.</p>

          <p>Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who led controversial immigration raids in Southern California, has been deployed to Chicago to lead a new enforcement blitz. Bovino became a public face of the Trump administration's crackdown, overseeing operations that arrested unauthorized immigrants far from the border. His arrival in Chicago signals an expansion of this aggressive interior enforcement strategy, which has been criticized by local officials and civil rights groups. The move is part of a broader push to involve Customs and Border Protection more heavily in domestic immigration sweeps.</p>

          <p>Sixty years ago, on September 9, 1965, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax achieved baseball immortality by throwing a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs. In one of the most dominant pitching performances ever, Koufax retired all 27 batters he faced without a single player reaching base. The game, famously called by legendary announcer Vin Scully, remains a celebrated moment in sports history. It was the crowning achievement of a remarkable but brief career for Koufax, who retired a year later at the peak of his abilities.</p>
