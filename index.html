        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Football Association has ruled that transgender women will not be allowed to compete in women's football starting June 1st, a decision praised by some as overdue and criticized by others as discriminatory. Sex Matters director Fiona McAnena deemed the prior policy "nonsensical," while former Olympic medalist Sharron Davies called the new ruling "great news" for the safety and fairness of women's sports. Natalie Washington of Football vs Transphobia expressed concern that transgender women may abandon football due to the ban, while Kick It Out urged solidarity with the trans community. The FA maintains that the decision aligns with a recent Supreme Court ruling, though critics fear it will further marginalize transgender individuals in sports.</p>

          <p>A pro-Trump legal nonprofit, America First Legal (AFL), has filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) against Henry Ford Health (HFH) alleging discriminatory Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices. The AFL claims HFH uses federal funds to promote racial quotas in hiring, prioritize organ transplants based on race, and favor "identity-restricted" students for scholarships. Consumers' Research launched an ad campaign accusing the hospital of prioritizing politics over patients, specifically citing transgender treatments for children. The AFL is requesting an immediate investigation, suspension of discriminatory policies, and penalties for noncompliance, arguing that HFH's practices violate civil rights laws and misuse taxpayer funds.</p>

Minnesota's size dominated the Lakers on the boards, exposing a lack of depth at center.

          <p>The World Trade Center Health Program, which monitors and treats individuals exposed to toxic dust during the 9/11 attacks, is facing a crisis due to recent staffing cuts and agency turmoil. These cuts have disrupted the program's ability to provide timely care, leading to concerns about delayed cancer diagnoses and unmet mental health needs. Advocates warn that the federal government is breaking its promise to "never forget" the victims of 9/11. The program, established through the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, is struggling to meet rising demand due to funding projections that failed to account for medical inflation or growing enrollment.</p>

Credit counseling agencies can provide debt analysis and recommend solutions like debt management plans. A debt consolidation loan can lower interest rates, but requires commitment to paying off credit cards. Prioritizing debt with the highest interest rates and late fees is also crucial.

Reform hopes to win hundreds of council seats and potentially a special election, while the Liberal Democrats and Greens also aim to advance.

          <p>Experts weigh in on whether it is easier to qualify for a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) or a home equity loan, considering factors like interest rates and debt-to-income ratio. HELOCs may be easier to qualify for due to lower rates and more flexible DTI requirements, but the choice depends on individual needs and how the funds will be used. A HELOC offers flexibility for ongoing projects, while a home equity loan is better for one-time expenses. HELOC rates are variable, so it's important to consider long-term affordability.

          <p>A spring heatwave in the UK is expected to affect plants in various ways, with experts advising on how to mitigate potential harm. Indoor plants may suffer from increased temperatures and direct sunlight, requiring shading or relocation. Outdoor plants, especially newly planted ones, will need more water to encourage deep root systems. Fruit and vegetable harvests may occur earlier, but caution is advised due to relatively low nighttime temperatures. Trees, in particular, could face stress due to the combination of warmer weather and existing soil moisture deficits.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that his tariffs could lead to fewer and more expensive products in the U.S., suggesting that American children might have "two dolls instead of 30 dolls." He maintained that China would suffer more from the trade war, blaming his Democratic predecessor for any economic setbacks. Trump's remarks followed a report showing the U.S. economy shrank during the first three months of the year, which he attributed to companies front-running the tariffs by increasing imports.</p>

          <p>The article explores whether pronatalist policies, aimed at boosting birth rates, would benefit children. While policies like giving money to parents could directly improve children's well-being, others may have little impact. The author discusses the potential benefits of a more child-centered society but also notes that pronatalism often aligns with patriarchal values. Ultimately, the article argues that policies supporting children's basic needs, like food, housing, health care, and education, are more crucial than simply increasing the number of births.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's first 100 days have been highly beneficial to the U.S. meat industry, with several actions taken to reduce regulations and increase industry profits. These actions include speeding up slaughter lines, rolling back food safety measures, and gutting the USDA's animal welfare research department. While the tariffs have been a negative for the industry, the administration has also provided bailouts for bird flu and banned certain terms related to agricultural pollution. These policies are expected to have negative consequences for the environment, workers, animals, and consumers.</p>

The BOJ has revised its forecast for achieving its 2% inflation target to the latter half of the three years through March 2028, a year later than initially projected.
