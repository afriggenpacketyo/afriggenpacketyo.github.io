          <p>Hurricane Erick, the first major hurricane of the Eastern Pacific season, made landfall in western Oaxaca, Mexico, as a Category 3 storm. Despite being downgraded from a Category 4, the National Hurricane Center warned of life-threatening flooding and mudslides due to strong winds and heavy rain. The hurricane is expected to weaken rapidly as it moves over the mountains and is likely to dissipate by early Friday. Acapulco, which was previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023, is among the areas facing potential impacts. The storm's categorization focuses on wind, while the most deadly elements are water hazards like storm surge and inland flooding, which pose significant threats. The optimism score for this article is relatively low, reflecting the potential for devastating consequences from the hurricane's impact on vulnerable communities. </p>

This setback follows previous fiery launch attempts of the Starship, which is central to NASA's Artemis missions and Elon Musk's ambitions to colonize Mars. The incident raises concerns about the rocket's reliability and the timeline for future missions.

          <p>Democrats are accusing the Trump administration of weaponizing law enforcement to silence political foes, citing recent arrests and detentions of Democratic officials.

Incidents include the handcuffing of Senator Alex Padilla, the arrests of Representative LaMonica McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, and the detention of New York City Comptroller Brad Lander.

          <p>Julius Malema, the leader of South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), has been banned from entering the UK by the Home Office. The UK cited Malema's statements calling for the potential "slaughter of white people" and his support for Hamas as reasons for denying his visa request. The EFF condemned the decision, stating that it would not trade its revolutionary beliefs for a visa and would continue to support the oppressed, particularly the Palestinian people. Malema, a critic of Western imperialism, advocates for the nationalization of white-owned land in South Africa to address historical injustices. The optimism score is moderate, considering the potential for increased racial tensions in South Africa due to the ban.</p>

          <p>Google is facing a setback as an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended dismissing the tech giant's appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro antitrust fine. The advocate general at the European Court of Justice advised the court to uphold the fine, which had been reduced from 4.34 billion euros in 2022 by the EU's General Court. The fine is related to a long-running antitrust case surrounding Google's Android operating system and its alleged anti-competitive practices.

The guidance covers almost every aspect of university life, from protests to debates, training, and teaching. Universities had requested clarity from the OfS on how to best uphold freedom of speech, after the University of Sussex was fined for failing to do so in March.

The party needs channels that build audiences by being purely entertaining and then, on rare occasions, bring on candidates as guests.
