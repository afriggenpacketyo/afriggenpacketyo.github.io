          <p>Tensions between Israel and Australia have escalated, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accusing his Australian counterpart of betrayal. The diplomatic friction follows Australia's decision to cancel the visa of a far-right Israeli politician, Simcha Rothman, and its announcement to formally recognize a Palestinian state. In response, Israel has revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu's sharp criticism claims that the Australian government has abandoned its Jewish community amid rising antisemitism, a charge fueled by these recent policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Following high-level meetings, the concept of "security guarantees" for a post-war Ukraine is being defined, though full NATO membership remains unlikely for now. The article explores a spectrum of possibilities being considered by a "Coalition of the Willing," including policing Ukraine's airspace from bases in neighboring countries and securing Black Sea commercial routes. A key challenge is creating guarantees robust enough to deter future Russian aggression without being so provocative that Moscow rejects them entirely. The success of any agreement will heavily depend on the level of commitment from the United States, particularly regarding potential air support.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has dispatched several guided-missile destroyers and thousands of Marines to patrol international waters near Venezuela. This deployment is a significant escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to combat drug trafficking, particularly the flow of fentanyl into the United States. The White House has labeled the Maduro regime in Venezuela a "narco-terror cartel" and is increasing pressure on its leadership. The operation aims to cover international waters and skies with warships, spy planes, and a submarine to interdict drug pipelines.</p>

          <p>A tragic bus crash in western Afghanistan has resulted in the deaths of over 50 people, most of whom were Afghans recently deported from Iran. The bus was en route to Kabul from the Islam Qala border crossing when it collided first with a motorcycle and then with a fuel truck, causing it to burst into flames. This incident highlights the perilous journey faced by many Afghans who are returning from neighboring countries. In recent months, Iran and Pakistan have increased pressure on Afghan migrants to leave, leading to a large-scale return of people to a crisis-stricken Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued guidance recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as six months, a stance that directly contrasts with the Trump administration's federal health agencies. The CDC, following a recent overhaul, now advises that vaccination for healthy children be a matter of "shared clinical decision-making" rather than a universal recommendation. The AAP argues its position is based on long-standing scientific processes and is crucial amid a climate of misinformation. This divergence has sparked a political clash, with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accusing the AAP of being influenced by corporate interests.</p>

Officials in North Carolina's Outer Banks have ordered mandatory evacuations for some islands, fearing key highways could become impassable due to waves up to 15 feet. The storm previously caused widespread power outages in Puerto Rico.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Nicole Collier of Texas has filed a habeas corpus petition, alleging she is being illegally restrained inside the state Capitol. Collier, who refused a police escort intended to ensure her presence for a key vote, claims she was told she would be arrested if she tried to leave the building. She is part of a group of Democrats who previously left the state to block a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. Now back in Austin, Collier argues that while lawmakers can be compelled to attend a session, there is no legal basis to detain them once they are present.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order to end mail-in voting, claiming the practice is corrupt and benefits Democrats. However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the authority to dictate how states conduct their elections. The U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections, with a secondary role for Congress, but no specified role for the executive branch. This move follows the 2024 election, where mail-in ballots were widely used by voters from both parties.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown moon has been discovered orbiting the ice giant Uranus, bringing the planet's total number of known satellites to 29. The tiny moon, temporarily designated S/2025 U1, measures only about six miles in diameter and was identified using data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Its small size is likely why it was missed by previous observations, including NASA's Voyager 2 flyby in 1986. The discovery could suggest that more small moons are yet to be found around Uranus, providing further insight into the planet's complex and potentially chaotic history.</p>

The event, moved to the week before the main singles draws and featuring a shortened format, aims to attract top stars with a significant prize pool. Despite the loss, Raducanu and Alcaraz were crowd favorites in a festive atmosphere at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The tournament has polarized opinion, with some doubles specialists viewing it as a glorified exhibition that devalues the traditional Grand Slam format.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has significantly broadened its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum to encompass over 400 new product categories. Effective this week, the expanded levies now apply to a wide range of derivative products, including machinery, construction materials, fire extinguishers, and auto parts that contain or are made with the metals. The Commerce Department stated the action is designed to support American industries and close loopholes for circumvention. This move is expected to impact at least $320 billion worth of imports, a substantial increase from previous estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan national who has lived in the U.S. for 16 years, has chosen to self-deport rather than risk being detained by ICE and separated from his American wife and three children. Despite having no criminal record, Kangethe faces removal proceedings due to a 2014 ruling on a previous marriage, leaving him in legal limbo. His story illustrates the profound personal cost of U.S. immigration policies, as he packs up his life in Michigan and leaves his family to face an uncertain financial future. He sees his departure as the "safest option" to avoid a potentially worse outcome.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose after the company reaffirmed its full-year sales outlook, signaling confidence despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The home improvement retailer anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year. While acknowledging a "deferral mindset" among homeowners for large projects due to economic uncertainty, the company noted encouraging signs, including a rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. The report marks the first time since 2014 that Home Depot has fallen short on both top and bottom-line estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent high-profile summits with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Donald Trump faces significant hurdles in his effort to broker peace. While Trump has shown openness to providing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and is arranging a trilateral meeting, tangible progress remains limited. A key obstacle is that Putin may not genuinely desire an end to the conflict while his forces are making advances on the battlefield. The peace process is further complicated by Trump's own mercurial diplomatic style and potential skepticism from his non-interventionist political base.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed his administration to apply the same tactics used on universities to scrutinize and pressure museums over content he deems "woke." In a social media post, Trump specifically criticized the Smithsonian Institution for focusing on negative aspects of American history like slavery, vowing to compel museums to present more positive narratives. This follows a White House request for materials from several Smithsonian museums and suggests that federal funding could be used as leverage, similar to the strategy employed against universities accused of fostering unwelcome ideologies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney's office has launched a criminal investigation into the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department over allegations of systematically manipulating crime statistics. The probe reportedly examines whether officials intentionally misclassified violent crimes as lesser offenses to create the appearance of a safer city. This federal inquiry escalates the conflict between the Trump administration and D.C. officials, who have cited falling crime rates to argue against increased federal control over local policing. The police union has supported the investigation, claiming there was a directive from command staff to keep crime stats down.</p>
