          <p>Japan's bond market is raising alarms about potential capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields climb to near-record highs. Analysts suggest that increasing Japanese government bond yields could trigger repatriation, with Japanese investors withdrawing funds from the U.S., impacting global markets due to increased borrowing costs. Some experts warn of a potential "global financial market Armageddon" if yields continue to rise, particularly affecting U.S. tech stocks as the yen strengthens. However, others believe the impact may be a gradual decline rather than a severe shock, given the structural alliance between the U.S. and Japan and the concentration of foreign holdings in U.S. equities.

          <p>The U.S. government has directed embassies to halt scheduling new student visa appointments as it prepares to broaden social media vetting for applicants. This pause, outlined in a memo to diplomatic posts, aims to enhance screening processes for student and foreign exchange visas. The move comes amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and some elite colleges, with concerns about antisemitism and admissions policies. The state department emphasizes the importance of thoroughly vetting individuals entering the country, while universities worry about the financial impact of reduced international student enrollment.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million by the water regulator Ofwat for breaches related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The penalty includes Â£104.5 million for sewage-related rule violations and an additional Â£18.2 million for "undeserved dividends." This marks the first time Ofwat has penalized a water company for dividend payments. The fines follow criticism of Thames Water's performance, including sewage discharges and leaks, as the company grapples with a Â£20 billion debt. Ofwat's chief executive stated that the fines reflect Thames Water's failure to protect the environment and meet its obligations.</p>

          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade that could significantly enhance the performance of jet engines for both military and civilian aircraft. The new alloy turbine blades can withstand temperatures up to 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) received the patent, solidifying its leadership in high-performance propulsion technologies. The innovation addresses the degradation of conventional turbine blades due to extreme heat exposure.</p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are finding it increasingly difficult to conduct business due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations. A survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China revealed that nearly three-quarters of businesses reported worsening operating conditions. Despite curbing investments in China, some European companies are increasing their purchases of Chinese components, making their supply chains more dependent on China. This trend is driven by lower prices and a weaker Chinese currency, making Chinese components more attractive.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth test flight, marking another setback in the company's efforts to develop a fully reusable spacecraft. While the vehicle successfully reached orbit, a propellant leak led to a loss of control during its suborbital trajectory, causing it to disintegrate upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Despite the failure, SpaceX emphasized that the test provided valuable data for future improvements. The company remains committed to its iterative approach to engineering and its goal of making life multiplanetary.</p>

He highlighted a decade of underinvestment and new pressures on police forces. Rowley stated that without significant investment, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing and no halving of knife crime or violence against women and girls, all of which are government promises.
