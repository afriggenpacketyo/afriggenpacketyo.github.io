          <p>The closure of a US duty-free loophole for low-value packages has increased prices for American consumers of online retailers like Shein and Temu.

          <p>The Trump administration eliminated a tariff loophole that allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the US duty-free.

The administration cited concerns about fentanyl smuggling and job losses in US warehousing and logistics as reasons for the change.
