          <p>José González Valencia, the brother-in-law of Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) leader Nemesio Rubén "El Mencho" Oseguera Cervantes, was sentenced to 30 years in a U.S. federal prison for orchestrating a drug trafficking operation and providing weapons to the cartel. González Valencia, also known as "Chepa," led the "Los Cuinis" group, which financed CJNG's drug trafficking operations using various methods to avoid detection. The U.S. government has been intensifying efforts to weaken the CJNG, designating it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and sanctioning its leaders, including El Mencho. El Mencho's son-in-law also pleaded guilty to money laundering in a separate case, underscoring the U.S. government's commitment to dismantling the cartel and prosecuting its members. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing nature of the cartel problem, but the sentence represents a victory in the fight against drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell approximately 2% following President Trump's decision to delay a potential military strike on Iran, hoping to allow space for negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. While Trump is holding back on military action, Israel is escalating its attacks on strategic and government targets within Iran after recent conflict. The decision to delay the strike has led to market speculation and price adjustments as investors assess the geopolitical landscape. The prices of both Brent crude and U.S. crude oil experienced significant decreases due to the shifting dynamics.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been indicted by a grand jury for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were found more than three years after she was reported missing in May 2020. Barry Morphew was previously charged with her murder in 2021, but those charges were dropped just before the trial was set to begin. The indictment reveals that Suzanne Morphew's body was found in September 2023, and her death was ruled a homicide caused by intoxication from a chemical mixture used for sedating animals. Investigators found that Barry Morphew had access to this chemical mixture and that Suzanne Morphew had expressed unhappiness in her marriage and planned to divorce her husband, which gives context to the state of their relationship.</p>

          <p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has voiced strong dissents against her Supreme Court colleagues, accusing them of using a "pure textualism" approach to achieve desired outcomes and favoring "moneyed interests." Jackson criticized Justice Gorsuch's majority opinion in an ADA case, arguing that it ignored the intent of Congress and reached a "stingy outcome." She also accused her colleagues of distorting the law to benefit major businesses, eroding public trust, and favoring the fuel industry over less powerful plaintiffs.

Khalil's arrest was widely criticized as an attack on free speech, and his release follows a series of defeats for the Trump administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students.

          <p>Jia Zhangke's latest film, "Caught by the Tides," is a reflexive remix of his career-long exploration of globalization and alienation in China. Drawing from nearly 25 years of footage, including outtakes from his most acclaimed films, Jia crafts a poignant story about the passage of time and its impact on individuals and nations. The film follows Qiaoqiao (Zhao Tao) as she navigates romantic despair and societal changes, offering a bittersweet sense of déjà vu for viewers familiar with Jia's filmography. The film serves as a primer on Jia's fascination with China's political, cultural, and economic evolution.</p>

          <p>Kroger has announced plans to close 60 of its supermarkets across the U.S. over the next 18 months, representing about 5% of its Kroger-branded stores. The grocery chain expects the closures to provide a modest financial benefit, with resulting savings invested in customer experience initiatives. All employees at affected stores will be offered roles at other Kroger locations. The announcement came as Kroger reported its first-quarter earnings, with sales dropping slightly compared to the same period a year earlier.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip planned for June 22. The initial rides will be in the Model Y, with a limited number of vehicles and access by invitation only. A Tesla Safety Monitor will be present in the front passenger seat, and rides will be limited to a geofenced area of the city, with remote drivers monitoring as a backup. While analysts are optimistic about the potential of robotaxis, Tesla faces pressure to deliver on its promises and catch up to competitors like Waymo.</p>
