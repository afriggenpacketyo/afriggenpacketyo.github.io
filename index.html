          <p>An article fact-checks several claims made by President Trump regarding autism, vaccines, and Tylenol use during pregnancy. It refutes his assertions about Amish children, the number of vaccines administered to children, and Tylenol causing autism, citing extensive medical evidence and expert consensus. The article highlights that medical professionals disagree with Trump's statements, emphasizing the known risks of fever in pregnancy and the genetic role in autism likelihood. It also addresses his suggestion to delay hepatitis B vaccination for newborns, directly contradicting World Health Organization and CDC guidance.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines, mirroring Wall Street's performance after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that equity prices are "fairly highly valued" and that the rate-cutting path remains uncertain. Major indices in Australia, Japan, and South Korea saw losses, although South Korean defense stocks bucked the trend amid President Trump's support for Ukraine. The article also notes the appointment of Anna Breman as the new governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and a higher-than-expected CPI rise in Australia, contributing to market jitters.

          <p>A Canadian investigation concluded that TikTok's measures to prevent underage use and protect children's personal data are inadequate. The probe found that hundreds of thousands of Canadian children use the app despite age restrictions and that TikTok collected sensitive information for online marketing and content targeting. While TikTok disputes some findings, it has agreed to implement new measures to strengthen its platform for Canadian users. This investigation is part of a broader global scrutiny of the Chinese-owned app regarding user impact and national security concerns, including in the US and Europe.</p>

The article emphasizes moving beyond a Western-centric view to understand the parade's importance within the unique historical and current realities of Hong Kong and Macau.

          <p>A frightening incident occurred during a Cleveland Guardians-Detroit Tigers game when Guardians player David Fry was struck in the face by a 99 mph fastball during a bunt attempt. The pitch deflected off his bat, causing immediate pain and visible blood from his nose, leading to his prompt removal from the game. Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal was visibly distraught by the event, throwing down his glove in shock. Despite the severity, the contact with the bat resulted in a foul ball, and the inning continued with a pinch-hitter, highlighting the unpredictable nature of baseball injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly altered his position on the war in Ukraine, now asserting that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO. This statement, made on Truth Social after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a departure from his previous suggestions of territorial concessions. Trump cited Russia's economic troubles as a factor, calling it a "paper tiger." Zelensky hailed this as a "big shift" and a positive signal, indicating an improved understanding with the US president regarding security guarantees.</p>

An investigation by NHS Resolution found the trust had not fulfilled all 10 safety measures, despite previously receiving rebates based on self-reported compliance. This follows a damning Care Quality Commission report that rated the trust's maternity services as inadequate, exposing women and babies to significant risk.

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, as major federal health agencies move to phase out live animal research in favor of alternatives. This shift is driven by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan lawmakers, aiming to reduce billions in federal spending on animal experiments. While animal testing has been crucial for developing many life-saving medications and vaccines, critics argue for more ethical and efficient methods like AI modeling and lab-grown human organs.

          <p>Medics at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City are overwhelmed by casualties from Israeli strikes, performing operations in unsanitary conditions with minimal anesthesia. An Australian volunteer described daily mass casualty events and a harrowing instance where a baby was saved from a decapitated pregnant woman. Israeli forces are advancing within 500m of the hospital as they expand their ground offensive into Gaza City, which the military designates as Hamas's main stronghold. The article highlights the dire humanitarian situation, with limited medical supplies, mass displacement, and soaring evacuation costs.</p>

          <p>Despite a lack of evidence, spurious allegations that fraud helped President Trump win the 2024 election, claiming Kamala Harris was the true victor, are flourishing online. Election experts draw parallels to the 2020 election fraud theories, noting similar flawed statistical analyses and reliance on innuendo. One popular theory, involving an alleged NSA audit and a former CIA officer, lacks credible proof and contradicts established election processes. The article emphasizes that such claims ignore real-world election safeguards and observer presence, highlighting the challenge of debunking persistent misinformation.</p>

          <p>California is moving to regulate excessively loud commercials on streaming services, with a bill awaiting the governor's signature. The legislation, inspired by a new parent's frustration over disruptive ads, would prohibit platforms like Hulu and Netflix from playing commercials louder than their programming. While federal law already regulates broadcast and cable TV ad volume, streaming services were exempt. The industry initially opposed the bill, citing control issues, but changed its stance after an amendment removed the right for private parties to sue, relying instead on regulatory enforcement.</p>

The article highlights recent examples of a clampdown on undeclared overseas income, with wealthy individuals forced to pay significant back taxes, signaling Beijing's intensified efforts to boost revenue. These measures are part of a broader strategy to secure cash for local authorities, which have historically relied on lax enforcement of tax laws. The upcoming plan is anticipated to outline high-level policy priorities for sustainable development and fiscal stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is rehiring hundreds of federal employees, primarily from the General Services Administration (GSA), who were laid off during a previous cost-cutting initiative led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. These employees, who managed government workspaces, are being asked to return after the GSA faced understaffing and high costs due to terminated or expired leases. Democrats have criticized the initial indiscriminate cuts for creating "costly confusion" and undermining essential services. The reversal reflects that the downsizing went "too far, too fast," prompting a reevaluation of federal workforce management.</p>

Jeremy Bowen reports on the shooting death of 19-year-old Abdullah, who was killed while waiting for food at a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site, protected by Israeli military and armed American security guards. The article highlights the famine gripping Gaza due to Israeli restrictions on supplies, which Israel denies. Data indicates a significant increase in Palestinian deaths at or around GHF sites, mostly from IDF fire, raising grave concerns about international humanitarian and human rights law violations.</p>

This approach aims to distinguish themselves from Labour and the Conservatives, hoping the prospect of a Farage premiership will energize their base. The party is also using Farage to highlight perceived disparities in media coverage. Despite Reform UK clarifying its stance on gun laws, the Lib Dems continue to challenge past remarks, reflecting a determination not to be overshadowed in an increasingly competitive political landscape.</p>

The plan, covering 3,500 hectares of reef and waters, is framed by China as an effort to protect biodiversity and meet conservation commitments. However, the Philippines has formally protested, viewing it as an encroachment on its exclusive economic zone, while the U.S. condemned it as a "coercive attempt."
