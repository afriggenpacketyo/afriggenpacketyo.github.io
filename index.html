            <p>A US congressional committee has labeled Chinese AI company DeepSeek a “profound threat” to US national security, urging Nvidia to disclose customer information and dealings with the startup. The report alleges DeepSeek's close ties to the Communist Party, claiming it unlawfully undermines US technological leadership and censors information under Chinese law. Research suggests the company funnels American user data back to China through infrastructure connected to China Mobile and integrates tracking tools from ByteDance and Tencent, all of which have ties to the Chinese military.</p>

            <p>A Florida man, Jeffrey O. Kennerk, was indicted in New Jersey after allegedly boarding an Amtrak train with multiple handguns, an AR-15 style rifle, and ammunition. Transit police discovered an unattended bag containing a handgun, rifle rounds, and bullets at Penn Station in Newark, later identifying Kennerk from camera footage. He was apprehended in Trenton before boarding another train, with a subsequent search revealing more weapons in his second suitcase.

            <p>The UK government has implemented a temporary ban on holidaymakers bringing in cheese and meat products from the EU to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease (FMD). This restriction follows an earlier ban on similar products from Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria due to rising FMD cases in those countries. The ban applies to products regardless of packaging and includes items like pork, beef, cheese, and yoghurt, with potential fines of up to £5,000 for violations. The last major FMD outbreak in the UK in 2001 led to the culling of millions of animals.</p>

            <p>A judge in Los Angeles is hearing arguments on whether Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life in prison for the 1989 killings of their parents, should be resentenced. The hearing will focus on evidence and witness testimonies, particularly regarding the brothers' conduct during their 30 years in prison, and will not be a retrial of their guilt. The brothers' lawyers argue the killings were acts of self-defense after years of abuse, while prosecutors maintain they meticulously planned the murders for financial gain.</p>

Williams stated that the expectation for the 2025 season is to "go win big."</p>

            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) maintained its annual revenue forecast after exceeding profit expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong demand for AI chips. TSMC's high-performance computing division, which includes AI and 5G applications, significantly boosted sales. Despite potential headwinds from US President Donald Trump's trade policies, including tariffs and export controls, TSMC has not observed any changes in customer behavior. The company continues to invest in overseas facilities to diversify its supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Fast fashion retailers Temu and Shein have warned US customers of upcoming price increases due to Donald Trump's new tariffs on Chinese imports. The companies will be affected by import levies and the cancellation of the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed duty-free imports for shipments under $800. In response, the retailers are cutting spending on US social media advertising. Some experts suggest that despite the price hikes, items from Temu and Shein may still be cheaper than those from rival retailers.</p>

            <p>China is shifting its retaliatory tactics in the trade war with the US, moving beyond tariffs on goods to target the American services sector. This includes widening export controls on rare-earth minerals and initiating antitrust probes into American companies like DuPont and Google. Beijing has also placed dozens of US businesses on an "unreliable entity" list, restricting their trade and investment in China. Additionally, Chinese airlines have been ordered to halt further deliveries of Boeing jets, escalating tensions between the two countries.</p>
