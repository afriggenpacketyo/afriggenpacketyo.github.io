          <p>Russia has entered the trade dispute between the United States and India, stating that New Delhi has the sovereign right to select its own trade partners. The Kremlin's intervention comes after the U.S. threatened India with significant tariffs for purchasing discounted Russian oil, an action the U.S. administration claims undermines sanctions. Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, India has substantially increased its Russian oil imports, becoming a leading buyer. This geopolitical spat highlights the complex economic alliances forming as Western nations attempt to isolate Moscow financially while countries like India prioritize their national energy needs.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is expanding its global presence by launching new flights from Seattle to London and Reykjavik, Iceland, beginning next May. This move follows the airline's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and signals a strategic push into the lucrative international travel market, which has shown more resilience than domestic demand. The carrier will use its Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners for the daily London route and a 737 MAX 8 for the seasonal Iceland service. In line with this expansion, the airline also unveiled a new livery for its Dreamliner fleet, inspired by the northern lights.</p>

          <p>Air quality alerts are active in ten U.S. states, from the Midwest to the East Coast, due to smoke from over 700 wildfires burning across Canada and the American West.

The resulting smoke is causing hazy skies and health concerns in major cities like Detroit and New York.

          <p>A new poll indicates that Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill leads Republican Jack Ciattarelli by six percentage points in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, a key contest viewed as a bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections. The survey shows Sherrill with 48% support to Ciattarelli's 42%, though a significant number of voters remain undecided. Affordability and taxes are the top issues for New Jersey voters, with Ciattarelli seen as stronger on taxes and Sherrill perceived as better for creating economic opportunities. The poll also reflects voter concern over the national political climate and its influence on state-level issues.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines the public and media controversies surrounding actress Sydney Sweeney, particularly her recent American Eagle denim advertisement and other commercial partnerships. The author argues that criticism of Sweeney's numerous brand deals, from luxury fashion to soap containing her bathwater, is often unwarranted and stems from a desire to police a successful woman's choices. The piece frames Sweeney's unapologetic commercial instincts as a masterful understanding of modern celebrity, contrasting it with the performative activism of other stars. Ultimately, it posits that Sweeney is simply giving the public what it wants: a glamorous, larger-than-life movie star.</p>

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" marks its 100th anniversary, this article explores its enduring relevance as a profound depiction of a midlife crisis. The narrative, which follows protagonist Clarissa Dalloway over a single day in London, masterfully intertwines past, present, and future to explore themes of regret, identity, and the paths not taken. Woolf herself began the novel at age 40, channeling her own experiences of middle age into the work. The article argues that the novel's stream-of-consciousness style and its protagonist's deep introspection on life's choices make it a foundational text for understanding this complex and transformative life stage.</p>

          <h2>Pfizer Raises Full-Year Profit Forecast Citing Cost Cuts and Strong Drug Sales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance, signaling confidence in its performance driven by significant cost-cutting measures and strong second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The pharmaceutical giant's revenue was boosted by better-than-expected sales of its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, as well as other key drugs. The updated outlook accounts for potential impacts from President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The positive report suggests Pfizer's strategy to navigate the post-pandemic market and an upcoming patent cliff is gaining traction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska was met with a hostile and vocal crowd during a town hall meeting in Lincoln. Attendees repeatedly booed and heckled the congressman as he attempted to defend President Donald Trump's major policy and tax bill passed in July. The audience expressed anger over the bill's changes to Medicaid and its tax provisions, shouting "Tax the Rich!" and "vote him out!" Flood argued that the bill provides a middle-class tax cut and supports the state's infrastructure, but he was largely drowned out by the raucous crowd, highlighting deep divisions over the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has informed a federal judge that much of the information in the Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury transcripts is already public knowledge. In a court filing supporting the unsealing of the documents, the DOJ noted that witness testimony largely covered details that were revealed during Maxwell's trial or in public statements. The government is not currently seeking to unseal grand jury exhibits but is considering its position. This development comes as part of the process to increase transparency in the high-profile cases of Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, though it suggests the transcripts may not contain major new revelations.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have Democratic state lawmakers arrested after more than 50 of them fled the state to block a vote on a controversial Republican redistricting plan. By leaving Texas, the Democrats denied the state legislature the quorum needed to conduct business, temporarily halting a plan that would likely give Republicans more congressional seats. This dramatic move escalates the political battle over voting rights and gerrymandering in Texas. In a separate event, over 40 Jewish-American protesters were arrested outside a Trump hotel in New York while demonstrating against the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm nearly £46 million over the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The collapse trapped the funds of approximately 300,000 investors. The FCA found that Woodford and his company made "unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions" by shifting the fund into illiquid assets, which prevented them from meeting withdrawal requests. Woodford has been banned from senior management roles, though he and his firm are appealing the FCA's decision, making the findings and penalties provisional for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA is accelerating its timeline to place a nuclear reactor on the Moon, aiming for deployment by 2030 as part of its broader ambition to establish a permanent human base. According to reports, the move is partly driven by geopolitical competition, with officials noting similar plans by China and Russia. A small nuclear reactor is seen by many scientists as the most reliable way to power a lunar settlement, as it can provide continuous energy during the Moon's two-week-long nights. However, the ambitious goal faces challenges, including recent NASA budget cuts and concerns that the plan is more politically than scientifically motivated.</p>

The ruling, however, only applies to the four school districts where families brought the lawsuit, leaving the law in effect for the rest of the state as students return to class. The judge assailed the law as an "obviously unconstitutional" part of a coordinated strategy to inject Christian doctrine into public schools. This legal battle is part of a wider push in Republican-led states to increase religion's presence in public education.</p>

          <p>A coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the Trump administration's termination of a $3 billion climate justice grant program. The lawsuit argues that canceling the program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act to help disadvantaged communities combat climate change and pollution, is unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. This is the first class-action lawsuit of its kind, seeking to force the reinstatement of the entire program rather than having each of the nearly 350 grant recipients sue individually.

A new wave of novelists who built their audiences on the platform are gaining mainstream attention, often writing sprawling social fiction that marks a return to a style popularized by authors like Jonathan Franzen.

With the three-month average for job gains falling to just 35,000, economists are raising concerns about the risk of a recession, though it is not yet the base case for most. The slowdown is attributed to factors including the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and business investment.

          <p>Despite decades of discussion, the United States remains significantly behind Europe and Asia in developing high-speed rail, with most projects plagued by regulatory hurdles, political opposition, and soaring costs. This article examines the state of passenger rail, using California's troubled Los Angeles-to-San Francisco project as a prime example of failure, where costs have tripled and timelines have stretched into the 2030s. However, there are some signs of potential progress, such as the privately-operated Brightline in Florida and its planned expansion to Las Vegas. These projects suggest a viable path forward may exist, but systemic obstacles to large-scale infrastructure remain.</p>
