          <p>Following three days of violent unrest in Ballymena and other towns in Northern Ireland, police are investigating what they are calling a 'racist' disorder. The violence, which resulted in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests, began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault. Chief Constable Jon Boutcher condemned the violence, emphasizing solidarity with diverse communities and warning of prosecutions for those involved. Outreach workers reported families hiding in their homes, fearing for their safety as rioters targeted their properties, while anti-racism protests took place peacefully in west Belfast, and police presence remained heavy in affected areas to prevent further escalations. The unrest highlights deep-seated tensions and the need for community support and justice. Optimism in the face of bigotry is not a given.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference in Los Angeles was disrupted when Democratic Senator Alex Padilla attempted to ask questions about immigration operations, leading to his forcible removal. Noem was discussing increasing immigration operations and criticizing California's leadership when Padilla interrupted, stating his identity and intent to ask questions before being escorted out, allegedly forced to the ground, and handcuffed. Padilla expressed concern over the administration's treatment of individuals, referencing the potential impact on farm workers and laborers. Spokespeople for Homeland Security claimed Padilla did not identify himself and resisted officers, while politicians have reacted strongly to the incident, with Governor Newsom condemning it as dictatorial and shameful.

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the remaining rape charge after a juror reported being threatened by another juror. The jury had previously found Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of the same charge against Kaja Sokola. Jurors expressed disappointment at not reaching a verdict on the third-degree sexual assault charge against Jessica Mann, with most favoring conviction but one juror remaining unconvinced. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg intends to retry the rape charge, emphasizing the power imbalance and the need to correct misconceptions about sexual assault, and Weinstein's team expressed disappointment and suggested juror misconduct. The retrial underscores the complexities of sexual assault cases and the pursuit of justice.</p>

          <p>Walmart heiress Christy Walton funded a full-page advertisement in the New York Times promoting the 'No Kings' protest against President Trump, scheduled for the same day as the Army's 250th Anniversary parade. The ad lists declarations honoring commitments to allies, defending against dictators, and supporting a healthy economy, emphasizing that the government is 'of the people, by the people, for the people.' Walmart distanced itself from the ad, stating that Ms. Walton does not serve on the board or play any role in decision-making. The protests are positioned as a response to the 'increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration.' The protests aim to reduce attention on the military parade, highlighting concerns about the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Senator Lindsey Graham is advocating for full funding of President Trump's border security plan, despite opposition from Senator Rand Paul, who proposes cutting the funding by more than half. Graham's plan includes billions for the border wall, increased ICE detention capacity, and more Border Patrol agents. Paul argues that the White House's funding request is excessive and that costs for the border wall could be significantly reduced. The Senate is working on its version of the House GOP's 'big, beautiful bill,' aiming to advance Trump's agenda on taxes, immigration, and the national debt through budget reconciliation, while some senators express frustration with the administration's approach to budgeting. The debate highlights the ongoing tensions between fiscal conservatism and the administration's priorities.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats and some Republicans are criticizing the multimillion-dollar cost of the Army's 250th anniversary parade, which President Trump has long sought to celebrate the military. The Army has allocated between $25 million and $45 million for the parade, which will include 6,700 troops, tanks, military vehicles, and aircraft. Critics argue that the money could be better spent on military families or medical defense research. The parade falls on Trump's 79th birthday, and the Army's Golden Knights will present him with an American flag, after which he'll administer the constitutional oath to Army enlistees. The event has sparked controversy over its cost and purpose.</p>

This contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration that aimed to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized the benefits of Chinese students for American schools and the country, advocating for their employment by American companies. His remarks suggest a shift towards a more welcoming approach to international students, emphasizing their potential contributions to the US economy and innovation.

          <p>Amid a US-China trade truce, negotiators in London reached a 'framework' agreement to activate the Geneva deal, raising hopes for immediate alleviation of the trade conflict, including a potential US commitment to revoke some tech embargoes in return for China's relaxation of rare earth export restrictions. The London negotiations followed a call between President Trump and President Xi, months into Trump's second term. China tightened its rare earth exports, displaying its ability to retaliate, which prompted Trump to talk to Xi, as the trade tussle escalated into a global supply chain crisis. The talks may have de-escalated tensions, but there is little room for optimism unless they spark a reorientation of Washington’s trade and foreign policy thinking.</p>

Avenatti, who previously represented Stormy Daniels, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and obstructing payroll tax collection. Judge Selna acknowledged Avenatti's good deeds but emphasized the severity of his crimes, ordering him to pay around $9 million in restitution to victims, including a mentally ill paraplegic man. The resentencing followed an appeal, with prosecutors seeking more than 13 years and Avenatti requesting just over three, and the judge's decision was influenced by a victim's testimony. The case highlights the consequences of betraying client trust and the pursuit of justice for victims of fraud.</p>

          <p>A growing wildfire in Oregon has destroyed multiple homes and prompted evacuation orders in the Columbia River Gorge area, serving as an early warning for the upcoming fire season. The Rowena fire has expanded to 3,500 acres and remains uncontained, leading to evacuation orders for hundreds of homes and temporary highway closures. Governor Kotek invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act, mobilizing resources to combat the blaze, which has destroyed about 20 homes and threatens nearly 2,200 structures. The wildfire highlights the increasing threat of wildfires in the US West due to dry conditions and warming temperatures, emphasizing the need for preparedness and prevention.

The governors described migrants as hard-working and safe residents, while Republicans pointed to high-profile cases where migrants committed violent crimes.

          <p>President Trump's attendance at a performance of 'Les Misérables' at the Kennedy Center highlights the political irony of a leader embracing a musical that critiques autocracy and champions the rights of protesters. Trump's presence at the performance, which doubled as a fundraiser, occurred amidst real-world protests against his administration's immigration policies. The author notes that Trump's love of Broadway shows and megamusicals, particularly those from the 1970s and 80s, is not surprising, given his history and the show's themes can be reinterpreted to fit various political narratives. The event underscores the complex relationship between art, politics, and interpretation.</p>

          <p>A widely used federal website, climate.gov, will no longer be updated after the Trump administration eliminated its entire staff, raising concerns about access to climate-related information. The website, operated by NOAA, received nearly one million visitors monthly and was a trusted source of climate data. The staff of 10, responsible for writing content and creating maps and graphics, have been terminated, leading to the cessation of new content publication. This decision is seen as an effort to suppress public conversation about climate change and its impacts on the US, as the site provided up-to-date information on weather patterns, drought conditions, and greenhouse gas emissions.

The Trump administration is employing a tool that allows the president to request Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds.
