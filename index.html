          <p>A dozen states have filed a lawsuit against President Trump and his administration, challenging the legality of the new tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. New York Attorney General Letitia James asserts that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily raise taxes through tariffs. The lawsuit argues that the president's actions are unconstitutional and harmful to state economies. This legal challenge follows a similar suit filed by small businesses, adding to the pressure on the administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the installation of a makeup studio next to the Pentagon press briefing room, raising eyebrows amidst cost-cutting measures. The project, costing several thousand dollars, was suggested by a former Fox News producer. Hegseth claims he does his own makeup and hasn't used the press room to brief reporters, but rather for his own TV appearances. This comes after reports that Hegseth shared sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat, which is currently under review by the Defense Department's acting inspector general.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack on civilians near Pahalgam in Kashmir, the Indian government has announced punitive actions against Pakistan, accusing it of supporting terrorist attacks. India has suspended its participation in an important water treaty, closed a key land border, and downgraded diplomatic ties. These actions reflect heightened tensions between the two countries following the massacre, which killed 26 people and has led to emotional scenes across India.</p>

          <p>The German government is considering allowing Syrian refugees to visit their home country for a limited time without losing their refugee status, aiming to facilitate voluntary returns. Under the proposal, Syrians could return for up to four weeks to assess conditions and decide whether to return permanently.
