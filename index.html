          <h2>Six Ways to Build Trust With Your Child</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dual-certified child life specialist and therapist suggests six daily practices for parents to cultivate trust with their children, emphasizing open communication and emotional modeling. The practices include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, and being honest about personal challenges. Instead of interrogating children, parents should model emotional awareness by sharing aspects of their own day. Incorporating real talk into family routines, like sharing highs and lows at dinner, and teaching coping strategies are also important. Trust is built through consistent, small moments of connection and vulnerability.</p>

          <p>Driven by hot and dry conditions, fast-moving wildfires have forced the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people in Manitoba, Canada, with states of emergency declared in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Aerial footage shows massive smoke plumes from the fires. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre has classified conditions in Saskatchewan as extreme, with the premier warning that the number of evacuees could climb. The forecast offers little promise of relief, as strong winds are expected to exacerbate the spread of the flames and smoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts for an estimated 22 million Americans, making the situation dire for both countries. Climate change is believed to be contributing to the increased likelihood of these extreme weather conditions.</p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming defense review will send a "message to Moscow" and address growing concerns about Russian aggression, including daily cyberattacks on UK military networks. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a "new era of threat" from Russia and other countries like China. As part of the review, the government will commit ¬£1.5 billion to build six new factories to produce munitions, aiming to strengthen the armed forces and create 1,800 new jobs. The war in Ukraine has exposed deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons, prompting the UK to boost its munitions production capacity.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark. The developers suggest potential applications in surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, though some critics question their practicality compared to existing night vision devices.</p>

Cars with higher accident rates often cost more to insure, emphasizing the importance of comparing insurance quotes and considering individual driving history when determining premiums.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator stated that President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum was not raised during recent bilateral talks with U.S. officials. Trump's announcement coincided with the fourth round of tariff negotiations between Japan and the United States. Japan will closely monitor the specific details of the measures and continue negotiations to reach an agreement, with Prime Minister Ishiba potentially meeting with Trump in mid-June. Japan also faces additional tariffs on automobiles and other sectors imposed by the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit challenging an executive order that cut federal funding to what President Trump described as "biased media". The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech by targeting NPR for its news coverage. Experts believe NPR has a strong case, as Trump's administration has been open about targeting media organizations it believes have reported negatively on the president. The outcome of the lawsuit could have significant implications for press freedom in the United States.</p>
