          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached an agreement to reset their relations after Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. The agreement was reached during a summit in London hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The discussions covered contentious issues such as youth mobility schemes and fishing rights. The deal includes reciprocal access to fishing waters, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership, signaling a new era of collaboration between the two entities, particularly in the face of global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the credit rating of the United States, amplifying concerns about the cost of President Trump's policies and the health of the U.S. economy. The downgrade, driven by worries over the fiscal deficit and rising debt costs, means that all three major rating agencies no longer give the U.S. their top credit rating. This news, coupled with a bill in Congress to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, has rattled financial markets, causing stocks to decline and Treasury bond yields to rise. Analysts suggest the downgrade could focus attention on fiscal spending and interest rates in other countries as well.</p>

A recent study by JLL found that young workers are in the office more often than other generations. These young professionals view the office as a launchpad for their careers, seeking in-person interaction to develop corporate norms and build relationships. They believe that being in the office provides invaluable opportunities for mentorship and guidance, which are difficult to replicate in remote settings.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pushing for a comprehensive trade and defense deal with South Korea, bundling negotiations on trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing into a single agreement. Trump's transactional approach to alliances has raised concerns about U.S. credibility and the perception of U.S. commitments among allies. While South Korea has indicated a willingness to discuss defense cost-sharing, experts warn that using the deployment of U.S. forces as leverage could damage long-term relationships and reframe the U.S. as an isolated superpower. One potential solution involves South Korea investing in its own military capabilities and purchasing more U.S. military equipment.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that a typical household's annual energy bill will fall by £129, a decrease of nearly 7%. This reduction would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. The price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, so total bills will still vary based on consumption.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed widespread child sexual assault in South Africa's illegal mines, where children are recruited for cheap labor or brought in specifically for sex. Miners described instances of adult miners sexually assaulting underage miners in exchange for gold or protection. Many of these children are trafficked from neighboring countries, their passports confiscated upon arrival. Mining researcher Makhotla Sefuli confirms that criminal gangs specifically target children for illegal mining, with some being recruited solely for sexual exploitation. The police and the Department of Social Development have not responded to requests for comment on the allegations.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism after stating that he does not need to buy rice due to receiving ample amounts from supporters, amid rising rice prices impacting households. Eto's comments occurred as his ministry considers measures to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has roughly doubled from last year due to a poor harvest. Eto later expressed regret for his remarks. Public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of soaring rice prices is high, with Prime Minister Ishiba's Cabinet experiencing record-low support.</p>

          <p>A researcher at Princeton University argues that China has already begun to surpass the United States in economic and technological power, marking the dawn of a "Chinese century." The author contends that President Trump's policies, including tariffs and cuts to research funding, are undermining American innovation and global influence. In contrast, China is investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies and leading global production in key industries. The article suggests that if current trends continue, China will dominate high-end manufacturing and become the world's pre-eminent technological and economic superpower.</p>
