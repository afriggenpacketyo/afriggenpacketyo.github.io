          <p>A man convicted of murdering his estranged wife's parents and sister 35 years ago is scheduled for execution in Florida. The execution, set for September 17, would be the state's 12th this year, a record number since the death penalty was restored in 1976. The man, David Pittman, was also convicted of arson for setting the family's home on fire after the stabbings. His appeals, which included claims of intellectual disability, have previously been denied by the state Supreme Court, though further legal challenges are expected.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has suspended all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza, pending a full review of its procedures. This decision follows social media posts from a far-right influencer who made unsubstantiated claims against a charity, HEAL Palestine, that recently brought 11 critically injured Gazan children to the U.S. for medical care. The move was praised by some Republicans but condemned by humanitarian organizations like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, who warn it will have a devastating impact on children needing lifesaving treatment unavailable in Gaza's collapsed medical system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Celine Song's new film, 'Materialists,' highlights its reflection of modern dating, where financial considerations are increasingly explicit. The movie features a matchmaker who treats romance like a market, appraising clients' value to find suitable partners, a pragmatic approach born from economic pressures. The author of the article argues that while cinemagoers may find this cynical, it accurately portrays a reality shaped by dating apps and wealth inequality, where financial stability has become a key factor in relationships. The piece suggests that societal changes, not just individual choices, are needed to separate love from financial necessity.</p>

          <p>Residents are fleeing Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood due to days of continuous Israeli bombardment, which the local municipality describes as a "catastrophic" situation. Amid the offensive, Israel has announced it will resume allowing aid agencies to bring tents into Gaza in preparation for a plan to forcibly displace a million people to camps in the south. Meanwhile, a general strike is underway in Israel to protest the government's occupation plan, with demonstrators arguing it endangers the lives of hostages still held by Hamas. The UN reports widespread malnutrition and displacement, with Gaza's health ministry stating over 61,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p>

          <p>The British horse racing industry has announced an unprecedented one-day strike on September 10, cancelling four scheduled race meetings. The protest is against a government proposal to increase the tax rate on betting on the sport, aligning it with the higher rate for online gaming. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) warns that this tax hike would have a "destructive impact" on the industry's precarious finances. An economic analysis predicts the change could lead to a £330 million loss in revenue and put nearly 3,000 jobs at risk in its first year alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Increased government scrutiny on Chinese businesses evading social insurance payments is expected to make hiring retirees more attractive, as companies are not required to make these contributions for them. This trend, highlighted by McDonald's recruitment of seniors, has sparked public debate about shrinking job opportunities for the record number of young university graduates entering the workforce. A new judicial interpretation effective next month will invalidate agreements to forgo social insurance, adding pressure on employers. Stricter enforcement aims to address China's growing pension crisis by ensuring adequate funding for social security programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An author reflects on her evolving relationship with Renaissance art, noting that life experiences like trauma and motherhood allowed her to connect with its emotional depth. Initially, she dismissed classic works like Piero della Francesca's 'Madonna del Parto' as unrelatable, preferring contemporary art. However, major life events caused her to see the profound human stories of rage, grief, and love depicted in works by artists like Caravaggio and Michelangelo. This personal journey is framed by a visit to a Jenny Saville exhibition, which draws heavily on Renaissance themes of motherhood and suffering, making historical art feel intensely relevant.</p>

The government cited economic risks, including U.S. tariffs, as a reason for the swift action.

The technique produces highly accurate and vivid 3D images by preserving the organ's structural integrity while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. According to the scientists, the process prepares an "ionic glassy tissue" that is exceptionally clear. This glassy solid state can also be maintained at low temperatures, allowing for long-term storage of the prepared samples without degradation, which could advance neuroscientific studies.</p>
