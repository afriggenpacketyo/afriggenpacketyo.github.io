          <p>President Trump is sending 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles following clashes between residents and ICE agents in a predominantly Latino district, where 118 arrests were made this week due to ICE operations. California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized the raids as cruel, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused ICE of sowing terror, prompting a response from the FBI and Homeland Security chiefs who said the mayor's comments endangered federal agents. Trump has cited the need to halt the invasion of illegal criminals and blamed California's Democrat leaders for abdicating their responsibility to protect citizens, while Newsom countered that the federal government's actions are inflammatory and escalate tensions. The situation remains tense as authorities work to manage the unrest and ensure safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing a demographic crisis. The research, co-authored by academics from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield significantly higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, which threatens its economic stability and ability to catch up to developed nations. Traditional expectations that place the burden on women for childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

However, subsequent research from multiple teams, including Arizona State University and the University of Chicago, has challenged the original findings, citing noisy data and alternative explanations for the presence of the identified molecules. While the initial study reached a three-sigma level of significance, the scientific community emphasizes the need for a five-sigma threshold for a definitive discovery.

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some venture capitalists argue that overwork is necessary to compete globally, many founders and VCs believe that it leads to burnout and decreased retention. They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, work-life balance, and access to funding and resources rather than simply increasing working hours. The European tech scene has produced successful companies without relying on overwork, and younger generations are less tolerant of toxic hustle cultures.</p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai argues for a paradigm shift in how we approach artificial intelligence, suggesting that we should "parent" these systems as if they were our children. De Kai, a pioneer in machine learning and AI ethics, believes that since AI learns by absorbing everything we do and say online, we need to be conscientious about our behavior around our AI "children." He emphasizes the need to be good role models and advocates for responsible AI development to avoid societal demise. This approach calls for a shift in perspective from viewing AI as a technological arms race to recognizing it as a change to the social climate that humanity is competing in.</p>
