          <p>The New York Islanders have chosen 17-year-old defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the first overall pick in the 2025 NHL draft. Schaefer, who played for the Erie Otters in the OHL, is the first defenseman selected at number one since 2021. His selection comes after a challenging year where he recovered from a broken collarbone and dealt with significant personal loss, including the death of his mother. During the draft event, an emotional Schaefer honored his mother's memory by kissing a breast cancer awareness patch on his new Islanders jersey.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has initiated a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, falsely claimed Newsom lied about a phone conversation with President Donald Trump regarding protests in Los Angeles. Newsom's legal team stated the suit would be dropped in exchange for a retraction and an on-air apology from Watters. Fox News has dismissed the lawsuit as a "frivolous publicity stunt" and has vowed to defend itself vigorously against the allegations.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent details a project at the University of Southampton that investigates bacteriophages—viruses that prey on bacteria—as a potential weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The journalist successfully collected a phage sample from his home toilet that proved effective in a lab setting at killing bacteria from a patient with a recurring urinary tract infection. This century-old field of phage therapy is gaining renewed interest as the global threat of antimicrobial resistance grows, with projections estimating 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Researchers believe phages could become a viable alternative to antibiotics for treating certain infections.</p>

          <p>According to an annual trade report from the Japanese government, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports has surged to 25.9%, a level not seen since the Great Depression era. The report highlights that measures under President Donald Trump, including levies on Chinese goods reaching 145%, are of a "historic scale." The Japanese trade ministry expressed concern that the frequent and significant changes in U.S. trade policy are creating a climate of "heightened uncertainty" for the global economy.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued the request to prevent disinformation and defamation targeting political candidates.

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked an executive order from President Trump that targeted a prominent law firm, in this case, Susman Godfrey. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan declared the order unconstitutional, following similar decisions in cases brought by three other firms. These executive orders sought to punish firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. The series of judicial rebukes represents a significant defense of the legal profession's independence and the right to counsel against executive overreach.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a major policy reversal, backing down from planned cuts to disability benefits after facing a significant rebellion from its own MPs. The proposed changes, intended to generate short-term savings to meet fiscal rules, were criticized for targeting vulnerable individuals without a comprehensive long-term reform plan. This U-turn has created a potential £3 billion hole in the budget, forcing the Chancellor to consider tax rises or other spending cuts. The episode has raised significant questions about the government's ability to manage its agenda and the credibility of its overall economic strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against a war powers resolution that aimed to require President Trump to seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran. The measure, introduced by Senator Tim Kaine, failed in a 47-53 vote, reflecting a deep partisan divide on executive authority in foreign conflicts. The vote occurred amid Democratic frustration over what they describe as a lack of transparency from the administration regarding recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Some Democrats have questioned the administration's claims about the extent of the damage and the imminence of the threat that prompted the military action.</p>

Industry unions and professionals have applauded the move, arguing it is a critical step to support the state's economy and bring jobs back to California.

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block executive branch policies, a significant victory for the Trump administration. The ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, but the court did not decide on the order's constitutionality. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that lower courts should only provide relief to the specific plaintiffs in a case. In a strong dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the decision weakens judicial checks on executive power and renders constitutional guarantees "meaningful in name only."</p>

          <p>A commentary article argues that the Supreme Court's decision to curtail nationwide injunctions in the birthright citizenship case represents a dramatic expansion of presidential power. The ruling effectively allows the executive branch to implement potentially unconstitutional orders, with legal challenges limited to specific plaintiffs and jurisdictions, creating a chaotic patchwork of rights. The author contends this move gives the president unchecked authority to defy the constitution at will, forcing individuals to seek narrow court orders for protection.

These fiscally conservative Republicans are challenging their own party's leadership, arguing that the math on recent bills "doesn't really add up" and demanding more discipline. This creates an internal GOP conflict, pitting deficit hawks against a party leadership focused on passing legislation, even at the cost of increasing the national deficit.
