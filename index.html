          <h2>Five-Day Strike by English Doctors to Proceed After Talks Fail</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:50:41 EDT</div>

          <p>A planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England will commence as scheduled after negotiations between the British Medical Association (BMA) and the government failed to produce a resolution. The BMA rejected the government's offer, which focused on non-pay issues like working conditions, stating that the core of the dispute remains the demand for pay restoration to 2008 levels. Health Secretary Wes Streeting criticized the decision as reckless, while the union maintained that the government's proposal was insufficient to address the scale of the challenges doctors face. The strike is expected to cause significant disruption to non-urgent care within the NHS.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested a meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein, to question her about her knowledge of his activities. The move, announced by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, follows weeks of public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information related to the Epstein case. Maxwell's legal team has confirmed they are in discussions with the government and stated that she would testify truthfully. This development occurs as Maxwell is appealing her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a reshuffle of her senior team, appointing former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. In this prominent role, Cleverly will directly challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. The shake-up also includes several other changes, such as Stuart Andrew moving to the health brief, and is described by the party as reflecting a new stage in its policy renewal program. The reshuffle aims to unify the party and present a stronger opposition to the Labour government.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the House of Representatives will start its August recess early, a move that prevents votes on Democratic-backed motions concerning the Jeffrey Epstein files. Johnson characterized the efforts to force votes on releasing Justice Department investigative files as "political games," asserting that Congress should not push an administration to do something it is already doing. Consequently, votes scheduled for Thursday were canceled, and the month-long recess will begin Wednesday afternoon. The decision comes amid controversy over the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell case files.</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero after saving his four-year-old child by pulling them from the jaws of a mountain lion during a hike in Washington's Olympic National Park. The attack occurred on a well-traveled trail, and the child was subsequently airlifted to a trauma center and has since been discharged. Park rangers later located and euthanized the animal, which had been fitted with a GPS collar. Officials emphasized that such attacks are extremely rare, with only two recorded fatalities from mountain lions in Washington over the past century.</p>

          <p>The estate of deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his former business partner have been ordered by the High Court to pay £700 million to Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). The ruling concludes a long-running legal dispute stemming from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's software company, Autonomy. HPE successfully argued that Lynch and Autonomy's former CFO had fraudulently inflated the company's value, leading HPE to overpay significantly. The judgment was delayed following Lynch's death in a yachting accident last year.</p>

The article argues that both views miss the larger trend: the fragmentation of media consumption. In an era of streaming and niche audiences, the broad, unifying appeal of past late-night hosts is no longer financially viable, making Colbert's departure a symptom of a permanent cultural shift.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the concept of credit card grace periods for consumers. It distinguishes between the grace period on new purchases, which allows users to avoid interest by paying their balance in full each month, and the common misconception of a grace period for late payments. Most credit card issuers do not offer a formal grace period after a due date has passed, meaning late fees and penalty APRs can be applied immediately. The article advises consumers who may miss a payment to contact their card company proactively, as some may offer informal leeway, especially for customers with a good payment history.</p>

          <p>Singer Billy Joel recently spoke about his diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition that led him to cancel his tour two months ago. He described one of the primary symptoms as a constant feeling of poor balance, likening it to "being on a boat." The 76-year-old musician reassured fans that while the condition is still being treated, he feels good and that the diagnosis sounds worse than his actual physical state. Normal pressure hydrocephalus involves a buildup of fluid in the brain and is more common in people over 65.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people who allege they were victims of abuse by the late Mohamed Al Fayed have applied to a compensation scheme established by Harrods. The luxury department store, which Fayed formerly owned, confirmed the number of applicants and announced the scheme's eligibility has been extended to include employees of one of Fayed's private airline companies. Multiple women have accused Fayed of sexual assault, and the compensation scheme, which remains open until 2026, represents an effort to provide redress for victims following a BBC investigation into the allegations.</p>

          <p>Former national park superintendents are warning that significant budget and staffing cuts under the Trump administration are "hollowing out" America's public lands. While visitor-facing services like clean toilets might be maintained, crucial behind-the-scenes work is being neglected. This includes the monitoring of endangered species, tracking invasive plants, and other scientific research essential for long-term resource preservation. Experts caution that these cuts, while not immediately obvious to tourists, will have severe, long-term consequences for the health and integrity of the nation's most treasured natural and historical sites.</p>

          <p>An expedition surveying WWII shipwrecks in the Solomon Islands has discovered remarkably well-preserved artifacts from the USS DeHaven, an American destroyer sunk in 1943. Using remotely operated vehicles, the Ocean Exploration Trust captured high-resolution footage of the wreckage, identifying intact torpedoes, artillery, and the ship's bell on the seabed. The DeHaven sank with 167 crew members on board during the Guadalcanal campaign. This new data provides an invaluable historical record and will aid in the management of this underwater heritage site.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released 230,000 pages of previously classified government records related to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The files, which include details of the FBI's extensive surveillance and disinformation campaigns against the civil rights leader, had been sealed by a court order since 1977. King's surviving children issued a statement condemning the historical government targeting of their father and urged the public to view the files within that context. The release has drawn criticism for its timing, seen by some as a distraction from controversies surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>English football club Crystal Palace has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against UEFA's decision to demote them from the Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League. The punishment was issued due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor has stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. If the punishment is upheld, Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest are expected to take Palace's spot. The club argues that Textor does not hold decisive influence and is hopeful the decision will be overturned.</p>

The original 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs was put in place to allow for negotiations. Bessent expressed optimism that the talks could also address other issues, such as China's manufacturing glut and its purchases of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, Donald Trump's border czar, has declared that sanctuary cities are a new priority for the administration and vowed to "flood the zone" with ICE agents to overcome non-cooperation from local authorities.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blamed the policies of Democrat-run cities for endangering the public.

CEO James Quincey clarified that the new offering will complement the existing portfolio rather than replace it, describing it as an "and" strategy, not an "or" strategy.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic posits that President Donald Trump's persistent attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are not about economic competence but about a fundamental objection to the Fed's independence. The article argues that Trump's stance on interest rates has consistently shifted based on which party holds the presidency, demanding low rates for Republicans and high rates for Democrats. This behavior suggests a belief that the central bank's purpose should be to serve short-term partisan goals rather than to steward the long-term health of the U.S. economy.
