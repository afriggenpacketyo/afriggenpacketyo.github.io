          <p>Liberal Party leader Mark Carney has secured a victory in Canada's recent election, marking a decade of Liberal leadership and succeeding Justin Trudeau. The election outcome remains uncertain, with the Liberals potentially forming a minority government. Amidst the election, Donald Trump made a social media post suggesting Canada should become the 51st state if Canadians voted for him, prompting responses from Canadian political figures, with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre telling Trump to stay out of Canada's election. Carney emphasized Canada's sovereignty in response to Trump's remarks.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that individual investors are maintaining their positions during recent market volatility due to their confidence in President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Bessent cited data indicating that a vast majority of Americans haven't made trades recently, contrasting this with institutional investors who have reportedly panicked. This comes as Trump's tariffs have contributed to market instability, with some economists predicting a potential recession due to trade-related shortages. Ken Griffin of Citadel also expressed concerns that Trump's trade policies could damage the U.S.'s reputation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced an expansion of its cost-cutting measures, projecting an additional $1.2 billion in savings by the end of 2027, primarily in selling, informational, and administrative expenses, driven by automation and AI. This move aims to offset declining sales, largely due to reduced revenue from its COVID-19 antiviral pill, Paxlovid. The company also anticipates $500 million in R&D reorganization savings by 2026, which will be reinvested into its product pipeline. Pfizer's first-quarter profits exceeded expectations, indicating the cost-cutting efforts are beginning to yield positive results.</p>

          <p>The White House has condemned Amazon's reported plan to show the cost of President Donald Trump's tariffs alongside product prices, labeling it a "hostile and political act." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon didn't take similar action during the Biden administration when inflation was high.

While the 25% tariff on auto parts is still scheduled to take effect, reimbursements will be available, amounting to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car in the first year, decreasing to 2.5% in the second year, and then being phased out entirely.

Poilievre, who had been seen as a potential prime minister, conceded defeat and expressed commitment to continue fighting for his supporters. The shift in opinions favoring Carney over Poilievre came as President Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and made remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that common chemicals found in everyday plastic products may be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific. The study estimates that exposure to phthalates, chemicals used to increase the durability and flexibility of plastics, could have contributed to 350,000 deaths in 2018. Researchers caution against drawing definitive conclusions about causation, but suggest that reducing exposure to these chemicals may lower the risk of CVD. The study recommends avoiding microwaving and dishwashing plastics as precautionary measures.</p>

          <p>The increasing prevalence of AI-generated text is subtly reshaping human communication, potentially leading to a "great language flattening." While some fear that AI will make human language terse, experiments suggest that exposure to AI text may lead to more verbose writing. Linguists speculate that AI could standardize English, homogenizing writing styles and diminishing cultural nuances. However, a countermovement may emerge, with individuals deliberately embracing linguistic idiosyncrasies to differentiate themselves from AI-generated content.</p>

          <p>A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments has filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal government, arguing that it violates the Constitution. The lawsuit claims that actions taken by President Trump, Elon Musk, and federal agency heads to downsize the federal workforce exceed their authority without congressional authorization. The plaintiffs argue that Congress, not the President, has the sole authority to undertake such a transformation of federal agencies. The lawsuit targets Musk's DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) team, asserting it has no authority to dictate staffing cuts or spending reductions.</p>

Leading CDs provide returns exceeding the current inflation rate and allow you to lock in high rates for the CD's term. While national average CD rates vary by term, top CDs from online banks often offer more competitive rates. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include exploring online banks and considering short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve.
