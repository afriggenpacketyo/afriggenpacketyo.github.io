          <p>A violent series of events in Lexington, Kentucky, culminated in a fatal church shooting that left two parishioners and the suspect dead. The incident began when the gunman shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop near the Blue Grass Airport. After carjacking a vehicle, the suspect fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church, where he killed two women, identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32, and wounded two other men. The deadly episode concluded when Lexington police officers confronted and fatally shot the suspect at the church.</p>

          <p>Emergency search operations for victims of catastrophic July 4th flooding in Kerr County, Texas, were suspended due to a new flood threat. Heavy rains prompted fresh warnings as the Guadalupe and San Saba Rivers were forecast to rise dangerously, threatening areas still reeling from the initial disaster. The original floods killed at least 129 people statewide, with 161 individuals from the Hill Country still reported as missing. Authorities have initiated new rescue operations and evacuations in several counties as the severe weather continues to pose a life-threatening risk to residents and recovery crews.</p>

          <p>A volatile wildfire in Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire expanded to 5,000 acres, also burning a water treatment facility and causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighter evacuations. While no casualties have been reported from the fire, smoke from this and other Canadian wildfires is causing unhealthy air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest. This event is part of a broader pattern of dangerous weather, including extreme heat, that has prompted multiple warnings and closures in the region.</p>

          <p>Supermodel Heidi Klum recently shared videos on Instagram from a tropical vacation with her husband, Tom Kaulitz. The posts show the couple embracing on a beach, with Klum captioning one, "another day in paradise for you and me." The article also revisits Klum's previous comments about the 16-year age gap between her and Kaulitz, whom she married in 2019. She has addressed the public criticism, suggesting it stems from spitefulness and age-shaming, and emphasized that she lives in the present with her husband rather than worrying about future perceptions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a key series victory against the San Francisco Giants, winning 5-2 in 11 innings. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was exceptional, pitching seven scoreless innings and concluding a stellar first half of the season. However, the team's bullpen struggles continued as closer Tanner Scott gave up a two-run homer in the ninth, blowing the initial lead. Despite inconsistent offensive performances from some veterans, the Dodgers managed to rally in the 11th inning, entering the All-Star break with a comfortable lead in the National League West.</p>

Trump and the First Lady will be hosted at Windsor Castle, making him the first modern politician to be granted two state visits.

Critics questioned the logic, noting the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit.

Cramer posits that Trump's policies, including deregulation and pro-business tax changes, are creating a positive environment for corporate profits and stock prices, even if his methods are controversial.

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Senator Rand Paul stated that the shooter's motive remains unclear and likely will never be known. Paul, who chairs the Senate committee that investigated the incident, told "Face the Nation" that he believes authorities have tried their best but have not found a definitive answer. His comments followed the release of his committee's report, which detailed "inexcusable negligence" by the Secret Service. The report highlighted numerous security lapses, such as failing to act on warnings about a man on a roof minutes before the shooting.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. In a social media post, Trump urged his base not to "waste time and energy" on the issue and to let Bondi do her job. The backlash stems from a recent Justice Department memo which stated there was no "incriminating client list," a finding that disappointed many who expected major revelations. The controversy has highlighted a growing rift between some conservative figures and the administration over the case.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album titled "Swag," which critics are describing as a raw, quirky, and authentic R&B record. The album moves away from polished pop, featuring murky production and improvisational-feeling tracks that reflect a more turbulent period in the singer's life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee and Dijon, Bieber embraces a messier, more idiosyncratic sound that aligns with modern pop trends. The album is seen as a sincere artistic reset, showcasing his vocal talents over spacey, chillwave-inspired grooves and offering a frank look at his personal challenges and growth.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have launched a significant new offensive on el-Fasher, the last army-controlled city in Darfur. During a fierce battle, RSF fighters managed to take control of the city's main cattle market and briefly held a prison before being pushed back by the army. The attack is part of an ongoing siege that has turned the city into a "death trap," with residents facing constant shelling and starvation. The conflict has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with millions displaced and a looming famine in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 in a London hospital after a period of illness. Buhari was a polarizing figure, first leading Nigeria as an authoritarian military head of state in the 1980s before returning to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was marked by huge expectations to tackle corruption and insecurity, but was ultimately defined by economic decline and spreading violence. Despite a fraught legacy, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north.</p>
