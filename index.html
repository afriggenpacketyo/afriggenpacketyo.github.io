          <p>Minnesota Republican lawmakers plan to introduce a bill that would add "Trump derangement syndrome" to the state's definition of mental illness.  The proposed legislation defines the syndrome as an acute onset of paranoia in response to President Trump's policies and presidency. Due to a split legislature, the bill's passage is unlikely.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering significant changes to its welfare system, focusing on reducing the cost of health-related benefits and incentivizing work.  Data analysis reveals a link between rising mental health issues and benefit claims, raising questions about whether welfare cuts could inadvertently increase unemployment.  The government aims to "bend the curve" of rising benefit costs, but this may trigger backlash from disability charities and Labour MPs.</p>
