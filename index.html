          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has declared President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional, stating it violates the 14th Amendment. The 9th Circuit panel's decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy, which sought to deny automatic citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. The White House has vowed to appeal the ruling, arguing the court misinterpreted the amendment's text. This ruling upholds a nationwide injunction against the policy, continuing the complex legal battle over its implementation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new trade policy establishes a baseline tariff of at least 15% on foreign goods, which economists warn will likely lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. Companies such as Nestlé and General Electric have already indicated they may raise prices to offset the increased costs from these duties. While the White House argues that foreign exporters will bear the cost, analyses suggest a gradual but significant impact on consumer prices for imported goods like electronics and apparel.

          <p>Legendary football coach Nick Saban has effectively put an end to speculation about his potential return to the sidelines, stating he is happy with his current life. In a recent interview, he humorously remarked that the only time he considered returning to coaching was when his wife asked him to do household chores. Saban emphasized his enjoyment of his new role working with athletic directors and commissioners, as well as spending more time with his family, indicating no immediate plans to unretire.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order on homelessness that has sparked both outrage and cautious optimism. The order directs federal agencies to support encampment removal and prioritize civil commitment for individuals with mental illness, a shift away from 'housing first' policies. Homeless advocates have condemned the measure as a punitive step toward criminalization, while some local officials, like L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, see a potential for much-needed funding, despite concerns about the order's harsh tone and approach.</p>

The move replaces a previous FEMA program that provided funds for sheltering migrants and comes amid a broader redefinition of the agency's mission under the current administration.</p>
