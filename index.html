          <h2>Kilmar Abrego Garcia Returns to U.S. to Face Human Smuggling Charges After Erroneous Deportation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 20:53:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in an alien smuggling ring, transporting migrants from Latin America through Mexico to the U.S., and that he and his co-conspirators devised cover stories for law enforcement. His attorney argues that the charges are an abuse of power, especially considering Abrego Garcia's initial deportation was an administrative error, and that the government is trying to portray him as the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy despite him being a sheet metal worker. If convicted, Abrego Garcia would serve his sentence in the U.S. before being returned to El Salvador. Optimism here is a reflection of the fact that the Supreme Court ensured the defendant has his day in court.</p>

          <p>Multiple immigration enforcement operations by Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI across Los Angeles led to dozens of arrests and citywide protests. ICE reported approximately 44 people were arrested, with a grand jury indictment filed in May. The raids occurred in the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., causing anxiety among Angelenos. City officials, including Mayor Karen Bass and Senator Alex Padilla, condemned the operations, stating that they sow terror in communities and disrupt basic principles of safety. Community leaders and activists gathered for a press conference, emphasizing the need to stop immigration enforcement that terrorizes families.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly discussed the possibility of creating a new political party in America, potentially escalating his conflict with former ally President Trump. Musk initiated a poll on X, asking his followers if a new party representing the "80% in the middle" was needed, and later endorsed the name "America Party." Starting a new party faces challenges, including ballot access and campaign finance regulations. While Musk's seriousness is unclear, this move could signal his intent to remain politically engaged and challenge Trump's influence.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public feud with President Trump, which sent Tesla shares plummeting. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to a social media brawl and threats of revoked government contracts. This has jeopardized a relationship that blended business, politics, and power, potentially impacting Tesla's future regulations and government support. Additionally, Tesla faces internal issues such as increased competition, consumer backlash, and quality problems, leading to lowered growth expectations. The board is being called upon to ensure Tesla's stability regardless of Musk's actions.</p>

          <p>The government is struggling to reduce the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with the Home Office planning to spend ¬£2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the ¬£2.3bn spent in 2024/25. Foreign aid is supposed to be used to alleviate poverty overseas, but international rules allow some of it to be spent on asylum seekers during their first year. The scale of this spending has led to significant cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world.</p>
