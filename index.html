          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum anticipates the deportation of boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. from the U.S. to face charges of arms and drug trafficking. Chávez Jr. was arrested by ICE in Los Angeles for being in the country illegally and has a history of U.S. convictions, including for a DUI and illegal possession of an assault weapon. U.S. authorities also allege he is an affiliate of the Sinaloa Cartel, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. The case has drawn attention to immigration enforcement policies and national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims, but instead introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction for seniors. The deduction, worth up to $6,000 for individuals, is aimed at those aged 65 and older with incomes below certain thresholds. Policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not alter the fundamental taxation of Social Security. Critics also warn it could increase financial pressure on the program's already strained trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the location of a major explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California. Seven people who were believed to be at the facility remain unaccounted for following the incident, which destroyed multiple structures and sparked an 80-acre grass fire. Investigations have revealed that the company lacked local permits to store fireworks on the agricultural property. A county sheriff's lieutenant reportedly owns and lives on the property, though he is not involved in the investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The ruling lifts a lower court's injunction that had required the government to provide notice and a chance for the migrants to contest their removal over safety fears. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sotomayor expressed grave concerns that the men could face torture or death in South Sudan. The decision is a significant development in the administration's policy of deporting individuals to third-party countries.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire in Central California has rapidly grown to over 70,800 acres, establishing it as the largest wildfire in the state so far this year. Originating in the Los Padres National Forest, the blaze was only 10% contained as of Friday and has threatened approximately 50 structures, prompting evacuations in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. Officials have deployed extensive air and ground resources to combat the fire, which has seen exponential growth due to weather and terrain conditions. The cause of the fire remains under investigation by Cal Fire and its partners.</p>

Some experts and employees now argue that emotional intelligence is a strength and that supportive environments foster better productivity. However, others caution that a bias against showing emotion still exists in some organizations and could potentially affect career advancement. The consensus suggests that while a single instance is unlikely to be career-damaging, perceptions vary widely.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that tiny zooplankton in the Southern Ocean play a surprisingly large role in combating global warming by locking away vast amounts of carbon. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then migrate deep into the ocean for winter, where they burn this fat and release the carbon. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, prevents the carbon from re-entering the atmosphere for centuries. The study quantifies this effect as equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million gasoline-powered cars, highlighting the overlooked importance of these small organisms.</p>

This is because they benefit from lower federal rates and other provisions without being negatively impacted by the bill's cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions.

Thomas Rogers, 35, was first charged with simple assault in Manchester after an incident involving a woman he knows. After being released on bail with orders not to return to the residence, he was arrested there a second time just hours later. He now faces additional charges of breach of bail and stalking, and is being held in jail pending further legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration policies and a new budget bill that significantly increases enforcement funding. The rally, which marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, highlighted the fear and disruption caused by recent, aggressive U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across the Southland. Protesters, including local activists and politicians, condemned the spending package and the deployment of the National Guard, arguing that the actions terrorize communities and undermine American values of freedom and independence.</p>

          <p>Germany began their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory against Poland, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. Gwinn, who has a history of two prior ACL tears, left the pitch in tears during the first half, casting doubt on her future participation in the tournament. Goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller secured the three points for the eight-time champions. While the performance was a solid start, the team and its supporters now face an anxious wait for medical tests to determine the severity of their captain's injury.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a dramatic five-run victory over India in a last-ball thriller at The Oval, keeping the T20 series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs from the final ball but were denied, ending their innings at 166-5. England's win was anchored by half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, who built a massive opening partnership. However, a stunning collapse saw England lose nine wickets for just 31 runs. A crucial, high-pace bowling spell from Lauren Filer then turned the game back in England's favor during India's chase.</p>

Burns stressed that America is held together by ideas and words, like those in the Declaration of Independence, which remain inspirational and require citizens to engage in a continuous process of learning and participation.</p>

The aggressive innings, part of a 303-run partnership with Harry Brook, showcased the power and attacking style that the England leadership has sought. This performance has drawn comparisons to Australian legend Adam Gilchrist and solidified Smith's place in the team. Still only 24, Smith's rapid ascent and immense talent suggest he could become one of England's greatest-ever wicketkeeper-batters if he continues on his current trajectory.</p>
