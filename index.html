          <p>Metropolitan Police have issued a direct appeal for Hadush Kebatu, a migrant sexual offender, to hand himself in following his mistaken release from an Essex prison. Kebatu was jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping and has since traveled across London, accessing funds and seeking public assistance. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy has ordered an independent investigation into the significant error, prompting new prison procedures for release checks to prevent future incidents. Authorities are pursuing all leads to locate Kebatu safely, emphasizing the critical public protection concerns surrounding his disappearance.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that practical savings, such as buying household consumables in bulk, can be a more effective "investment" than attempting to pick stocks. He highlights that saving 40% on typical annual household spending could yield significant returns. Cuban also emphasizes avoiding credit card debt for purchases that cannot be immediately paid off, advocating for cash transactions. This article presents his philosophy that smart money moves often involve simple, everyday habits rather than complex financial strategies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, a ballot initiative to redraw congressional districts, is gaining significant support by being framed as a direct response to Donald Trump and Republican gerrymandering. Governor Gavin Newsom and national Democrats advocate the measure as a way to "fight fire with fire," counteracting Republican efforts in states like Texas. Despite mixed feelings about abandoning non-partisan maps, polls indicate a strong "yes" vote, largely driven by voter opposition to Trump.
