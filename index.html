          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an unprecedented performance, both pitching and hitting, to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series. Ohtani blasted three home runs and pitched six scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts in the decisive game, silencing critics who questioned his recent hitting slump. This extraordinary display, including the first leadoff homer by a pitcher in baseball history, propelled the Dodgers to their second consecutive World Series appearance. The team now aims to become the first back-to-back champions in 25 years.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a new computing pooling solution that reportedly cut the number of Nvidia GPUs needed for its artificial intelligence models by 82%. Beta-tested for over three months, the system reduced GPU usage from 1,192 to 213 for dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters. This innovation addresses resource inefficiency in serving concurrent large language model (LLM) workloads, where many GPUs are underutilized. The development by Alibaba Cloud and Peking University researchers aims to improve efficiency for cloud service providers managing thousands of AI models.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has set a deadline of June 1, 2026, for prosecutors to retry Pedro Hernandez, who was previously convicted of the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz. If jury selection does not commence by this date, Hernandez will be released, and he may also seek bail before then. This marks potentially Hernandez's third trial in the decades-old cold case, after his first trial ended in a hung jury and his second conviction was overturned due to incorrect jury instructions. Hernandez's attorneys maintain his confession was false, citing his mental illness.</p>

          <p>At least 15 individuals were detained following confrontations between Illinois state police and protesters outside the Broadview ICE detention center in the Chicago area. Tensions escalated when officers moved to clear roadways after demonstrators reportedly violated designated "protest zones." Videos captured officers tackling and dragging individuals, while protesters chanted "Who do you protect?" Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized the deployment of federal forces, praising a recent court order requiring federal agents to wear body cameras during immigration operations due to previous incidents involving chemical agents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate commutation of former Republican congressman George Santos' seven-year federal prison sentence for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Trump stated Santos, whom he called "somewhat of a 'rogue,'" had been "horribly mistreated" in solitary confinement and consistently voted Republican. The clemency grant frees Santos from further fines, restitution, or supervised release, just three months into his term. The decision, influenced by a public plea from Santos and advocacy from Republican allies, drew criticism from some GOP and Democratic lawmakers who felt it was not justice.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under the Trump administration, has terminated a consent order that prohibited Citibank from discriminating against its Armenian American customers. The order, which mandated over $24.5 million in penalties and redress, was ended three years early, with the agency stating Citibank had taken steps to prevent future violations. Citibank had been accused of applying stricter criteria or blocking credit card applications from individuals with Armenian surnames, with some employees referring to them as "Armenian bad guys." California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff criticized the decision, calling it a "slap in the face" to the Armenian American community.</p>

          <p>South Africa's anti-migrant group, Operation Dudula, is actively picketing public health clinics, blocking foreigners from accessing healthcare facilities and demanding South African IDs. Despite constitutional guarantees for healthcare access regardless of nationality, and condemnations from government officials and major political parties, the group remains emboldened. This movement, meaning "to remove by force" in Zulu, claims to prioritize South Africans due to overburdened public services and limited resources. This has left many migrants, even legal ones, without essential medication and forced to seek expensive private alternatives.</p>

          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is experiencing a shift this year, with soaring gold and silver prices influencing consumer behavior. While demand for jewelry remains strong, many Indians are now buying precious metals more for investment than adornment, driven by a "fear of missing out" on rising prices. Jewellers are adapting by offering lighter, more elaborate-looking pieces to accommodate stagnant budgets. Investment demand, including in ETFs and digital gold, has significantly increased, with the Reserve Bank of India also heavily stocking gold to diversify foreign exchange holdings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by approximately 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This decline is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, including widespread availability of naloxone and innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs. States like North Carolina, with a 35% decrease, are leading the way by prioritizing drug users' health through medication-assisted treatment and diverting them from crime to recovery. Despite ongoing debates about abstinence-based approaches, medical evidence supports these harm reduction methods.</p>

          <p>The North Pacific Ocean recorded its warmest summer on record, with sea surface temperatures between July and September exceeding the previous high by over 0.25C across a vast area. This "warm blob" has confounded climate scientists, who struggle to fully explain its persistence despite global warming making marine heatwaves more likely. Theories include weaker-than-usual winds and a recent change to shipping fuels, which reduced Sun-reflecting aerosols. This extreme warmth has already impacted weather in Japan, South Korea, and the US, and could potentially lead to a colder start to winter in the UK and Europe.</p>

          <p>Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Tesla investors vote against a proposed pay plan for CEO Elon Musk, which could grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock. ISS cited "unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design," despite acknowledging the potential for enormous shareholder value if ambitious performance targets are met. Tesla's board, however, urged shareholders to approve the plan, accusing ISS of missing "fundamental points of investing and governance." This recommendation comes ahead of Tesla's November 5 annual shareholder meeting and follows a previous court ruling that rescinded Musk's 2018 pay package.</p>

The settlements, enabled by a 2020 California law suspending the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault victims, have severely strained the county's finances.
