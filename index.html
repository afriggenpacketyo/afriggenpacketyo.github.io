          <p>During a parliamentary debate marking the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, politicians from Germany's far-right AfD party caused widespread outrage. An AfD representative questioned whether the event constituted genocide, arguing that only men were targeted, a statement that ignores historical facts and court rulings. The comments drew sharp condemnation from other political parties, with one leader issuing a direct apology to Bosnia-Herzegovina's ambassador for the revisionist remarks.</p>

          <p>A dispute within Germany's ruling coalition has delayed judicial appointments after the conservative CDU/CSU bloc withdrew support for a Social Democrat candidate. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt downplayed the incident, describing the postponement as a normal part of the political process. However, critics from within the coalition have accused the conservatives of damaging democratic institutions, reflecting ongoing friction between the governing parties over key appointments and political strategy.</p>

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the high cost of beauty maintenance is an "insidious force" in women's financial lives. She describes the recurring expenses for hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel" that profits from insecurity and functions as a depreciating asset. The article details Tassin's perspective, suggesting that women are socialized to prioritize beauty as social capital and offers strategies for a "detox" to reclaim money, time, and energy.</p>

          <p>Animal care providers and rescue groups in Los Angeles are reporting a distressing trend of pets being abandoned or surrendered to shelters following recent immigration raids. As pet owners are detained, deported, or forced into hiding, their animals are sometimes left in empty homes or with unprepared friends. This influx is placing a heavy burden on the county's already overcrowded animal shelter system, highlighting an often-overlooked form of collateral damage from current immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in several California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups that accused federal agents of using unconstitutional tactics, such as racial profiling. The order specifically prohibits arrests based solely on factors like race, accent, or presence at known day-laborer sites, marking a significant legal challenge to recent enforcement operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of President Trump's unconventional trade policy of sending letters to foreign leaders that threaten significant new tariffs. The letters set high tariff rates to take effect on August 1 but also suggest they could be lowered if countries remove their own trade barriers. This approach has created considerable uncertainty in global markets, as so far only one new deal with the United Kingdom has been finalized, leaving many major U.S. trading partners facing the prospect of steep duties.

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that the plane's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position just seconds after take-off. This action starved the engines of fuel and caused a total loss of power. According to the cockpit voice recorder, one pilot asked the other why the fuel was cut, with the second pilot denying he had done so. The reason for the switch movement remains the central, unanswered question in the ongoing investigation.</p>
