          <p>Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company focused on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for childhood ADHD and autism, has seen its stock surge dramatically, despite reporting no revenue. The company's shares have risen over 58,000% this year, giving it a market capitalization exceeding established companies like Lululemon and eBay. This surge follows a stock split and increased attention on alternative medicines, and the company's CEO controls a significant portion of the outstanding shares. The company has claimed positive results from patient case studies using its TCM formulas, but it has not yet obtained regulatory approvals or demonstrated profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from both parties are working to restrict President Trump's authority to order strikes on Iran without congressional approval, citing the Constitution's mandate that Congress declares war. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna have introduced a resolution to block unauthorized strikes, while Sen. Tim Kaine is leading a similar effort in the Senate. The push comes amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with some senators urging strong action against Iran while others emphasize the need for congressional consent before military intervention. Sen. Bernie Sanders is also pushing a measure to prohibit the use of federal funds or any use of military force against Iran without consent from Congress, except in the case of self-defense.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are challenging five major pharmaceutical companies regarding their low tax bills and lobbying efforts related to President Trump's tax plan. Senators Warren and Schakowsky allege that these companies have avoided U.S. taxes by shifting profits to offshore subsidiaries, enabled by a provision in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. They are questioning whether the companies' lobbying activities were aimed at maintaining this tax loophole in the Republican tax bill. The lawmakers argue that these practices allow pharmaceutical corporations to profit from Americans while avoiding their fair share of taxes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a stark warning to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declaring him an "easy target" and demanding Iran's unconditional surrender in its conflict with Israel.

The threat comes after reports that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate the ayatollah.

While challenges remain in refining these treatments, some companies claim ADCs have shown the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings.

          <p>President Trump's travel ban, restricting entry to the U.S. from several countries, is raising concerns about its impact on global health research and collaboration. Researchers and advocates from affected countries are being barred from attending conferences and sharing expertise, potentially hindering efforts to address global health threats. Some experts argue that these restrictions could ultimately harm U.S. interests by limiting engagement with potential allies and impeding the detection and response to emerging diseases. The ban adds to existing concerns about the administration's cuts to foreign aid and withdrawal from the World Health Organization.</p>

          <p>Iran has two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, one Israel attacked on the first day of its assault at Natanz, and another at Fordo. Fordo, buried deep in a mountain, is where many analysts believe Iran has concealed clandestine efforts to work toward a nuclear weapons capability. As recently as March, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said American intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, but Israel's military asserted hours after initiating its attack on Iran last week that the U.S. information was outdated, claiming Iran was "racing towards a nuclear bomb." The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp-up its enrichment.</p>
