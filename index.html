          <p>Eleven students from Westhill High School in upstate New York turned themselves in after being accused of hazing younger lacrosse team members. The incident involved an abduction simulation with masks, black clothing, and imitation weapons, leading to potential kidnapping charges. The Onondaga County District Attorney described the event as "hazing on steroids," emphasizing the potential for tragedy. While no injuries were reported, the students deeply regretted their actions, recognizing the fear and distress experienced by the younger students, and the school district is cooperating with law enforcement's investigation.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has cut its growth forecast in half, now predicting only 0.5 percent growth for the fiscal year, citing the impact of trade policies and declining corporate profits. This decision was accompanied by holding interest rates steady at 0.5 percent, signaling caution in the face of global economic uncertainty. President Trump's tariffs, including those on imported cars, are weighing heavily on the Japanese economy, exacerbating existing pressures from weak consumer spending and inflation. The Bank of Japan is also concerned that a tariff-induced slowdown could lead to a decline in prices, complicating its efforts to normalize monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The estranged husband of Erin Patterson, accused of serving a poisonous mushroom lunch, testified that it was "very rare" for her to host social gatherings. Simon Patterson, who was invited but didn't attend, is the first witness in the trial where Erin Patterson is charged with murder and attempted murder of relatives. The case revolves around a beef wellington lunch in July 2023 that resulted in three deaths and one hospitalization. The prosecution alleges Patterson invited the group under the false pretense of having cancer, while the defense claims she panicked after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated there is a "very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, despite his trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, indicating that no official negotiations are currently underway. Trump emphasized that any deal must be fair, addressing his concerns about past trade imbalances. Greer, however, highlighted the need for a fair trade relationship where the US can manufacture and sell goods without harmful foreign trade practices, particularly from China.

          <p>Fifty years after the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam, Asia is adapting to a new power dynamic with China's growing influence. While the US is experiencing a withdrawal from aid and democratic ideals, Beijing's presence is increasingly felt throughout the region, from military bases in the South China Sea to economic inroads in Nepal. Although some countries express concerns about China's intentions, American ideals and images continue to resonate, even as the US struggles with its own internal challenges.

          <p>A recent poll by the Asian American Foundation reveals that one in four non-Asian Americans view Chinese-Americans as a potential threat, particularly regarding national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These results highlight a troubling disconnect between perceptions of Asian-Americans and their lived experiences, contributing to concerns about safety, belonging, and opportunities for prosperity. The survey underscores the persistence of the "perpetual foreigner" stereotype and its negative consequences.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee has scaled back a controversial bill aimed at ending solar credits for owners of rooftop solar systems. The original bill sought to limit benefits to 10 years, but the committee removed that provision, leaving only a change that would cancel the program for those selling their homes. The bill is supported by major utilities and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, who argue that the credits raise electric bills for non-solar owners. Opponents, including schools and environmental groups, argue the bill undermines investments in rooftop solar and unfairly changes the rules.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan held its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the country's economy.

The BOJ indicated it would continue to raise its policy rate if economic and price forecasts are realized, but also acknowledged that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits.</p>

          <p>Japanese energy firm Jera Co. has committed to ensuring a stable power supply this summer by utilizing the Kawagoe thermal power station, one of the world's largest LNG-fired plants. With a maximum output of 4.80 million kilowatts, the plant will compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation, which is rapidly expanding in the region. This summer, the area is projected to have an electricity reserve rate topping 8 percent, necessary for stable supply. LNG is expected to play a key role in bridging Japan's transition from fossil fuels to renewables as the country aims for net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

          <p>Democratic businessman Stephen Cloobeck is suing former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa over the use of the phrase "proven problem solver" in campaign materials. Cloobeck, who has applied for a federal trademark of the phrase, claims it has become associated with his campaign. Villaraigosa's representatives called the lawsuit ludicrous, noting that the phrase is commonly used by politicians. Legal scholars suggest the lawsuit has little chance of success, calling it more of a political tactic than a legal one.</p>
