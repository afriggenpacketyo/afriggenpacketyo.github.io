          <p>Analysts suggest China should adopt a pragmatic view of South Korea's new government, led by President Lee, who prioritizes shared international challenges. Lee's first foreign visit to Japan, a departure from tradition, signals a shift towards closer cooperation between the two nations, often seen as a response to the "China challenge." Beijing is advised to temper expectations regarding the Lee administration's foreign policy, which is strengthening alliances that implicitly address China's regional influence.

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud, a move she vows to challenge legally. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed board, stated Trump lacks the authority to dismiss her "for cause" under federal law, setting up a potential constitutional clash. This action escalates Trump's long-standing pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which he believes are hindering economic growth.

          <p>Food price inflation in the UK has reached a new 18-month high of 4.2% in August, primarily fueled by significant increases in the cost of chocolate, butter, and eggs.

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has fired National Police Chief General Nicolas Torre, who oversaw the arrests of former President Rodrigo Duterte and televangelist Apollo Carreon Quiboloy. While no specific reason was cited, Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla stated it was a presidential choice for a "new direction" for the police force, despite Torre not violating any laws. Torre had previously led the chaotic arrest of Duterte for International Criminal Court orders and the controversial apprehension of Quiboloy, who faces US child sexual assault charges.

          <p>California Republicans have filed an emergency petition with the state Supreme Court to block a November special election on Governor Gavin Newsom's redistricting plan. The measure, Proposition 50, aims to redraw congressional maps to favor Democrats, a move Democrats frame as a response to similar actions by Texas Republicans. Opponents argue the plan violates the state constitution, undermines the independent redistricting commission, and includes a single-subject rule violation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists claim a significant breakthrough in developing invisibility technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, traditionally vulnerable due to their powerful radar emissions. The new method utilizes frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigning each antenna a minutely varied frequency to make signals chaotic and resistant to interception and geolocation. This "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars could render AEW&C signals nearly undetectable, greatly enhancing their survivability and operational effectiveness. This article highlights a major advancement in military stealth technology.</p>
