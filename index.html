            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the US bond market due to volatility sparked by trade tariffs, which initially led to a flight to safety in bonds but quickly reversed as investors lost confidence in the US economy. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs has caused bond yields to rise sharply, impacting government borrowing costs and potentially affecting mortgages, credit cards, and business loans. President Trump's pause on higher tariffs, excluding China, suggests the bond market's reaction influenced his decision-making, drawing parallels to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK where bond market turmoil forced intervention.

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained in north Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law. The ACLU sued, arguing that the detainees were not informed of their right to contest the decision in court and were given notices in English despite some speaking only Spanish. The act, previously used sparingly, was invoked by the Trump administration to deport alleged gang members. The Supreme Court's order prevents the removal of detainees until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting.</p>

            <p>Economists warn that Donald Trump's tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, giving companies an excuse to raise prices even on goods not directly affected by the tariffs. Some experts fear this could lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, where consumers expect inflation and companies take advantage to increase profits. A study of Trump's previous tariffs on washing machines found that prices rose across the board, even for domestic machines. While Trump's inner circle acknowledges the danger of firms using tariffs as cover, they may resort to criticizing corporations for price gouging if inflation rises.</p>

            <p>A poll by the NASUWT teaching union reveals that social media influencers are contributing to an increase in misogyny and sexism in UK schools. Almost three in five teachers believe social media has negatively impacted behavior, with Andrew Tate specifically mentioned by several teachers. The Department for Education is supporting teachers in tackling the "damaging impact" of dangerous influencers. Union members will debate motions at their annual conference regarding the influence of far-right movements on social media.</p>

            <p>President Trump shared an image, believed to be digitally altered, claiming it showed the tattooed hand of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador. Trump asserted that Garcia had MS-13 tattoos, despite courts not finding evidence of gang affiliation. The image was posted shortly after Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Garcia in El Salvador. The case has involved legal battles and accusations of administrative errors and government overreach.</p>

            <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched seven scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, outdueling Jacob deGrom in the Dodgers' 3-0 win over the Rangers. Despite his fastball being slightly slower than usual, Yamamoto relied on his diverse repertoire, including an improved curveball and slider, to keep Rangers hitters off-balance. Manager Dave Roberts praised Yamamoto's performance, calling it his best outing and suggesting he is currently the best pitcher in the National League. Tommy Edman echoed this sentiment, emphasizing Yamamoto's ability to get ahead in the count and execute various pitches.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused under a wartime law of being foreign gang members. The ACLU argued the men were at risk of imminent removal to an El Salvadoran prison. The court stated that the government is directed not to remove any member of the detainees from the United States until further order of this Court. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.</p>
