          <p>Ukrainian war correspondent Viktoriia Roshchyna, who disappeared two years ago while reporting in Russian-occupied territories, has been buried in Kyiv. After 15 months in a Russian prison, she died during a transfer, and her body was returned to Ukraine in February. An investigation revealed signs of torture and that several internal organs were missing, leading Ukrainian authorities to open a war crimes investigation into her death. Roshchyna was posthumously awarded Ukraine's Order of Freedom for her courage and dedication.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain negative, with 46% and 45% approval respectively. The public also shows disapproval of his handling of key issues like inflation and federal spending, with only border security measures receiving a positive rating. Interestingly, while the Democratic Party holds a lead in congressional preference, its own favorability has dropped to a historic low. The survey highlights conflicting public sentiments amid a shifting political and economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a $600 billion, four-year investment plan in the United States, a move seen as appeasing President Trump's demands for domestic iPhone production without fully committing to it. The plan focuses on expanding partnerships with U.S. suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensor components, rather than shifting final assembly. In a related development, the Trump administration announced new tariffs on chips but granted an exemption to Apple. This strategy allows Apple to highlight its U.S. contributions while navigating complex global supply chains.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Israel's plan to take military control of Gaza City, calling the decision "wrong" and warning it will lead to more bloodshed. He emphasized that the action would not help secure the release of hostages and urged for a diplomatic solution, including a ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid. The statement aligns with criticism from other political figures like Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, who called for the UK to halt arms exports to Israel. The UK's stance signals a diplomatic divergence from the US on the issue.</p>

Once a booming sector, these companies have struggled with profitability and cooling online demand post-pandemic. This move marks a significant retreat for a once-hyped startup and its prominent founder.</p>

          <p>The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 has the highest theft rate in the United States, being stolen 39 times more often than the average vehicle, according to a new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute. The analysis of 2022-2024 models found that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks are common targets for thieves. The Camaro's vulnerability is reportedly linked to an on-board data port that can be exploited for theft. In contrast, electric vehicles were among the least stolen, possibly because they are often parked in secure garages.</p>

          <p>The predictable four-year price cycle of bitcoin, traditionally centered around its "halving" event, may be ending due to new market dynamics. Factors such as the introduction of U.S. bitcoin ETFs have attracted long-term institutional investors, altering typical price patterns and causing bitcoin to hit a new all-time high before the last halving, not after. Analysts suggest that a more supportive regulatory environment and reduced risk of major crypto-specific collapses are also contributing to this shift. This could mean that the era of massive 80% price crashes may be over, replaced by more stable, macro-correlated behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

The storm forced her family to relocate for her senior year of high school, severing her physical connection to her childhood home and city.

          <p>Youth sports in America have transformed from play-based activities into a highly commercialized, high-stakes industry, to the detriment of children. The rise of expensive pay-to-play leagues, costing families over $1,000 annually on average, has created a class divide and priced out many children. This professionalization, driven by parental anxiety over college admissions, puts young athletes at higher risk for injuries, depression, and anxiety.

While previously boasting that the U.S. had the world's best healthcare system, the party is now slashing medical research funding and elevating anti-science figures like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This shift, driven by anti-elite sentiment and culture-war politics, creates a "worst of all worlds" scenario: a system that will both lose its innovative edge and deny basic care to millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>A dating safety app called Tea, which allows women to anonymously review men and flag potential "red flags," has surged in popularity but is drawing significant criticism. The app, intended to make dating safer, has been criticized for serious privacy issues, potential for defamation lawsuits, and commodifying the concept of a "whisper network." Critics argue that its "name and shame" premise is problematic, and a recent cyberattack that exposed user data has amplified these concerns. The app's rise highlights the fraught landscape of modern dating and the complex, often flawed, attempts to address safety through technology.</p>

          <p>As a deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump for Russia to cease hostilities passes, Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines hold little hope for a negotiated peace. Commanders in the heavily embattled Donetsk region state that Russia is not interested in negotiations and that defeating them militarily is the only option. The sentiment from the trenches is one of grim determination, as Ukrainian forces face intense fighting and significant manpower shortages. This perspective from the battlefield contrasts with ongoing high-level diplomatic maneuvers, including a potential Trump-Putin summit.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Researchers have proposed the term "healthocide" to define the intentional and systematic destruction of healthcare infrastructure, personnel, and a population's overall well-being during conflict. Published in the journal BMJ Global Health, the term was inspired by the devastation of health systems in places like Gaza and Lebanon. Proponents hope the word will serve as a wakeup call and encourage the global medical community to condemn such acts, which they argue are becoming a deliberate strategy of modern warfare. The neologism has received a mixed reaction from humanitarian experts.</p>

          <p>Germany has announced it will suspend the approval of weapons exports to Israel for use in the Gaza Strip "until further notice," a significant policy shift for one of Israel's most steadfast allies. The decision follows Israel's approval of a plan to take over Gaza City, a move that has drawn international condemnation. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that while Israel has a right to self-defense, the escalating military action makes it difficult to achieve goals like hostage release. This marks a notable change in Germany's tone regarding the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government's plan to take military control of Gaza City has been met with fear and opposition from the families of hostages still held by Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum described the decision as "abandoning hostages" and a "colossal catastrophe," arguing that military escalation endangers their loved ones. They insist that a comprehensive negotiated deal is the only viable way to secure the hostages' return. This public backlash from within Israel highlights a deep societal division over the government's strategy in the war.</p>

          <p>Gold futures surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,500, following reports that the United States plans to apply its 39% tariff to certain 1kg gold bars imported from Switzerland. This move is seen as another significant blow to Switzerland, which is the global hub for gold refining and was already hit by steep U.S. tariffs. The precious metal, seen as a safe-haven asset, has already climbed about 25% this year amid market turmoil driven by global trade disputes. The new tariff could further disrupt the circular gold trade between London, New York, and Switzerland. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian contends that the widely cited official death toll in Gaza, around 60,000, is almost certainly a massive underestimate of the true number of fatalities. The author argues that the real toll, including indirect deaths from famine and lack of medical care, is likely in the hundreds of thousands. The piece points to the destruction of hospitals that count the dead, bodies buried under rubble, and Israel's restrictions on independent reporting as factors obscuring the full scale of the loss. It challenges the media to contextualize the official figure as a conservative minimum.</p>

          <p>China's steel industry is grappling with a devastating price war, forcing companies to sell products below cost simply to maintain cash flow and clear massive inventory. Industry insiders are now calling for changes to curb this self-destructive competition, which has erased profit margins across the sector. This aligns with a broader directive from Beijing to control downward price spirals in the economy. However, with chronic oversupply and shrinking demand, many in the industry remain skeptical about how effectively these state-led efforts can resolve the fundamental market challenges.</p>
