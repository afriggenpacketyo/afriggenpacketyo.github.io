          <p>Palestinian health officials report that at least 94 people were killed by Israeli military fire in Gaza on Sunday as they sought to obtain desperately needed food aid. The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, where crowds gathered around UN World Food Programme trucks. The Israel Defense Forces stated its troops fired warning shots to address an "immediate threat" and contested the number of casualties reported. The event highlights the severe hunger crisis in the region, with one wounded man lamenting that "hunger makes you desperate."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At 46 years old, legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao fought WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw, falling just short in his attempt to become one of boxing's oldest world champions. The competitive 12-round bout in Las Vegas saw one judge score it for Barrios while two others ruled it a draw. Despite his age, Pacquiao displayed impressive fitness, though Barrios, 16 years his junior, finished strong to retain his title. After the fight, Pacquiao expressed his belief that he had won the closely contested match.</p>

          <p>Amazon is implementing a new generative AI initiative, codenamed "Starfish," designed to create the most comprehensive and accurate source of product information online. The system aims to automate the creation of product listings by gathering data from across the web, which could significantly improve the shopping experience and boost sales. For sellers, Starfish promises to reduce the manual effort of creating listings, while shoppers may benefit from more detailed and consistent information. However, the project also raises questions about data scraping and the potential impact of AI-generated content on trust and quality.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, despite projections that his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election results reflect voter frustration with the Liberal Democratic Party over rising prices and a series of political scandals. While Ishiba accepted the "harsh result," the loss of the majority will undermine his government's influence and could lead to political instability, particularly during sensitive trade negotiations with the United States, potentially opening the door for a leadership challenge.

However, experts and analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the failure of past agreements and immediate disagreements over rebel withdrawal. The success of the deal hinges on sustained political will and the creation of an effective monitoring mechanism to turn principles into action.</p>

          <p>UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges by water companies in half by 2030, responding to public fury over the pollution of Britain's waterways. The commitment comes as new data shows serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. Reed stated that the water sector is "broken" and that its regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing." While ruling out nationalization, the government plans a record £104 billion investment in infrastructure, which will be funded in part by higher consumer water bills. (not investment advice)</p>

The choice of destination is notable given Vance's previous critical remarks about the UK and Europe, where he has accused leaders of suppressing free speech and failing on immigration. His visit comes as Donald Trump also spends time in the UK, and follows a speech in which Vance specifically criticized the Scottish government's policies, which could lead to a mixed reception during his travels.</p>
