          <p>China's consumer prices experienced a decline in April, raising concerns about deflation amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The national consumer price index (CPI) edged down by 0.1 percent year-on-year, mirroring the trend observed in the first three months of the year. High tariffs continue to impede bilateral trade, resulting in manufacturers facing mounting stockpiles of unsold goods. While food prices saw a slight decrease, prices for other goods and services, clothing, and housing experienced increases, highlighting the complex factors influencing China's economic landscape. The article outlines the struggles that China is facing as they attempt to keep their economy afloat.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have sharply escalated as both nations accuse each other of launching missile attacks on air bases and military installations. Pakistan reported that India targeted its bases with air-to-surface missiles, prompting a retaliatory response using short-range surface-to-surface missiles. The exchanges mark a significant intensification of the conflict, which began with a terrorist attack in Kashmir and has since involved drone warfare and cross-border shelling. Despite diplomatic pressure from international entities, neither country has shown signs of de-escalation, raising concerns about regional stability and the potential for further military action, as the article outlines the recent escalations.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at multiple federal agencies. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that federal employee unions are likely to prove that the administration's reorganization and downsizing efforts exceed its legal authority. This temporarily restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave to comply with an executive order mandating large-scale job cuts. The article describes that the order applies to DOGE and 20 federal agencies, marking a setback for the administration's cost-cutting agenda.</p>

This article describes that these toxins are produced by algae that shellfish consume, and cooking does not reliably eliminate the risk.
