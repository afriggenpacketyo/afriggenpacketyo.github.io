          <h2>Lutnick Stands Firm on Tariffs Amid Market Concerns</h2>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the Trump administration would not back down from its tariff plans despite significant stock market declines. He emphasized that the tariffs were essential to resetting global trade imbalances, with the President committed to implementing them without postponement. Lutnick's remarks align with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's stance, indicating a unified front in the administration's trade policy. The announcement follows substantial market losses after President Trump's tariff rollout on April 2, which included duties on all imported goods and higher levies on imports from numerous countries.

          <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller expressed his disapproval of tariffs exceeding 10%, distancing himself from President Trump's broader tariff plan. Druckenmiller reiterated his stance against high tariffs, stating that while he views tariffs broadly as a consumption tax, he only supports them within a 10% range. His comments follow significant market declines after Trump's tariff announcement, which imposed rates as high as 50% on some countries. Druckenmiller's statement highlights concerns within the investment community regarding the potential economic impact of the administration's trade policies.

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline, falling below $79,000, as cryptocurrencies joined the broader financial market sell-off triggered by President Trump's global tariffs. The flagship cryptocurrency, often seen as a leading indicator of market sentiment, traded down 5%, reflecting investor unease. Other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana also suffered substantial losses. Bitcoin's decline triggered a wave of liquidations, as traders betting on price increases were forced to sell assets.

Some hybrid vehicles will also remain on the market until 2035. The move comes as President Trump imposed a 25% tariff on cars imported to the US, a major export market for the UK motor industry.</p>

The state legislature has not adequately or consistently funded these programs, and there is demand from farmers for incentives that exceeds the funding available.

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open despite severe staffing shortages, raising concerns about safety and maintenance. The order requires approval from the National Park Service director and assistant secretary before any closures or reduced hours. The National Parks Conservation Assn. criticized the mandate as reckless and out of touch, citing reduced staffing levels and increased visitation. The directive comes after President Trump cut about 1,000 National Park Service workers this year.</p>

Forecasters warned that flooding could persist for days, with tornadoes possible in some areas, as the number of canceled and delayed flights continues to rise.</p>

          <h2>Tariff Selling May Not Be Over: A Market Navigation Strategy</h2>

          <p>The recent market sell-off driven by President Trump's tariffs has created uncertainty, but completely bailing on the market would be ill-advised. The author suggests buying non-tariffed winners and being clinical in this emotional moment, with the S&P 500 potentially dropping to 4,000. A European response could further drive the market lower, and the possibility of a recession exists. Despite the cons, countervailing forces like declining bond yields and the potential for negotiation offer some optimism.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is prepared to use industrial policy to protect British businesses from the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs. Plans include relaxing targets on electric vehicle sales, implementing anti-dumping safeguards, and accelerating government investment in UK industry and infrastructure. The UK government will also push for an economic deal with the US to avoid some of the tariffs. The largest export of goods to the US in 2024 was cars and auto parts, with a value of around £9bn.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed a rise in serious childcare incidents reported by nurseries in England, with almost 20,000 reports in the past five years. The latest figures show a 40% increase compared to five years prior, including serious injuries, harm, and rare cases of deaths. Parents of a baby killed by a nursery worker are calling for stronger safeguarding measures. The BBC spoke to nursery workers who said short-staffing was a factor, and a former Ofsted inspector said the regulator is not conducting enough inspections.</p>

          <p>The Manchester derby ended in a dull goalless draw, prompting criticism from former players about the lack of intensity and risk. Manchester City manager Ruben Amorim said that the two teams are in a bad moment. The game highlighted the current state of both clubs, with City outside the top four and United struggling to compete with mid-table teams.
