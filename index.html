The Pacers overcame a 20-point deficit, with Haliburton scoring 11 of his 19 points in the final quarter. Donovan Mitchell's impressive 48-point performance was not enough for Cleveland, who were missing key players due to injuries. The Pacers' victory marks their first time winning the first two games of a playoff series on the road since 1994, setting the stage for Game 3 in Indiana.</p>

          <p>Two Trump administration officials will meet with their Chinese counterparts to discuss trade, weeks after the United States and China imposed steep tariffs on each other. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with his counterpart from China, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will meet with China's lead representative on economic matters. China has said it is open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade but wants the Trump administration to drop its tariffs first. Bessent said that the U.S. and China have shared interests because the high tariffs are not sustainable.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with the new Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in the Oval Office, adopting a friendlier tone after months of belittling Canada. Trump, who had previously joked about Canada becoming the 51st state, expressed his love for Canada and its people. Despite the cordial atmosphere, Carney remained guarded, while Trump veered off-topic, discussing subjects ranging from Obama's library to diplomacy with the Houthis. The New York Times article highlights the awkwardness and recrimination stemming from Trump's earlier rhetoric.</p>
