          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with initial winds of 50 mph. The storm has since weakened as it moves inland and is expected to become a tropical depression. Flood watches remain in effect for parts of the Carolinas, with forecasts predicting 2 to 4 inches of rain and the potential for isolated tornadoes. Chantal is the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and is projected to dissipate by Monday.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding along the Guadalupe River in central Texas has resulted in at least 50 deaths, including 15 children, with dozens more still missing. A children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, was severely impacted, accounting for many of the missing. The river reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities by surprise. State and federal authorities, including the U.S. Coast Guard, are conducting extensive search and rescue operations amid a declared disaster.</p>

          <p>A new Florida law effective July 1 allows pregnant women to apply for an "expectant mother parking permit," granting them access to accessible parking spaces for up to one year. The initiative, which costs $15 for a temporary placard, has generated mixed reactions on social media. Supporters, including the sponsoring state representative, argue it provides necessary assistance, especially in the heat and for those with other children. Critics, however, question whether pregnancy should be classified as a condition requiring such accommodations.</p>

          <p>An NPR producer in Gaza provides a harrowing first-person account of the life-threatening journey to obtain food from a U.S.- and Israeli-supported distribution site. The process involves navigating Israeli military fire, armed private contractors, and violent crowds, a situation the UN has called a "death trap." The journalist describes widespread hunger, lawlessness, and the daily risk of death faced by civilians, highlighting a system where even successfully acquiring food means surviving theft and violence. The report details a scene of desperation where bodies are shrouded in empty flour sacks.</p>

          <p>Rick Spinrad, the former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), stated that significant staffing cuts under the Trump administration have weakened the agency's ability to predict severe weather. He noted many weather forecast offices are understaffed, placing an extra burden on remaining personnel and potentially degrading forecast accuracy. While not directly blaming the cuts for the lack of advance warning in the recent Texas floods, Spinrad warned that predictions for hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods will inevitably degrade. This compromises the public's ability to prepare for natural disasters.</p>

Despite his fame, he found solace and a sense of belonging in the pilot house of a steamboat, reflecting on his past as a river pilot.

The suggestion comes amid broader calls from Sir Mark for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales to better manage overstretched funding.

Since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, no other nation had granted them formal recognition. Experts suggest Russia's decision is driven by economic interests, including positioning Afghanistan as a trade hub, and a desire to lead a coalition of autocratic states in establishing new diplomatic norms. The move has raised concerns among human rights activists, who fear it legitimizes the Taliban's oppressive policies, particularly against women.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League is uncertain, pending the outcome of an appeal by French club Lyon, which is also owned by John Textor's Eagle Football Holdings. Uefa rules prevent two clubs with the same influential owner from competing in the same tournament, and Lyon's potential relegation could clear the path for Palace. This complex situation unfolds as Textor is set to sell his 43% stake in Palace to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson. The tangled web of multi-club ownership highlights the complicated financial and regulatory challenges facing modern football.</p>

          <p>In the first six months of his second term, President Trump has taken numerous executive actions that critics warn are expanding presidential power and undermining democratic norms. These actions include ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, using national emergency declarations to impose tariffs, and deploying the National Guard against a state's wishes. Analysts note that while the expansion of executive power is a long-term trend, Trump's approach is a deliberate and strategic project to eliminate established limits. This raises concerns about the long-term implications for the balance of power in the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural significance of professional wrestling, focusing on the pivotal 1996 moment when Hulk Hogan, the all-American hero, turned into a "heel" (a villain). This narrative shift, which created the "New World Order" faction, is presented as a masterclass in storytelling that blurred the lines between fiction and reality for audiences. The piece analyzes how this event captivated fans and argues that such moments in wrestling offer a unique form of theater that plays with audience expectations. It also reflects on how this embrace of "heeldom" may have prefigured later political trends.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's promises of a "golden age" and critics' predictions of an "economic catastrophe," the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly stable five months into his second term. Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have not shifted dramatically, and GDP growth continues at a moderate pace. The article argues that Trump's policies have had limited immediate impact, as his promised "drill, baby, drill" approach had little room to grow and his tariff threats were quickly moderated. While long-term fundamentals may be at risk, the short-term reality is an economy that is simply "okay," not booming or collapsing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, has become a box office success but struggles to achieve its goal of appealing to non-believers. The review notes that while the film features a high-profile cast and attempts to be educational, its on-the-nose evangelism and awkward humor may alienate a broader audience. The article contrasts it with more successful biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt" and "The Chosen," which use character-driven drama to resonate more widely. It concludes that the film is likely to remain popular primarily within its intended faith-based market.</p>

          <p>Following the New York mayoral primary victory of progressive Zohran Mamdani, some analysts are questioning if the Democratic party is on the verge of a grassroots populist takeover, similar to the Republican Tea Party movement of 2010. This potential shift is fueled by a divide between the party's establishment and a more progressive, populist wing, with base voters expressing anger and a desire for new leadership. Unlike the original Tea Party, the progressive movement's priorities are more disparate, but there is a shared frustration with current congressional leadership and a focus on working-class economic issues.</p>

          <p>FIFA has dramatically cut ticket prices for the Club World Cup semi-final match between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium. Standard tickets that were priced at over $470 earlier in the week were reduced to just $13.40. This move is part of a dynamic pricing strategy used for the tournament. The price drop follows similar reductions for quarter-final matches in other cities. In contrast, tickets for the other semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid still start at nearly $200, suggesting a significant difference in demand.</p>

          <p>The German government is facing three new lawsuits from individuals whose asylum applications were immediately rejected at the German-Polish border. This follows a June court ruling that found the immediate transfer of three Somali nationals back to Poland without a proper review was unlawful. The government had argued the turnbacks were justified because the migrants were arriving from a safe third country. Despite fears of a wave of legal challenges after the initial ruling, the number of new cases has been limited, though the Interior Minister has vowed to take the issue to a European court.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Republicans are escalating their campaign against state laws that allow mail-in ballots to be counted if they arrive after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by that date. A recent executive order and several GOP-backed lawsuits aim to enforce a strict Election Day receipt deadline, with proponents arguing it is necessary for uniform election results. At least three states have already passed laws eliminating their grace periods. This push is closely tied to Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud and his desire for immediate election night results, despite no evidence of widespread issues with late-arriving ballots.</p>

          <p>In a retaliatory trade measure, China has excluded European Union companies that do not have operations in China from government contracts for medical devices valued at over US$6.3 million. The new restriction, effective immediately, also limits non-EU companies from allocating more than half of a contract's value to importing medical devices from the EU. China's Ministry of Commerce described the move as a "last resort" and a "reciprocal countermeasure."

          <p>This opinion piece argues that ranked-choice voting (RCV) was a major winner in the recent New York City mayoral primary, which saw long-shot progressive Zohran Mamdani secure the Democratic nomination. The author contends that RCV fostered a more positive, issue-focused campaign by eliminating the "spoiler" effect and incentivizing candidates to build coalitions and seek second-choice votes. This allowed a lesser-known candidate to gain momentum without the pressure for progressives to consolidate early behind a single choice. The high turnout and positive voter feedback suggest RCV can create more engaging and representative elections.</p>
