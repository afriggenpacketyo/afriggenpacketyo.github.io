          <p>Shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy, surged over 20% after billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, disclosed a 9% stake. The investment has amplified interest in Ethereum-related assets, with similar companies also seeing their stock prices rise. This move follows increased momentum for Ethereum due to new trading options in Europe and progress on U.S. stablecoin legislation, highlighting growing mainstream financial interest in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, located in The Hague. Comprised of 15 judges from different nations, the court adjudicates disputes between states, distinct from the International Criminal Court which tries individuals. Its jurisdiction depends on states' consent, either through a blanket declaration or specific agreements, such as the UN Genocide Convention, which underpins cases like Ukraine v. Russia and South Africa v. Israel. However, the ICJ lacks an enforcement mechanism, relying on the cooperation of the involved parties for its rulings to be effective.</p>

          <h2>Key Details Emerge Regarding a Major UK Data Breach Affecting Afghan Relocation Applicants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 15:13:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant data breach by a UK Special Forces official in February 2022 exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation to the UK. The leak, which became public after a court injunction was lifted, contained sensitive information that could put applicants at risk from the Taliban. In response, the UK government secretly established a £850 million emergency relocation program, bringing approximately 4,500 people to safety so far. Questions remain about the full extent of the harm caused and the accountability for the initial error.</p>

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer with Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder and advisor, fell more than 20% on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The public listing occurred after a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and Trump Jr. rang the NYSE opening bell to mark the occasion. He framed the event as a "vindication" against "woke nonsense." The company's poor initial performance highlights the volatility of stocks tied to political figures and conservative causes.

Directed by Wes Ball, who aims for a "live-action Miyazaki" feel, the film's release has been pushed to May 7, 2027.

The decision follows months of campus protests and criticism regarding antisemitism.

          <p>A recent uptick in the Consumer Price Index, with annual inflation reaching 2.7% in June, is raising concerns about the cost of consumer borrowing. Since most credit card interest rates are variable and linked to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, persistent inflation could lead the Fed to maintain or increase its high rates. This would cause credit card APRs, already averaging over 21%, to remain elevated or climb further. For consumers carrying a balance, this means higher interest payments, making it more difficult to pay down debt amid rising living costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has called on Israeli authorities to conduct an aggressive investigation into the killing of a 20-year-old Palestinian-American, Sayfollah Musallat. Musallat was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, an act Huckabee described as criminal and terrorist. The incident has drawn attention from President Trump, who announced a meeting on the matter. The victim's family states he was protecting his family's land and has called for a U.S. State Department investigation into his death.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, is on trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela Craig, who he allegedly killed by lacing her protein shakes with cyanide. Prosecutors argue that Craig, who was having an affair and facing financial troubles, deliberately poisoned his wife over several days in March 2023. The defense does not dispute the presence of poison or the affair but suggests Angela may have died by suicide, a claim prosecutors say is unsubstantiated. Craig also faces additional charges for allegedly trying to orchestrate a cover-up from jail, including soliciting a hit on the lead investigator.</p>

The bylaw requires an investor to own a 3% stake, currently worth about $30 billion, to bring such a suit. Officials from the New York State Common Retirement Fund accused Tesla of a "bait-and-switch," arguing the company assured shareholders their rights would be equivalent after moving its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.

          <p>President Trump has rejected calls from within his own party to release more files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, labeling the controversy a "hoax" and a "scam" created by Democrats. This comes as his administration faces criticism for its handling of the case, particularly after the Justice Department found no evidence of a "client list." Trump disavowed supporters focusing on the issue, stating he no longer wants their support. When pressed by reporters, the president insisted the matter was a hoax without providing evidence and questioned if his name was in the unreleased files.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the termination of a multi-billion-dollar federal grant program for disaster resilience. The lawsuit argues that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) acted unlawfully when it canceled the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program in April. The program helps fund infrastructure projects like flood walls and evacuation shelters to protect communities from natural disasters. The states contend that the administration cannot alter FEMA's core mission of disaster mitigation without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>The back-to-school shopping season has started unusually early this year, with two-thirds of families already making purchases, a significant increase from last year. According to a National Retail Federation survey, over half of these early shoppers are motivated by concerns that President Trump's threatened tariffs will drive up prices on school supplies, apparel, and electronics. While overall spending is projected to increase to $128.2 billion, average spending per family is expected to be slightly lower. Retailers like Walmart and Amazon are responding with early sales to attract budget-conscious consumers.</p>

          <p>SBH Health System, a safety-net hospital in the Bronx, is anticipating severe financial consequences from the proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill," also known as Trumpcare. The hospital's president, Dr. David Perlstein, predicts a loss of $75 million, or 12% of its budget, as an estimated 100,000 residents in its congressional district are expected to lose their health insurance. With two-thirds of its local population on Medicaid, the hospital lacks the financial cushion to absorb such a hit without cutting essential services.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% annually in June, marking the highest inflation reading since February and indicating a gradual increase in price pressures across the U.S. economy.
