          <p>Marks & Spencer stores experienced empty shelves due to a cyber attack disrupting their operations, with online orders paused and some services affected over the Easter weekend. While contactless pay and Click & Collect issues have been resolved, online orders remain suspended, impacting a significant portion of their clothing and household goods sales. Analysts predict the disruption will negatively affect M&S's profits as customers seek alternatives. The retailer is working to restore normal availability across its stores and has not disclosed details about the nature of the cyber attack, but took systems offline as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win the Canadian federal election but will likely form a minority government, falling short of the desired majority in the House of Commons. Despite increased support, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is expected to lose his seat, as is NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. The election saw a significant rise in the vote share for both the Liberals and Conservatives, largely at the expense of smaller parties. The Liberals are expected to win the most seats in Ontario and Quebec, while the Conservatives are ahead in Alberta.</p>

He returned to the mountain to search for his cell phone and other belongings, but was found unable to move, again showing symptoms of altitude sickness. Authorities are urging caution during the off-season due to harsh conditions, including low temperatures and snow cover.

          <p>Adidas announced that U.S. tariffs implemented by President Trump will lead to price increases on all of its products sold in the U.S. The company is uncertain about the exact amount of the price hikes and notes that the ongoing global trade dispute prevents it from raising its full-year outlook despite increased profits. While Adidas has reduced exports of China-made products to the U.S., the general increase in U.S. tariffs on other countries is having a significant impact. Adidas currently cannot produce almost any of its products in the U.S.</p>

The satellite will "weigh" the Earth's forests to determine how much carbon is stored within trees, helping scientists model climate change more accurately and track deforestation rates. The satellite uses radar with a long wavelength to penetrate deep into forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy. The project aims to create annual maps showing carbon storage and deforestation, providing consistent data unaffected by cloud cover.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to restart forced collections on federal student loans in default, potentially garnishing borrowers' paychecks after a five-year reprieve. With collections resuming, the last aspect of pandemic-era relief has ended, which began with President Trump's pause on federal student loan payments in March 2020. Millions of borrowers are in default or on the verge, and are starting to see their credit scores plummet. At the same time, the Biden-era SAVE repayment program is frozen due to legal challenges, creating uncertainty for borrowers.</p>
