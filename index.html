          <p>A significant explosion at a major port in southern Iran has caused widespread damage, killing at least 25 people and injuring over 700. The blast, which occurred at Shahid Rajaee port, sent shockwaves felt miles away and prompted school and office closures due to air pollution. While the cause remains unconfirmed, initial reports suggest flammable chemicals stored at the port may be responsible, with some sources pointing to improperly stored sodium perchlorate, a missile fuel component. The incident occurred during a sensitive time, coinciding with ongoing nuclear talks between Iranian and US delegations in Oman. The port has resumed partial operations amidst ongoing investigations.

The rivalry had been previously marred by a failed drugs test by Benn, leading to the cancellation of a scheduled bout in 2022.

          <p>Europe's pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential pain as President Trump threatens to impose higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals. The move could have serious consequences for drugs made in the European Union. Pharmaceutical products and chemicals are the bloc's top export to America, including blockbuster drugs like Ozempic and cancer treatments. The implementation of tariffs would disrupt decades of tariff-free trade aimed at making medicine affordable. Optimism score: 40</p>
          <p>40/100</p>

          <p>Australia is considering capping the number of international students as a way to address its unaffordable housing crisis. Politicians on both sides are proposing the measure to reduce demand for rentals and starter homes. This marks a significant shift for Australia, which has historically seen international education as a major economic driver. The move could impact those hoping to pursue education and citizenship in Australia. Optimism score: 45</p>
