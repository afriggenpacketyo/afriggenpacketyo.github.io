Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 after she believed she'd been discriminated against on the basis of her sexual orientation, after she was demoted and replaced with a gay man after applying for a management position.

A sour tone or attitude can signal contempt, a predictor of divorce. Family arguments often reflect unmet needs, while chore disputes stem from uneven labor distribution. Ineffective communication can derail conversations, but couples can improve by naming the load, reassuring one another, and using a designated word or phrase to signal a time-out.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico and is expected to become a hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is currently located about 170 miles southwest of Zihuatanejo, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, the storm is likely to bring heavy rainfall to western Mexico, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also expected to generate dangerous sea swells and rip currents along the southwestern coast.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has vowed to prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip, citing the need to maintain a naval blockade to prevent Hamas from importing arms. The vessel, named Madleen, is operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and carries 12 activists. The coalition claims Israel is jamming their communications as they approach Gaza, with the ship departing Sicily last Sunday with plans to reach Gaza's territorial waters. This action is part of Israel's ongoing policy to maintain a blockade until hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles to confront immigration protests, a move seen as an assault on democracy and civil-military relations, according to this article. By militarizing the situation, Trump aims to provoke Americans and justify the use of armed force against them. He may be hoping to distract from his failures, establish his authority, and radicalize citizen-soldiers. The author warns against confronting the military, arguing that it would only provide Trump with the pretext he seeks to expand his power.</p>

Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objection, Trump federalized the National Guard, with the Defense Secretary warning that U.S. Marines were also on "high alert," signaling a rare use of the active duty military on U.S. soil.</p>
