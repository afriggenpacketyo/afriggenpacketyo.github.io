          <p>A subsidiary of Nongfu Spring, a beverage company founded by China's wealthiest man, Zhong Shanshan, has acquired an industrial site in Nashua, New Hampshire. The company plans to build a beverage plant and purchase surplus city water, a proposal that has drawn local scrutiny and concern. This move highlights the growing political and national security sensitivities surrounding Chinese investments in the U.S., even for seemingly straightforward business deals. The project's future appears uncertain amid the heightened political climate regarding Chinese economic influence.</p>

          <p>Iran is escalating the deportation of Afghan refugees, with over 1.3 million already returned to an uncertain future in Afghanistan. The Iranian government is reportedly using disinformation, labeling Afghans as spies, and implementing policies that restrict their access to banking, housing, and employment. This has created a humanitarian crisis at the border, overwhelming aid organizations as returnees face a country already struggling with high unemployment and severe restrictions, especially for women. The situation is compounded by similar expulsions from Pakistan and Tajikistan, placing immense strain on Afghanistan's limited resources.</p>

          <p>A father and son, identified as Terry McMillan, 58, and Brendan McMillan, 27, were killed in a stabbing incident at a business in Bermondsey, London. The attack, which occurred on Monday afternoon, also left another man in his 30s in a life-threatening condition. Police have arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of murder, who is currently hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities believe the attack was a targeted and isolated incident, and a crime scene remains in place as the investigation continues.</p>

The note reportedly asked for his brain to be studied. Tamura, who had a history of mental health holds, drove from Las Vegas with a semiautomatic rifle to carry out the attack.</p>

          <p>Despite anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve's July meeting, credit card interest rates are not expected to decrease in the near future. Even if the Fed were to cut its benchmark rate, which is considered unlikely this month, the impact on consumer credit card rates would be minimal due to their connection to the separate prime rate. With average credit card interest rates remaining near record highs, the article suggests that borrowers struggling with debt should consider alternative relief options. These options include debt forgiveness programs or consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is leading a coalition of states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new law that blocks Planned Parenthood and other large abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funds. The provision, part of a larger bill, bars funding even for non-abortion services like cancer screenings and STI testing, which critics call a "backdoor abortion ban." This legal challenge follows a preliminary injunction granted in a separate lawsuit by Planned Parenthood, which temporarily blocked the ban nationwide. The states argue the measure illegally targets a specific organization and will harm healthcare access for millions of low-income Americans.</p>

Unlike Reaganism, which was based on a coherent philosophy, "Trumpism" is described as being defined by Trump's own instincts, ego, and a desire for unpredictability. This has led to frustration among his supporters, such as immigration hawks and foreign policy "restrainers," who find the former president's actions often contradict their policy goals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear a critical case this week that challenges the legality of the Trump administration's use of tariffs. The lawsuit, brought by small businesses and 12 states, argues that President Trump exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs without congressional approval. A lower court previously struck down the tariffs, ruling the trade deficit did not constitute a national emergency under IEEPA, but that decision was stayed on appeal. A victory for the plaintiffs could significantly curtail the president's power to unilaterally enact trade policy.</p>

          <p>The median price for an existing home in the United States hit a new record of $435,300 in June, despite home sales being at historically low levels.

High prices combined with mortgage rates above 6.5% have sidelined many potential buyers. A monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home with a 20% down payment is now approximately $2,273, before taxes and insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge dismissed the request for a summary judgment and interim damages, ruling that the complex dispute must proceed to a full trial. The case involves the unique governance of the historic venue, where 1,268 of the hall's seats are privately owned by members who helped fund its construction.</p>
