          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president of Nigeria, has passed away in London at the age of 82 after a prolonged illness. Buhari's long political career included leading the country as a military ruler following a coup in the 1980s. He later transitioned to democratic politics, winning the presidency in 2015 in an election widely considered to be the nation's fairest to that point. He served as president until 2023, leaving a complex legacy of democratic transition and security challenges during his tenure.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas that killed over 100 people, Senator Maria Cantwell stated that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The senator is advocating for a major, bipartisan investment in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to upgrade technology like Doppler radar and data analytics. She argued that such improvements could provide residents with more advanced warnings, similar to successful tornado predictions in the Midwest, and warned against proposed budget cuts that could undermine these life-saving scientific missions.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett confirmed that the Trump administration is investigating whether it has the legal authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While President Trump has stated he does not want to fire Powell, officials are escalating criticisms, particularly over a $700 million budget overrun on a Fed renovation project, potentially to establish "cause" for removal. This development heightens concerns about the politicization of the central bank and its independence in setting monetary policy, a core principle of U.S. economic stability.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The backlash grew after a Justice Department memo stated there was no "incriminating client list" and confirmed Epstein's death was a suicide, disappointing those who expected major revelations. In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job," signaling his support for the attorney general amid a growing feud between the DOJ and some FBI officials over the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to growing concerns about player welfare, FIFA has announced its support for mandatory rest periods for professional soccer players. The new guidelines endorse a minimum of 72 hours between matches and a three-week break at the end of each season. This move comes amid an escalating dispute with the global players' union, Fifpro, which has criticized the expanded fixture calendar, including the new 32-team Club World Cup. While the union welcomed the commitment, it also raised concerns about the process, as key representatives were not present at the meeting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 20.9% tariff on most Mexican tomato imports is set to take effect, potentially leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers and severe consequences for small businesses. The new duties will replace a nearly three-decade-old trade agreement that the Commerce Department claims failed to protect U.S. growers from unfairly low-priced imports. Restaurant owners fear the price hikes could be ruinous, while some U.S. farmers support the move to combat what they describe as illegal dumping by Mexican producers, highlighting a sharp divide within the industry.

          <p>Years before dozens of children died in catastrophic flooding, many buildings at Camp Mystic in Texas were reportedly removed from official flood risk maps at the camp's request. According to media reports citing official records, FEMA maps from 2011 had designated the riverside summer camp as a high-risk flood zone. However, the camp successfully appealed these designations, which would have required stricter building regulations and mandatory flood insurance. This revelation raises serious questions about safety protocols and oversight in the lead-up to the tragic July 4th disaster.</p>

          <p>The political landscape in North Carolina is set for a major shift, as Senator Thom Tillis's decision not to seek re-election in 2026 transforms the race into a highly competitive toss-up.

The retirement of the incumbent Republican senator will likely lead to crowded and expensive primary battles for both parties.

Beijing's response could range from heightened rhetoric and diplomatic pressure to its own military posturing in the Taiwan Strait.
