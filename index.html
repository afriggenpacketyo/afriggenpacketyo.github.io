        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Pentagon official stated that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, in response to ongoing immigration-enforcement protests, is estimated to cost $134 million. Acting Pentagon Comptroller Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell attributed the cost primarily to housing, travel, and food expenses for the deployed troops. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment as necessary for community safety and to enable ICE agents to perform their duties without being attacked. The deployment includes 4,000 members of the California National Guard and approximately 700 Marines, funded through the military's Operation & Maintenance accounts. The deployment is expected to last 60 days. The optimism score reflects the financial cost of the situation, rather than any qualitative assessment.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a warning that protesters attending his military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, would be met with "heavy force." He reiterated this threat multiple times, stating that these protesters "hate our country." Security officials and the U.S. Secret Service reported tracking approximately nine protests planned for the parade, which coincides with Trump's 79th birthday. Despite the planned protests, officials anticipate a smaller number of protesters compared to the parade attendees. The tone of the article is a neutral report of the president's warning and the security preparations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration raids. State Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that a temporary restraining order is necessary to prevent immediate harm to the state's sovereignty and to de-escalate tensions. Newsom characterized Trump's actions as tyrannical and a threat to democracy, while Trump defended the deployment by claiming it was necessary to prevent Los Angeles from burning. The lawsuit alleges that Trump federalized the California National Guard without Newsom's consent, which is a violation of the law. The optimism score is based on the conflict between the state and federal government and the potential for increased civil unrest.</p>

          <p>A school shooting in Graz, Austria, has resulted in eleven fatalities after one of the injured victims died in the hospital. The 21-year-old gunman, a former student, took his own life in a school bathroom following the attack at Dreierschützengasse secondary school. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner reported that six females and three males were killed initially, with a further 12 people injured. The gunman's motive is currently under investigation, and authorities confirmed that he legally owned the two guns used in the attack. Three days of mourning have been declared in Austria, and the school will remain closed until further notice. The tone of the article reflects the seriousness and tragedy of the event.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of serious disorder with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks being thrown at police. Officers responded with baton rounds, water cannon, and riot dogs in the Clonavon Terrace area, where similar violence erupted the previous night following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault. One assembly member reported that a family with three young children had to barricade themselves in their attic during the initial violence. A 29-year-old man has been charged with riotous behavior, disorderly behavior, attempted criminal damage, and resisting police. The police described the actions as "racist thuggery," and the prime minister's official spokesman described the events as "very concerning."</p>

          <p>A major international study of nearly 300,000 children has revealed a two-way link between screen time and emotional and social well-being. Children who spent more time using devices like TVs, tablets, computers, and gaming consoles were at a higher risk of developing problems like aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The study also found that children struggling with social or emotional challenges tended to spend more time on screens. Time spent on gaming consoles was particularly linked to a greater chance of developing issues. The article provides a nuanced view, noting that moderate screen time for educational purposes carries a lower risk.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that embracing wild lawns, through movements like "Let It Bloom June," may offer unexpected health benefits. Dr. Michael Policastro, a medical toxicologist, notes that lawn and garden work can be physically taxing, leading to muscle strains, back pain, and joint injuries. Repetitive motions and awkward postures can strain the body over time, and chemical pesticides and herbicides can pose risks when airborne. Mental health professionals also suggest that natural environments can promote mindfulness and a sense of calm.

The judge noted that although Morales-Reyes has been arrested several times since 1996, he has only been convicted once, for disorderly conduct. An attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security did not oppose the bond request. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that while Morales-Reyes is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, he is in the country illegally with previous arrests.

The survey, conducted by Match and the Kinsey Institute, also found that almost half of the respondents have experienced this phenomenon themselves. This increase may be due to the prevalence of swipe-based dating apps, which encourage quick judgments about potential partners.
