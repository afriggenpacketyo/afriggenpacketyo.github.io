            <p>Sony has announced a price increase for the PlayStation 5 in several regions, citing challenging market conditions such as high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. The digital edition of the console will see a £40 price jump in the UK and a €50 increase in Europe. While the price of the physical edition remains unchanged in the UK, the cost of disc drives for digital consoles has been reduced, offering some relief to consumers. This decision reflects the ongoing economic pressures affecting the technology sector globally.</p>

            <p>A report by Democratic members of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee warns that proposed cuts to Medicaid could severely limit access to subsidized medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, potentially affecting over 100,000 beneficiaries. Senator Maggie Hassan highlights that Medicaid is crucial for providing addiction treatment amid the fentanyl crisis. The report points out that several states have trigger laws that would immediately halt certain Medicaid expansion subsidies if federal funding is reduced. The Democrats argue that these cuts would jeopardize progress in addressing the opioid crisis.</p>

            <p>Research reveals that paper receipts from major US retailers contain high levels of bisphenol S (BPS), a chemical linked to cancer and reproductive problems. Holding a receipt for just 10 seconds can lead to skin absorption exceeding California's safety threshold. The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) has issued violation notices to approximately 50 retailers, urging them to switch to BPS-free paper or provide warnings to consumers. This raises concerns for cashiers and retail workers who handle receipts frequently, highlighting the need for safer alternatives in everyday products.</p>

            <p>Critics are raising alarms about potential conflicts of interest as the Trump administration deregulates the cryptocurrency industry while the Trump family expands its financial footprint in the sector through World Liberty Financial. Deregulatory moves, including disbanding a cryptocurrency enforcement team and softening industry oversight, coincide with World Liberty Financial launching its own stablecoin. Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats are questioning the SEC's actions related to Trump family interests, highlighting concerns about corruption and consumer protection.

            <p>Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that a complete decoupling between the US and Chinese capital markets could result in a staggering $2.5 trillion loss. US investors might be forced to sell nearly $800 billion in Chinese stocks, while China could liquidate its US Treasury and equity holdings amounting to $1.3 trillion and $370 billion, respectively. This analysis comes amid escalating trade tensions and discussions about delisting Chinese companies from US exchanges. The potential sell-off underscores the significant financial risks associated with increasing economic separation between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A growing number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are becoming resistant to antibiotics, prompting concerns about the broader issue of antibiotic resistance. Experts warn that antibiotic-resistant UTIs are a "canary in the coal mine" for a larger global health threat. With the recent FDA approval of a new antibiotic, gepotidacin, efforts are underway to combat this problem. Individuals are encouraged to use antibiotics responsibly and explore alternative treatments to mitigate the risk of resistance.</p>

            <p>As tariffs reshape supply chains, consumers may increasingly check for the "Made in USA" label, but intricate trade rules and manufacturing networks complicate its meaning. The label requires that all or virtually all of a product, including parts and assembly, originate in the United States. However, exceptions exist, and bilateral trade agreements can override these rules. The article explores the nuances of country-of-origin labeling and the challenges of determining what truly qualifies as "Made in USA."</p>

            <p>Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut bacteria, has been linked to good health, with researchers noting it helps to maintain the gut barrier. This bacteria lives in the large intestine and survives off of mucin, the layer of mucus that covers the large intestine's surface. If there is an imbalance of A muciniphila in the gut, it can lead to problems with health. Diet also affects the bacteria, though indirectly, as it uses the carbohydrates extracted from fibre-rich foods.</p>
