          <p>The BBC has stated it regrets not cutting the live feed of Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set, where the singer led chants of "death to the IDF." The broadcaster is reviewing its live event guidelines following condemnation from the UK government and festival organizers, who called the comments appalling. In response to the controversy, which also saw the band's US visas revoked, the BBC affirmed its stance against incitement to violence and antisemitism, noting the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service.</p>

The Treasury Department has already issued guidance to encourage new investment in the country. The policy shift aligns with requests from regional allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who are seeking to normalize relations with Syria's new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill, which the CBO estimates will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit, faces unified opposition from Democrats, who plan to use the process to force politically difficult votes for the GOP.

          <p>Longtime CBS News producer Seyed Rahim Bathaei reports that the recent direct military conflict between Iran and Israel, while long anticipated, has fostered a surprising level of national unity within Iran. He observes that while Iranian society is divided, there is a shared desire to protect the nation's identity and pride from external threats. Bathaei expresses concern that the situation is heading towards "darker things," fearing that any effort to topple the Iranian government could lead to regional disaster. He believes the only solution is direct communication between Iranian and U.S. leaders to de-escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the 1967 murder and sexual assault of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, solving what is believed to be the UK's oldest cold case. Dunne was found strangled in her home nearly six decades ago, but the case remained unsolved despite a massive police effort. The breakthrough came when modern DNA testing linked semen from the original crime scene to Headley, a convicted felon with a history of similar attacks on elderly women. His palm print also matched one found at the scene, securing the conviction.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from a group of Los Angeles landlords who sought financial compensation for rent lost during the city's COVID-19 eviction moratorium. The landlords argued that the policy, which temporarily stripped them of their right to evict nonpaying tenants, constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property. Lower courts had dismissed the lawsuit, citing long-standing precedents that allow for the regulation of property. With Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissenting, the court's decision leaves in place the lower court rulings against the landlords' claim.</p>

This shift is driven by security concerns over data leaks and China's ties to Russia.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a popular outdoor cafe on the Gaza seafront has killed at least 20 Palestinians and wounded dozens more, according to medics and witnesses. The Al-Baqa Cafeteria, a well-known spot for journalists and residents to access the internet, was struck by what was reportedly a missile from a warplane. The attack came after a wave of overnight Israeli airstrikes across Gaza City that triggered mass displacement. This bombardment follows one of the largest evacuation orders since the war resumed, increasing pressure on all parties to reach a ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Declines to Hear Case of Teacher Fired for Social Media Posts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 09:52:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal from a Massachusetts teacher, Kari MacRae, who was fired over social media posts she made before she was hired. MacRae claimed her termination was retaliation for expressing her views and violated her First Amendment rights. The posts were characterized by school officials as containing homophobic, transphobic, and racist themes. A lower court had sided with the school district, ruling that the potential for disruption to the learning environment justified the firing. The Supreme Court's decision leaves that ruling in place.</p>
