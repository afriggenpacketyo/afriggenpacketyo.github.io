          <p>Several British newspapers are covering Chancellor Rachel Reeves's reversal on winter fuel payments after facing criticism for initially cutting them. The papers highlight the political fallout and potential tax implications of the U-turn. Additionally, many papers are reporting on Labour's commitment to invest £14 billion in the Sizewell C nuclear plant, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create jobs. The newspapers are also covering Greta Thunberg's detention in Israel and the increasing number of Britons seeking alternative spiritual solace outside traditional religion.</p>

          <p>Kyiv, Ukraine, experienced a relentless barrage of drones and missiles overnight, with residents reporting numerous explosions. ABC News estimates that dozens of drones were launched towards the capital, and while many were intercepted, some reached their targets, causing fires in multiple districts. Authorities have confirmed at least two injuries as a result of the attacks. This event follows a large-scale Russian drone attack on regions throughout Ukraine the previous day, and Russia and Ukraine recently held the first stage of a prisoner swap following peace talks in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who expressed concerns about the UK's potential complicity in Israel's actions in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff had questioned continued arms sales and what they viewed as a disregard for international law by Israel. Senior civil servants responded that while healthy challenge was encouraged, resignation was an "honourable course" for those with fundamental disagreements. This response has been met with frustration among officials who feel the space for challenging policy is shrinking.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in global fertility rates, citing the high cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key factors. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries and found that one in five had fewer children than desired. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to having more children, with the highest response in Korea. The report marks a shift in the UN's focus towards addressing low fertility issues.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have dramatically decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. Provisional data from the CDC indicates that fatal overdoses in this age group fell from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. While the trend is promising, challenges remain in addressing addiction among those already struggling with it.</p>
