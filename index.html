          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall have resulted in significant casualties across South Korea, with the government reporting at least 14 deaths and 12 people missing. The severe weather caused landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, particularly in southern regions which received up to 800 millimeters of rain. Incidents included a house collapse and individuals being swept away by swollen streams. In response to the disaster, approximately 3,840 people have been evacuated from their homes, though the rain has now subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted.</p>

          <p>Greek and Turkish Cypriots observed the 51st anniversary of the 1974 Turkish invasion that divided the island of Cyprus. In the south, Greek Cypriots commemorated the event with air raid sirens and memorial services, while in the north, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attended celebrations in the breakaway state. The event highlights the deep-rooted division and ongoing geopolitical tensions between NATO allies Greece and Turkey. Despite repeated failures in reunification efforts, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted that discussions on trust-building measures will continue.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of reducing sewage discharges by water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This pledge follows a significant public outcry and recent data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also aims to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and cut phosphorus pollution, which harms wildlife. While the government frames this as a decisive action, critics point out the target is not legally binding and comes amid rising water bills to fund a £104 billion infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>A severe summer drought on Suva Planina in southeastern Serbia has depleted natural water sources, endangering over 1,000 cows and horses and prompting authorities to deliver emergency water supplies. The drought, which began in May, is part of a broader climate issue affecting the Western Balkans, leading to water restrictions and agricultural damage across the region. Farmers report that springs have dried up months earlier than usual, causing panic among livestock. This event underscores the growing vulnerability of the region to climate change, as scientists warn of increasing heat and dryness in Europe.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals reported missing after the devastating July 4 floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies who successfully verified the safety of many people initially unaccounted for. At its peak, over 160 people were listed as missing in the county. While this news is a source of profound relief, the overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

Gwozdz alleged her husband used an Elmer Fudd voice to indicate his gun was unloaded, prompting her to "fan fire" the weapon, resulting in his death. However, investigators discovered he was shot twice, and firearms experts testified that fan firing the double-action revolver used would be extremely difficult for an amateur. After an initial mistrial, a second jury convicted her of second-degree murder, questioning the credibility of her cartoon-based defense.</p>

Shipments rose to 353 metric tons, signaling a recovery in the trade of these critical minerals used in electric vehicles and wind turbines. This increase comes after China had placed several rare earth items on an export restriction list, causing a sharp drop in shipments in April and May and disrupting global supply chains. Analysts expect the flow of these materials to continue recovering as more Chinese exporters secure the necessary licenses. (not investment advice)</p>

The investigation then shifted after DNA from the crime scene was matched to George Steven Burch.

It criticizes political leaders and the public in various nations for their moral deficiencies, denial, or apathy regarding war crimes.

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu suffered a significant career setback with a seventh-round TKO loss to Sebastian Fundora in their world title rematch in Las Vegas. This marks Tszyu's third defeat in his last four fights, leaving his future in the super-welterweight division uncertain. Fundora dominated the bout, using his significant height and reach advantage to control the fight and open a severe cut over Tszyu's eye. Despite showing courage, Tszyu's corner stopped the fight, with Tszyu graciously acknowledging Fundora as the superior fighter on the night.</p>

          <h2>United States to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Many Travelers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is slated to begin with the 2025 fiscal year. According to the provision, travelers may be able to get the fee reimbursed after their visa expires if they comply with all visa conditions. However, significant questions remain about the implementation process, and experts advise clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable due to the expected difficulty in obtaining reimbursements.

          <p>Animal rescue volunteers discovered a "distressing and alarming" situation in a South Los Angeles home, finding over 400 guinea pigs living in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions. Many of the animals were suffering from medical issues like ringworm and open wounds, with some found deceased, and they lacked proper food and water. The rescue was initiated after the tenant, facing eviction, was reported to be hoarding the animals. Rescue groups are now urgently seeking public assistance for fostering, adoption, and donations to cover the extensive medical and supply costs for the surviving guinea pigs.</p>
