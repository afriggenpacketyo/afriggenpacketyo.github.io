          <p>House Republicans faced significant internal division while trying to advance President Trump's major domestic policy agenda ahead of a self-imposed deadline. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence in passing the bill, which includes large tax cuts and increased border security spending, despite opposition from both conservative and moderate factions within his party. The leadership engaged in intense negotiations and kept a crucial procedural vote open for an extended period to persuade holdouts, highlighting the party's fragile majority and the difficulty in unifying its members on the legislation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's signature tax-and-spending legislation encountered a major obstacle in the House as Republican leaders failed to secure enough votes for a crucial procedural rule. At least five Republicans voted against advancing the bill, a number sufficient to block it from reaching the floor for a final vote. The opposition stemmed from both hardline conservatives and moderates who were displeased with changes made in the Senate version, particularly concerning deeper cuts to Medicaid. This development placed the bill's passage in serious jeopardy, as any new amendments would require it to be sent back to the Senate.</p>

          <p>The United States government has lifted its export restrictions on electronic design automation (EDA) software to China, as confirmed by leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This move reverses a policy enacted in May that required U.S. companies to obtain licenses before exporting critical chip-design technology. The decision allows major players in the U.S.-dominated EDA market, including a subsidiary of Siemens, to restore access for their customers in China. This policy shift signals a potential de-escalation amid ongoing trade discussions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New York acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Combs, who had been detained since his arrest, will remain in custody pending his sentencing, which is proposed for October.

          <p>This article provides context on congressional procedure, explaining what happens when a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives results in a tie. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or piece of legislation ends in a tie, the measure is considered lost and fails to pass. This rule becomes particularly relevant in times of a very narrow majority, where a few defections from the controlling party can easily lead to a legislative stalemate or defeat.</p>

          <p>A piece of a wing flap that went missing from a Delta Air Lines jet was discovered in the driveway of a home in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Boeing 737, carrying 109 passengers and six crew members, had landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on a flight from Atlanta when a post-flight inspection revealed the part was gone. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the part belonged to the aircraft and has launched an investigation into the incident. No injuries were reported, and the safe landing averted a potentially dangerous situation.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that broadly restricted migrants who cross the southern border from being able to seek asylum. In a detailed order, Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws passed by Congress. The judge stayed the decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal. Civil rights groups praised the ruling as a critical affirmation of the right to seek asylum.</p>

A large-scale firefighting response, including ground crews, helicopters, and additional reinforcements, is underway to contain the blaze.

          <p>President Donald Trump intensified his public criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve, explicitly calling for its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign immediately. In a social media post, Trump linked to an article about a potential investigation into Powell, whom Trump himself nominated for the position during his first term. The demand marks a significant escalation in the president's long-running campaign to pressure the independent central bank into lowering interest rates to boost economic growth. The move challenges established political norms regarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct presidential influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services has found that historical child sexual exploitation investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence provided by the city council.

Manchester City Council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules and the risk of jeopardizing prosecutions.

Political experts suggest this change is not necessarily an ideological move to the right but rather a reflection of growing populist sentiments and disillusionment with the Democratic Party. Analysts point to economic concerns and frustration over immigration policies as key drivers, arguing that both parties have failed to effectively address the priorities of this large and evolving demographic group.</p>
