          <h2>CNBC Survey Reveals Negative Views of Tesla and Elon Musk Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 14:38:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that approximately half of Americans hold a negative perception of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. This sentiment extends to investors, reflecting concerns about Musk's political activities and their potential impact on Tesla's brand. The survey highlights a polarization, with Democrats and independents showing significantly lower approval of Musk compared to Republicans. The findings suggest that Tesla's challenges may stem from a disconnect between public support for electric vehicles and the company's specific image, particularly among potential EV buyers. Optimism score: 40 (not investment advice)</p>
