          <p>A Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer, the Takanami, sailed through the Taiwan Strait last week, marking the third such passage in the past year. This action is viewed as a warning to China, which continues to exert pressure on Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island claimed by China. The transit occurred days after a close encounter between a Chinese fighter jet and a Japanese patrol plane. The Japanese government has historically avoided sending vessels through the strait to prevent provoking China, but has shifted its stance to assert freedom of navigation in international waters, aligning with the United States and other allies. The Chinese military reportedly tracked the Takanami's transit. The article does not include investment advice, and the summary focuses on the geopolitical implications of the event.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom recorded its hottest day of the year, with temperatures exceeding 30Â°C, prompting amber heat health alerts across England. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued warnings about increased pressures on health and social care services due to the heat. Temperatures are expected to rise further, potentially reaching 33Â°C over the weekend, driven by high pressure and a south-easterly wind drawing hot air from Western Europe. Fire services have issued water safety warnings, and health organizations are advising precautions for vulnerable individuals, with a change in wind direction expected to bring cooler temperatures on Sunday.
