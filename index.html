          <p>British actor John Alford, known for his role in "London's Burning," has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls. The incidents occurred at a friend's house in Hertfordshire in April 2022. The 53-year-old actor, whose real name is John Shannon, had denied the charges throughout the trial at St Albans Crown Court. Upon hearing the verdict, Alford expressed his disbelief in the courtroom, shouting that he was innocent and that the decision was wrong.</p>

          <p>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating the recent firings of at least 20 Justice Department employees who worked on cases related to former President Trump. In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the senators are demanding justification for the terminations, which they describe as a "pernicious abuse of power." The dismissed staff, including prosecutors, paralegals, and administrative personnel, were reportedly identified by a "weaponization working group" established by Bondi. The senators argue the firings are antidemocratic and possibly unlawful, aimed at undermining key investigations.</p>

His comments came shortly before the release of the August jobs report and follow President Trump's firing of former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer last month. Lutnick attributed potential past inaccuracies to "holdovers from the Biden administration" who he claimed were "rooting against America." He suggested that with new leadership, the agency would be more aligned with the administration's goal of producing correct numbers.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law banning the sale of cell-cultured meat in the state went into effect on September 1, a move praised by livestock industry leaders. Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill, which establishes a two-year moratorium on the products. However, the ban is already facing a constitutional challenge from the Institute for Justice and cultivated food producers Wildtype and UPSIDE Foods. The lawsuit argues that the ban infringes on consumer choice and economic liberty, setting up a legal battle over the future of synthetic food alternatives in the state.</p>

          <p>Ten years after the landmark detention of the "Feminist Five," China's feminist movement is navigating a paradoxical reality of increased public awareness and severe government crackdown. While issues like sexual harassment have gained visibility, authorities have systematically silenced feminist voices by banning social media accounts and dissolving online groups. The state frames feminism as a subversive Western ideology, leading to activists being targeted and victims of harassment facing countersuits. Despite the shrinking space for public discourse, activists express cautious hope, noting the movement's decentralized nature and continued resilience in challenging patriarchal norms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend the US Open men's singles final on Sunday, marking his first visit to the Grand Slam tennis tournament since 2015. Having been re-elected in 2024, this will be his first time attending the event in Flushing Meadows, Queens, since his initial term in office began. A White House official confirmed the president's expected attendance at the final. The finalists will be determined by Friday's matches between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner versus Felix Auger-Aliassime.</p>

          <p>Four Democratic senators have written to Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch, urging him to resist political interference from the White House. The letter follows President Trump's criticism of the institution as "WOKE" and a subsequent White House memo targeting 22 specific exhibitions for allegedly presenting a negative view of American history. The senators assert that Congress, not the executive branch, holds oversight authority over the Smithsonian, which is an independent federal trust. They expressed support for the institution's independence and its mission to tell the full story of America.</p>

An activist projected anti-communist slogans onto a high-rise building in Chongqing, an action inspired by other recent protests against the government's authority. While state media portrays unified public enthusiasm for the parade, which featured leaders from Russia and North Korea, commentators suggest a more divided sentiment exists privately.

The article argues that while rampant social media speculation is unhelpful, the lack of information from the White House and the media's reluctance to investigate create an information vacuum.

          <p>Gun rights organizations, led by Gun Owners of America (GOA), are advancing a strategy to dismantle the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934, which regulates items like machine guns, silencers, and short-barreled rifles. A recent legislative effort succeeded in removing the $200 tax on suppressors and short-barreled long guns through the budget reconciliation process. Following this partial victory, the GOA and other groups, including the NRA, have filed lawsuits aiming to overturn the NFA's remaining registration requirements for these items entirely.

This successful high-orbit refueling showcases a capability that could have dual-use military applications, such as servicing or disabling other satellites.

Adding to the concern, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its June figures downward, showing a loss of 13,000 jobs that month, the first monthly decline since late 2020. Economists attribute the slowdown to economic uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariffs, which has made businesses hesitant to hire.

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a key factor in affordability. As of early September, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.58%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.76%. Refinance rates are slightly higher, with a 30-year refinance averaging 6.73%. The article suggests that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers can improve their chances of securing a good rate by strengthening their credit profile and comparing offers from multiple lenders.

          <p>China's government has unveiled a new action plan aimed at strengthening its domestic electronics manufacturing sector and achieving greater self-sufficiency in its supply chains. The plan, issued by two key ministries, emphasizes the strategic importance of the industry for national security and economic stability. It calls for the development of advanced core technologies and mandates the increased use of domestically produced equipment to fill gaps in the supply chain. This move is a direct response to tightening U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology, signaling Beijing's determination to reduce its reliance on foreign components.</p>

          <p>An internal Department of Homeland Security memo reveals that the Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois will be used as a staging area for an upcoming immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago area. The memo indicates that the base will accommodate approximately 250 federal agents and 140 vehicles for "removal operations" over a 30-day period. This use of a military installation highlights the second Trump administration's unprecedented integration of the armed forces in its mass deportation efforts. The planned operations are expected to be led by agents from ICE and Customs and Border Protection.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan would award Musk 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones. These targets include reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization, delivering 20 million vehicles, and producing one million "robotaxis" and one million humanoid robots. The proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion pay package and aims to incentivize and retain Musk as CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Morningstar report reveals that actively managed funds struggled significantly to beat their passive index fund counterparts over the past year. Only 33% of active funds delivered higher returns than their index equivalents from July 2024 to June 2025, a period marked by market volatility where active managers often claim an advantage. The long-term data is even less favorable, with just 21% of active strategies surviving and outperforming over the last decade. The primary driver of this underperformance is the higher fees associated with active management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is taking place under a cloud of political pressure from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has denounced the movement's "globalist uniformity." This echoes the Nazi party's historical condemnation of Bauhaus as "degenerate art" before shutting it down in 1933. Despite the attacks, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its program focusing on the school's legacy of societal impact.</p>

          <p>India's finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has stated that the country will continue to purchase Russian oil because it is economically advantageous. This policy will persist despite the Trump administration imposing a 50% tariff on Indian goods, partly in response to these energy deals which Washington claims help fund Moscow's war in Ukraine. Since 2022, India has become the largest buyer of Russian seaborne crude, taking advantage of discounted prices. The minister emphasized that India's purchasing decisions are based on national interest, underscoring the country's independent economic policy.</p>
