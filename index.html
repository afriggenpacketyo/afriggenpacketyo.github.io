          <p>Following Anthony Albanese's re-election as Prime Minister, Australian markets experienced a downturn in early trading, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years, signaling Australians' desire for policy continuity amidst macroeconomic uncertainty. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.29%, reversing gains from the previous session. The Australian dollar also depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar. Most other Asian markets were closed for public holidays. U.S. futures also showed a slight decline after a strong week on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In recent elections in Canada and Australia, center-left parties have seen their fortunes revived, while right-wing parties that adopted Trumpian tactics have suffered losses, indicating a complex impact of President Trump on global politics. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney explicitly campaigned against Trump's policies, while Australian leader Anthony Albanese saw an anti-Trump bump, suggesting that voters consider Trump when making decisions. The article notes that in Germany, the effect has been less direct, but still felt. An unpredictable American president can have unpredictable consequences for leaders abroad, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain is fast discovering.</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes more popular, some experts warn against relying on it as a guaranteed solution for delayed motherhood due to the high costs and no guarantees, with a single cycle costing upwards of $12,000. Vardit Ravitsky from the Hastings Center argues that society pressures women to delay childbearing, and a better solution would be company policies supporting younger motherhood. The article also notes the increasing commercialization of fertility services, with private equity firms investing heavily in fertility clinics, raising concerns about warped incentives and pressure on doctors to generate more revenue.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among young women as a means of preserving their fertility, with the number of procedures having increased more than six times over from 2014 to 2023. Many women see it as a way to delay childbearing without compromising their chances of having children later in life. Experts note that the optimal age to freeze eggs is in one's 20s, as egg quality decreases with age. However, the procedure is expensive, costing an average of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees, and is not always covered by insurance.</p>

          <p>According to Savills, more than half of first-time buyers in the UK received financial assistance from their families to purchase homes last year, with an average contribution of £55,572. This trend is attributed to high mortgage rates and rising rental costs. The proportion of first-time buyers receiving family help was slightly lower than the previous year but higher than most years since 2013. First-time buyers are leveraging family support to secure better mortgage rates amidst challenging lending conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, known for his starring role as a comically genteel sheriff in the TV western "Sugarfoot," died at 94 due to respiratory failure. "Sugarfoot," which premiered in 1957, featured Hutchins as Tom Brewster, a law student who preferred cherry soda to whiskey and abhorred violence. After his Hollywood career waned, Hutchins became a traveling clown, performing around the world. He later worked as a shipping clerk at NBC and wrote essays about his experiences in show business.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 4% after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second month. The decision by the eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June followed a similar move in May. Rising tariffs and uncertainty in Mexico are constraining international upstream spending levels, leading to lower oil prices. Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. crude and Brent prices will average $59 and $63 per barrel, respectively, this year. (not investment advice)</p>
