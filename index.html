          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reaffirmed his country's unwavering support for Russia's war against Ukraine, as reported by state media following a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Kim stated that Pyongyang and Moscow share identical views on strategic issues and that North Korea is prepared to unconditionally back all measures taken by the Russian leadership. This declaration comes amid deepening military ties, with North Korea reportedly sending thousands of troops to Russia's Kursk region and supplying over 10 million artillery rounds and missiles. In exchange for this military assistance, Pyongyang is receiving economic cooperation and advanced military technology from Moscow, solidifying their alignment against Western-led coalitions.</p>

          <h2>Israeli Airstrike in Central Gaza Reportedly Kills Ten People, Including Six Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 05:02:28 EDT</div>

          <p>Emergency officials in Gaza report that an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed ten people, six of whom were children, as they were queuing for water in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The strike, allegedly from a drone, also injured 16 others, adding to a rising daily death toll from escalating Israeli attacks across the region. The incident highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where collapsing infrastructure and severe shortages of fuel, water, and medical supplies have left the population in a critical state. The ongoing conflict, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in immense civilian casualties and widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>The recent trilogy fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden serves as a powerful symbol for the evolution and complexities of women's boxing. The article contrasts the spectacle of the main event with the harsher realities faced by lesser-known female fighters, highlighting the sport's inherent contradictions. It argues that true equality in boxing is not just the right to be inspiring, but also the right to fight strategically, even if it results in a less thrilling match. The piece reflects on the fighters' call for the choice to compete in 12 three-minute rounds, framing it as a reclamation of their bodies for risk and glory, not just for traditional roles.</p>

          <p>Talks are scheduled for next week between UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the British Medical Association (BMA) in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has stated the walkout, set to begin on July 25, will only be suspended if the government presents a credible pay offer that addresses the real-terms pay decline since 2008. While the government has offered a 5.4% increase for this year, it insists it cannot improve the offer, though it is reportedly open to discussing better working conditions. Public support for the strikes has notably decreased, and the potential industrial action raises concerns about its impact on patient care and NHS waiting lists.</p>

Found in Niger in November 2023, its Martian origin was confirmed by a specialized lab that compared its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe.

Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the 1985 concert featured an unprecedented lineup of rock stars and set a new template for charity mega-events. However, critics point to its significant flaws, including the lack of African performers and female artists, which reinforced a 'white savior' narrative and a patronizing image of Africa.

Personal stories highlight the danger, such as a child suffering a severe allergic reaction to a body wash.

The case culminated in the trial of Zachary Abell, where his former partner, Christina Araujo, testified against him after taking a plea deal.

An elite kindergarten in Harbin, once exclusive to officials' children, now recruits from the general public to fill its classrooms. This situation is reflective of a national trend, with China seeing a 13% drop in the number of kindergartens since 2020 and a 25.5% decrease in student enrollment over the same period.

Additionally, an in-home ADT camera showed Turner following an unarmed Trussler while appearing angry, and prosecutors argued it also showed a cut on her hand from the stabbing.

          <p>A 57-year-old farmworker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, has died after falling from a greenhouse roof while reportedly fleeing federal agents during a raid on a large cannabis operation in Ventura County, California. The incident has intensified tensions surrounding the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which have led to protests and confrontations. While the family of the deceased seeks justice, Homeland Security officials defended the raid, stating they detained over 300 individuals and were investigating potential child labor violations at the facility. The death and the chaotic nature of the raid have sparked significant controversy and legal challenges regarding the methods used by federal agents.</p>

          <p>As Russia's war on Ukraine continues into its 40th month, the prospect of a Ukrainian collapse is becoming an increasingly urgent and realistic question that the West must address. Despite Ukrainian heroism, the nation faces severe shortages of manpower and munitions, while Russia's relentless attacks and superior numbers create a daily existential struggle. The article argues that a Ukrainian defeat would represent a monumental strategic failure for the West, with daunting consequences for European security and international law. With Western support wavering and diplomatic solutions stalled, the piece calls for tougher NATO action, stricter sanctions, and a concerted effort to convince Russia that a negotiated peace is the only viable path forward.</p>

          <p>The investigation into a lead poisoning case at a kindergarten in China's Gansu province has been escalated, with provincial leaders and a task force from the State Council now involved.

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant political shift marked by the growing influence of Islamic-oriented parties, challenging the current government's more moderate stance. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the conservative Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial ground, particularly among younger and more conservative Malay voters. This 'green wave' is pushing for policies aligned with conservative Islamic ideology, such as stricter dress codes and the implementation of Islamic criminal law in states it controls. This trend poses a long-term challenge to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration and raises concerns about the future of the nation's multi-ethnic and multi-religious identity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study offers preliminary evidence that China's massive dam projects on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet may not cause the droughts in India that many have feared. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flow downstream during the dry season has actually increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This suggests that the dams regulate water, storing it during wet seasons and releasing it during dry periods, which could potentially alleviate rather than create water scarcity issues for downstream countries like India. The findings provide a new perspective on a highly contentious geopolitical and environmental issue.</p>

Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for entry, described the conditions as 'appalling,' citing extreme heat in the medical area, small food portions, and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction, with one senator claiming the beds were comfortable. The facility was constructed in just eight days, and officials have denied all accusations of poor conditions, stating it meets all required standards despite ongoing controversy and protests.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have voiced strong criticism of US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 30% tariff on their imports, set to take effect on August 1. Mexico labeled the proposal an "unfair deal," while EU chief Ursula von der Leyen warned of "proportionate countermeasures" if necessary, though both expressed a desire to continue negotiations. Trump has escalated the trade dispute by threatening even higher retaliatory tariffs if the trading partners impose their own duties. This move is part of a broader protectionist strategy that has also seen new tariffs announced for Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil, creating significant global trade friction.
