          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated sharply as both sides exchanged missile and drone attacks on military installations, each accusing the other of initiating hostilities. Pakistan reported that India targeted multiple air bases, prompting a retaliatory response with short-range missiles aimed at Indian airfields and storage facilities. India claimed to have struck radar sites and command centers within Pakistan, asserting it was responding to a wave of Pakistani attacks. Amidst the heightened conflict, the international community, including the United States, urges both nations to de-escalate and seek diplomatic resolutions to prevent further escalation and potential miscalculations. Civilians in border areas have been impacted by the exchanges, underscoring the urgent need for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</p>

          <p>Recent efforts to control silicosis, a deadly lung disease, have been undermined by the Trump administration's actions, including the firing of the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) team and NIOSH scientists. This article highlights the history of silicosis prevention efforts, including the establishment of OSHA and NIOSH. Despite OSHA’s new silica standard, MSHA’s standard remained outdated, and more miners were getting sick, particularly younger miners. Risk has been driven up by changes in mining practices, such as longer hours, the mining of seams that have less coal and more silica, and the use of new mining equipment that generates more dust.</p>

          <p>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets a ceiling on work, but not a floor. Over the past 20 years, however, employers have figured out a clever way to circumvent the FLSA, taking advantage of the fact that the law sets a ceiling on work, but not a floor. A survey of more than 6,000 Walmart employees conducted by the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group, found that 69 percent of part-time workers would like to be full-time. The FLSA worked as well as it did because it dealt with the two components of income—wages and hours—whereas efforts to raise the minimum wage alone, however well-intended, deal with only half of the equation. But for all of its virtues, the FLSA never contemplated the problem of underwork.</p>

          <p>An order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes in Catalonia, Spain, has been lifted after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine.

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) has filed a lawsuit against the German domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which recently labeled the far-right party as "confirmed right-wing extremist." The BfV complied with the AfD's request to follow a so-called "standstill commitment" (Stillhaltezusage), meaning that the agency is putting its official reclassification of the AfD as a right-wing extremist party on hold. This classification "confirmed right-wing extremist" was not withdrawn. The AfD's claim that the BfV has effectively "withdrawn" the party's classification as "confirmed right-wing extremist" is false.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intent of landing on Venus, made its return to Earth after spending 53 years in space due to a failed booster. The spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and likely landed in the Indian Ocean, serving as a stark reminder of the Cold War era's ambitious space exploration endeavors. This event highlights the Soviet Union's focus on Venus during the space race, with the Venera program achieving significant milestones such as the first landing on another planet and transmission of alien landscape images. While the re-entry is a unique historical event, it also underscores the increasing frequency of space debris returning to Earth due to heightened solar activity and increased launches, posing potential hazards.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supply chains, aiming to deter foreign powers from disrupting China's access to essential goods. This approach involves increasing exports, providing state-backed loans to industries, and implementing economic warfare tactics such as export controls. China's dominance in critical minerals and manufacturing has allowed it to retaliate against trade measures imposed by the United States, creating pressure on the Trump administration. However, this strategy has strained relationships with trading partners and comes at a cost to Chinese households, while also relying on Western technology. The global competition between China and the United States is intensifying, potentially dividing the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>With President Trump signaling a potential pullback of U.S. support for Ukraine, European nations are struggling to provide adequate military assistance to Kyiv. European leaders are concerned about their capacity to meet Ukraine's urgent needs for weapons and air defense systems, especially as they also need to rearm themselves. This situation has prompted Ukraine to seek alternative revenue sources, such as giving the U.S. a share of future revenue over natural resources, to maintain access to American arms. Despite European efforts to increase weapons production, it will take time to ramp up assembly lines, leaving Ukraine reliant on continued U.S. support to defend against Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), has been introduced to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances, allowing for more evidence-based policymaking. The bill aims to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that hinder federal funding for research on Schedule I substances. While rescheduling cannabis faces political hurdles, the EBDPA is viewed as a modest but meaningful step forward. The bill could lead to increased research on cannabis's medical uses, appropriate dosages, and the long-term impacts of different consumption methods.</p>

          <p>The Trump White House has launched an aggressive media strategy characterized by crass language, flashy tactics, and outrageous social media posts. This approach aims to directly engage the MAGA base and bypass traditional media outlets, often embracing viral far-right culture. The White House has shared bizarre content, including AI-generated images of Trump as the pope and videos of shackled migrants being loaded onto planes. This strategy has nurtured a parallel information ecosystem through pro-Trump outlets enjoying a significant growth in influence and access to power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus, the right of a person to challenge their detention in court, particularly in cases related to immigration. Stephen Miller, a White House aide, cited the Constitution's provision for suspension during "rebellion or invasion." This move is seen as a response to judges challenging recent detentions by the administration. The legal right has been suspended four times in US history: during the American Civil War under Abraham Lincoln, in Hawaii following the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, in the Philippines during US ownership in 1905, and while combat the activities of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group in the 19th Century.</p>

Supporters call them common-sense measures to safeguard tax dollars, promote fairness and respond to public opinion.
