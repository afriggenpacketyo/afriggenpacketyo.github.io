          <p>A stampede during the annual Shri Lairai Zatra festival in Goa, India, resulted in the deaths of six people and injuries to over 50 others. The incident occurred amid a large gathering of devotees from Goa and neighboring states, witnessing religious ceremonies, with the frenzy of the rituals triggering the stampede. Despite a heavy security presence, authorities are still investigating the exact cause, with initial reports suggesting a fall on a steep slope may have initiated the chaos. Political leaders have expressed condolences and promised support to the affected families following the tragedy which is relatively common during Indian religious festivals.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies from his blood have shown the ability to protect against fatal doses from various snake species in animal trials. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, inspired by the high number of deaths and disabilities caused by snakebites worldwide. Researchers identified broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that target common elements across different toxins, leading to the creation of a cocktail that protected mice from fatal doses of venom from 13 of 19 deadly snake species.</p>

          <p>Residents of Zamzam Camp in Darfur, Sudan, recount the atrocities committed by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) during a three-day rampage that resulted in at least 400 deaths. The attack, the worst in the camp's 20-year history, involved fighters gunning down civilians, torturing victims, and committing acts of sexual assault. The attack occurred after months of famine caused by an RSF siege, during which residents were forced to eat grass and leaves to survive. The RSF has denied targeting civilians, claiming the camp was used as a military base, however, witnesses detail horrific violence and destruction.</p>

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is struggling with declining tourist numbers due to souring relations between Taiwan and mainland China. Visitor figures have dropped significantly, with only 50,000 visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau last year, compared to 3.32 million in 2016. The museum is aiming for 3.5 million visitors in its centenary year, but faces challenges due to political factors and tourism policy changes. The largest overseas group of visitors in 2024 came from South Korea, followed by Japan, highlighting the impact of strained cross-strait relations on tourism.</p>

The fight was criticized for its lack of action, with both fighters hesitant to over-commit. With Romero's victory, the potential Haney rematch is now uncertain.</p>

Sherrill also discussed how Democrat-led states could challenge Trumpâ€™s agenda, emphasizing the importance of federalism and state-level actions. Earlier in the week, Rep.

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, as well as complex international relations with the U.S. and China. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living issues, with both major parties offering small-scale solutions. The election also reflects a shift away from the two major parties, with voters turning to independent candidates and minor parties, signaling dissatisfaction with the traditional political landscape. The opposition leader's adoption of some Trump-like policies initially seemed promising but has since become a liability.</p>

This overhaul is also intended to address dysfunction caused by the country's anti-corruption campaign and to strengthen political governance in the face of external pressures. These changes are occurring ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in January 2026, potentially allowing the top leadership to exert more direct control over local affairs.</p>

The lawsuit argues that these policies interfere with federal immigration law enforcement and violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The suit references claims that a Venezuelan gang took over an apartment complex in Aurora due to these policies, although local officials dispute the extent of the gang's control. Local officials have vowed to defend their policies, while the governor's office maintains that Colorado is not a sanctuary state.</p>

          <p>The US has imposed a 25% import tax on key car parts, intensifying pressure on the automotive industry amidst policy changes. While Donald Trump eased the measure in response to business concerns, the tariffs aim to incentivize domestic manufacturing. Analysts predict that expansions in the US will likely come at the expense of production elsewhere, leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Companies have been temporarily shielded from the impact due to a sales surge driven by concerns about price hikes, but warnings of increased costs and uncertainties persist.</p>

          <p>President Trump's elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods from China is expected to significantly impact low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein, as well as tech giants like Meta and Alphabet. The exemption had allowed goods valued at less than $800 to enter the U.S. without import taxes, fueling a surge in online advertising. Temu and Shein have already begun to pull back on advertising spending, and their apps have fallen in download rankings. This change is expected to reduce revenue for companies that relied on the tariff loophole.</p>

          <p>Ghana's national cathedral project, initiated by former President Nana Akufo-Addo, has stalled and become a symbol of economic mismanagement and corruption. The project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has consumed around $58 million in public funds but remains an unfinished hole in the ground. The new government has halted funding and launched an anticorruption initiative targeting the project. The cathedral, intended as a national monument and a unifier for Ghanaian Christians, has failed to attract widespread support amid the country's economic struggles.</p>

          <p>The United States has implemented 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump, aim to promote domestic manufacturing. The tariffs will not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that meet the requirements of the North American trade agreement. Automakers and suppliers have warned that relocating assembly lines will take years and involve significant costs, creating uncertainty within the industry.
