          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced its decision to impose anti-dumping tariffs on brandy imported from the European Union, a move that primarily affects French cognac producers. The ministry stated that its investigation found evidence of dumping, which poses a material threat to China's domestic brandy industry. The new tariffs, which range from 27.7% to 34.9%, are set to take effect immediately. This action represents a significant development in the trade relationship between China and the EU, impacting a key European luxury export.</p>

Suggestions have moved beyond traditional historical figures to include themes like maritime heritage, famous landmarks, classic television characters, and nature. While some prefer to continue honoring notable people, others question the necessity of a major redesign in an increasingly cashless society. This public consultation reflects a modern approach to currency design, engaging citizens in shaping national symbols.</p>

          <p>Heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath are set to perform a final farewell concert in their hometown of Birmingham with the original lineup. The event is particularly significant for frontman Ozzy Osbourne, whose life and career have been marked by both immense success and profound personal struggles, including substance abuse and recent health issues. After being fired from the band in 1979, Osbourne launched a successful solo career and became a pop culture icon. This last show, with proceeds going to local charities, serves as a historic conclusion to the band's influential legacy.</p>

          <p>Ukraine experienced one of its most intensive aerial bombardments, with Russia launching a record 550 drones and 11 missiles overnight. The capital, Kyiv, was the primary target, suffering widespread damage and resulting in at least 23 injuries, according to Ukrainian authorities. The attack occurred just hours after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, where Trump expressed disappointment over the lack of progress toward ending the war. This escalation highlights the ongoing volatility and the immense challenges facing diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs has reported that the UK Home Office cannot confirm whether foreign workers on skilled worker visas are leaving the country or remaining illegally after their permits expire. The Public Accounts Committee criticized the department for failing to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020. With over a million people having applied through this route, the report highlights a significant gap in immigration monitoring and accuses the Home Office of being slow to address the exploitation of workers. The government has acknowledged inheriting a "broken" system and pledged to implement reforms.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that he has developed an understanding of President Donald Trump by finding common ground on shared family values. In a recent interview, Starmer revealed that their good personal relationship, which included a condolence call from Trump after his brother's death, was instrumental in securing a vital trade deal on US tariffs. Despite their different political backgrounds, Starmer emphasized the importance of forging such international ties in the national interest. He denied that focusing on foreign affairs caused him to lose sight of domestic issues like the recent welfare reform controversy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is a major legislative package that funds many of his core campaign promises. The bill includes significant tax cuts for individuals and businesses, a massive increase in funding for immigration control and defense, and a rollback of clean energy initiatives in favor of fossil fuels. However, it is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt, raising concerns among fiscal conservatives. Additionally, changes to health and social programs like Medicaid and SNAP could cause millions to lose coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A jury in Clackamas County, Oregon, has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault. The charges stemmed from an incident in October 2021, where he assaulted a 21-year-old woman at a party hosted by a then-teammate from the Portland Trail Blazers. Prosecutors successfully argued the woman was incapacitated from heavy drinking and unable to give consent, while the defense countered that the encounter was consensual. The district attorney's office stated the verdict shows that celebrity status does not prevent prosecution for criminal acts in the county.</p>
