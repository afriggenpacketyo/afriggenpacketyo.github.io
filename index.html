            <p>China's consumer prices declined for the second consecutive month, while producer price deflation deepened, signaling rising deflationary pressures amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) slid 0.1% year-on-year in March, while Producer Prices fell 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Despite these pressures, core inflation rose slightly, and the Chinese government is expected to implement stimulus measures to boost domestic consumption. The ongoing trade war, highlighted by increased tariffs from both the U.S. and China, is expected to further disrupt the Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Despite expectations of economic hardship due to the escalating tariff war between the U.S. and China, many Chinese citizens are expressing firm support for Beijing's retaliatory measures. The new tariffs, raised to 125% by the U.S., have ignited anger across China, with many voicing defiance and a determination to withstand the economic pressures. While acknowledging the potential risks and challenges, Chinese citizens emphasize the need for China to stand firm and not retreat in the face of U.S. pressure, reflecting a sense of national pride and resilience. This sentiment highlights the complex dynamics of the trade war and its impact on public opinion.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Library of Congress has added José Alfredo Jiménez's iconic song "El Rey," immortalized by Vicente Fernández, to the National Recording Registry. This distinction recognizes its cultural, aesthetic, and historical significance to the United States' heritage. While originally written and performed by Jiménez in 1971, it gained widespread popularity through Fernández's 1973 rendition. Freddy Fender's "Before the Next Teardrop Falls," featuring Spanish verses, was also included in the registry, underscoring the impact of Mexican-American musical contributions.</p>

            <p>Analysts warn that despite President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, the situation remains volatile due to the ongoing trade war with China. The tariffs on Chinese imports have been raised to 125%, deepening the rift between the two largest economies. Experts caution that this does not signify a shift in Trump's overall objectives, and the threat of higher tariffs will persist. The escalating trade tensions are expected to disrupt global supply chains and cause economic pain for multiple countries. (not investment advice)</p>
