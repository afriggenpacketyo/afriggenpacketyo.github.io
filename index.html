          <p>Violent protests erupted in Makassar, Indonesia, following the death of a motorcycle taxi driver who was run over by a police vehicle. Demonstrators set a local council building on fire, resulting in the deaths of three people trapped inside and injuring at least four others. The incident has sparked wider unrest, with protests also occurring in the capital, Jakarta, outside the headquarters of the paramilitary police unit involved. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has promised a thorough investigation into the driver's death and urged for calm, marking a significant early test for his new administration amid public discontent over budget cuts.</p>

The termination followed an investigation into multiple incidents where Baxter reportedly bragged about her actions to security guards. In a statement, Bondi emphasized a commitment to President Trump's agenda and respect for law enforcement, warning that employees opposing the department's mission would be dismissed. This action follows the recent firing of another DOJ paralegal accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal officer, occurring amidst an increased federal law enforcement presence in the city.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, ending a difficult contract stalemate that he described as the "hardest four months" of his life. The Packers secured Parsons by sending two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas, subsequently signing Parsons to a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons expressed his ambition to build a legacy in Green Bay, similar to franchise legends like Reggie White. The move provides the Packers with a much-needed elite pass rusher but presents future salary cap challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's recent loss to a lower-league team has highlighted the ongoing struggles under manager Ruben Amorim, despite significant summer spending on new players. An analysis of his tactical system reveals that his rigid 5-2-3 positional play, which relies on creating numerical overloads, is frequently countered by opponents using man-to-man marking. The system discourages individual dribbling and relies on specific passing patterns, which become predictable and less effective against well-organized defenses. Defensively, the team's two-midfielder setup is often outnumbered, leading to a loss of control in games and raising questions about whether Amorim must adapt his methods for the Premier League.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 02:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the world's most sanctioned nations, North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volume more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. This surge has made North Korea the second-largest buyer of Chinese bottled wine by volume, trailing only Hong Kong.

          <p>EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced that Russian assets frozen by the bloc will not be returned to Moscow until reparations for the war in Ukraine have been paid. Speaking before a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Kallas emphasized this condition for any potential ceasefire or peace agreement. The European Union has frozen approximately €210 billion in Russian assets, and while Ukraine and some member states advocate for their confiscation to aid Kyiv, major powers like France and Germany have raised legal concerns. The debate is now shifting towards how these funds might be utilized once the conflict concludes.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men under the age of 22 to travel abroad, reversing a wartime policy that restricted men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country. The government's stated goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and employment overseas, with the hope that they will use their acquired experience to aid in the nation's future development. However, some experts are concerned the change will exacerbate brain drain, predicting that few who leave will return. This policy shift addresses fears among young people and their families about being unable to leave once they reached military age.</p>

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the government must afford due process rights to individuals who were not previously subject to this expedited removal process, which allows for deportation without a judicial hearing. The administration had sought to apply the policy to migrants who have been in the U.S. for less than two years, a significant expansion from its previous use near the border. The judge's opinion called the government's argument that such individuals are entitled to no process "truly startling."</p>

          <h2>Scenic Section of Angeles Crest Highway Reopens After Years of Storm Damage Repairs</h2>

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Severe weather in 2022 and 2023 caused rock slides and pavement collapses, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening restores access to popular hiking trails and is expected to alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads, though officials have issued extreme fire danger warnings for the holiday weekend, prohibiting all open flames in the area.</p>

          <p>Police arrested three men during a protest outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, England, after a court overturned an injunction that had blocked its use for housing asylum seekers. The arrests were for offenses including violent disorder and assaulting a police officer, with two officers sustaining minor injuries. The Court of Appeal's decision, which allows 138 asylum seekers to remain at the hotel, was met with protests and mixed reactions from the community. The situation reflects ongoing tensions in the town, where a previous arrest of an asylum seeker on charges including sexual assault has heightened local feelings.</p>

          <p>A non-sworn employee of the Los Angeles Police Department's security services division accidentally shot himself with his personal firearm at City Hall East.

The LAPD's Internal Affairs division is handling the investigation into the unintentional discharge, which occurred in the building's lobby. City Hall East, which houses offices for the city attorney and controller, was temporarily cordoned off following the event as investigators secured the scene and gathered information about the circumstances of the accidental shooting.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Many of President Trump's Tariffs Are Illegal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 21:10:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the broad tariffs imposed by President Trump are not legally permissible, dealing a significant blow to his trade policies. The court found that the president exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that the law does not grant unlimited power to impose tariffs. While the ruling upholds a lower court's decision on the illegality of the tariffs, it does not immediately block them and instead asks the lower court to reevaluate if a universal injunction is appropriate. The Trump administration has vowed to appeal the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Borges, the chief data officer for the Social Security Administration, has resigned days after filing a whistleblower complaint. His complaint alleged that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency had uploaded the entire country's Social Security data to a "vulnerable cloud environment." The SSA refuted this claim, stating the data was secure and not compromised. In his resignation letter, Borges cited retaliation and a hostile work environment that made it impossible for him to perform his duties legally and ethically, claiming his departure was a "constructive discharge."</p>

          <h2>Satellite Imagery Reveals Earthen Wall Being Built Around Besieged Sudanese City of El-Fasher</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 21:02:45 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers at Yale University have identified over 31 kilometers of newly constructed earthen walls, or berms, surrounding the besieged city of el-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region. The analysis of satellite images suggests the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are building the barrier to trap civilians and tighten their siege on the city, which is the last army stronghold in the region. The construction deepens the humanitarian crisis by restricting escape routes and access for aid. The RSF is also accused of intensifying its offensive and deliberately targeting civilian areas and hospitals within the city.</p>
