          <p>UCLA defeated Murray State in their College World Series opener, securing a 6-4 victory.  The Bruins overcame a slow start, breaking through with a four-run inning in the fourth.  Michael Barnett's solid pitching performance and the bullpen's ability to hold on secured the win for UCLA.  UCLA will play the winner of the LSU-Arkansas game in their next match.</p>
