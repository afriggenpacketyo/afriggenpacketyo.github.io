          <p>During a meeting with wounded veterans in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump noticed a "Let's Go Brandon" sticker on one of the veteran's belongings. Trump inquired about the sticker, prompting the veteran to reveal it was a picture of Joe Biden accompanied by the phrase. The phrase originated from a 2021 NASCAR interview where a reporter misheard a crowd chanting an anti-Biden sentiment. The moment brought lightheartedness to the meeting, followed by heartfelt gratitude from the veterans for Trump's administration and his love for America.</p>

The poll highlights economic issues as a driving factor, with disapproval of Trump's handling of the economy, inflation, and tariffs outweighing approval.

          <p>Chinese robot manufacturers are largely unaffected by US tariffs due to their dominance in the market and lack of international competition. Dolphin Robot Technology, for example, has seen overwhelming enthusiasm for its automated cafe at a trade expo, despite rising US duties. The company is not bearing the tariff or lowering prices because US customers have rigid demand and there are no comparable products produced in the US, Germany, or Japan at a competitive price.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive actions aimed at reshaping education, including efforts to rein in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education. One order targets college accreditors, alleging they have abused their authority by imposing discriminatory DEI-based standards. Another promises new discipline guidance for K-12 schools, aiming to base policies on objective behavior rather than DEI. These actions reflect Trump's conservative agenda and aim to roll back policies from the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, accusing him of harming peace negotiations. Trump suggested that a deal to end the war was "very close" but that Zelensky's stance would prolong the conflict. This statement hints at the possibility of the US formally recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea as part of a peace agreement, a move that would contradict international legal norms and face strong opposition from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Over six million illegal vaping products have been seized in England over the past three years, prompting a crackdown on the illicit trade. These products often contain excessive nicotine levels or lack proper labeling, posing health risks to consumers. Trading Standards officers are actively searching for these illegal vapes, which are often hidden in sophisticated ways. The upcoming ban on single-use disposable vapes is expected to improve the situation, as these products are a major driver of the illegal trade.</p>
