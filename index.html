          <p>The Arkansas Department of Corrections has released a possible updated headshot of Grant Hardin, the former police chief of Gateway, Arkansas, who escaped from prison on May 25. The image aims to reflect how Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," might look now, as the search continues in north central Arkansas. Hardin was serving a decades-long sentence for murder and sexual assault. Authorities are using tips from the public to guide their search efforts, and a reward for information leading to his capture has increased to $25,000. The investigation into the escape is ongoing to determine if he had any assistance.</p>

          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is considering the nomination of Michael Boren to lead the U.S. Forest Service, despite his history of conflicts with the agency. Boren, an investment consultant and ranch owner, has had disputes with the Forest Service regarding building a cabin, diverting a stream, and mining claims within the Sawtooth National Forest. During the hearing, Boren addressed these disputes, acknowledging some disagreements but emphasizing his commitment to making forest management more resilient and healthy. If confirmed, Boren would be responsible for day-to-day operations at the U.S. Forest Service, managing approximately 200 million acres of public land.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering an interim step in Iran nuclear talks that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels. This proposal aims to create a temporary arrangement while a broader agreement is worked out to block Iran's path to developing nuclear weapons. The details of this interim step are still under discussion, but it signals a potential shift in the administration's approach to nuclear negotiations with Iran. The goal is to establish a framework that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon while allowing for continued diplomatic efforts to reach a comprehensive and lasting agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific leaders are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, a strategy reminiscent of Cold War realpolitik, to balance and maneuver between major powers. This approach involves leveraging trade, investment, and technology to build influence and reduce dependency without fully committing to any single side. While triangular diplomacy offers agility and tactical scope, it also carries the risk of entanglements that could escalate instability. The article draws parallels to Henry Kissinger's use of triangular diplomacy in the 1970s to bolster America's power by exploiting the Sino-Soviet rivalry.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has announced the lifting of the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a punishment for past misdeeds. This restriction had prevented the bank from growing key business lines for years, but the removal now allows Wells Fargo to increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division. CEO Charlie Scharf and his team have worked to improve risk and controls, leading to the clearing of 14 consent orders. While other elements of the 2018 order remain in place, the removal of the asset cap is a significant milestone for the bank and its shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

Musk, who recently left the administration after working on government efficiency, expressed his disapproval of the bill's spending allocations.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering long-standing U.S. immigration policy. The proposed changes would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe difficult to meet given current backlogs. Even if the processing average is achieved, asylum-seekers would be required to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit.

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with legal action and fines over its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports consistent with their gender identity. This follows a transgender student, AB Hernandez, winning two high school track-and-field events under new rules. The Justice Department alleges that the California Interscholastic Federation's (CIF) policies are "unconstitutional" and deprive female students of athletic opportunities. President Trump singled out Hernandez, stating that "large scale fines" will be imposed on the state, as the California Attorney General's office is reviewing the letter and monitoring the situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming several naval ships named after civil rights leaders, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents suggest the name changes are intended to realign the U.S. military with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture." Other vessels under consideration for renaming include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman. The decision has sparked criticism, with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi calling it a "shameful, vindictive erasure."</p>
