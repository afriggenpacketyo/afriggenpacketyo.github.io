          <p>A review of UK Sunday newspapers highlights widespread coverage of a pro-Palestine Action protest in London, which saw numerous arrests including an 89-year-old woman and a former Guantanamo Bay detainee. Other prominent stories include government plans to deport foreign criminals more quickly, a policy welcomed by some for its cost-saving potential. Additionally, Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick expressed safety concerns for his family due to the small boats crisis, citing a rise in asylum-seeker sex crimes. The Sun on Sunday reports on Liam Gallagher supporting his brother, who is facing sexual assault charges.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, key European allies have jointly insisted that any peace agreement must involve Ukraine. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and others stated that Ukraine's path to peace cannot be decided without its participation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed this, calling any deal made without Kyiv's involvement a "dead decision." The diplomatic push comes amid concerns that Trump might broker a deal that cedes Ukrainian territory to Russia, a suggestion he has floated publicly, creating significant international tension.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell demonstrated a powerful return from a four-month injury recovery, striking out ten batters over five scoreless innings in a 9-1 win against the Toronto Blue Jays. The two-time Cy Young award winner's performance underscores the strength of the Dodgers' now fully intact starting rotation. The team's offense was bolstered by home runs from Max Muncy and Shohei Ohtani, whose 40th homer of the season was a notable highlight. This victory strengthens the Dodgers' position as they head towards the postseason with a formidable pitching staff.</p>

          <p>A new six-episode documentary, "Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang," has been released by a provincial Chinese broadcaster to reinforce Beijing's historical narrative regarding the Xinjiang region. The production focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who quelled a separatist state, aiming to bolster President Xi Jinping's goal of forging a strong national identity. This documentary is part of a broader effort by the Chinese government to assert its perspective on the governance of its borderlands. It specifically frames the historical conflict as a fight against a foreign-backed jihadist invasion, countering Western accounts.</p>

The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a fast-food restaurant involving a group of teenagers, which then spilled outside where gunshots were fired. The gunman's intended target, a 19-year-old man, was shot in the foot, while two innocent bystanders—an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man—were also wounded. All victims were hospitalized in stable condition, and the suspect faces charges including attempted murder.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom after the 2008 recession, is now facing a bust due to a combination of economic factors. Slowing consumer demand, Gen-Z's reduced alcohol consumption, and the looming threat of retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada have led to declining sales for major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey. The downturn has already caused bankruptcies and consolidation among smaller distilleries.

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to meet with Qatar's prime minister in Spain to advance a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal for ending the war in Gaza. The framework reportedly includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory. The meeting comes amid growing international condemnation of Israel's plan for a military takeover of Gaza City, which critics fear will worsen the humanitarian crisis. The U.N. Security Council has planned an emergency meeting to address the escalating situation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has strongly dismissed the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, asserting that any peace deal made without Kyiv's involvement would be a "dead solution." In a firm statement, Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not give up land to the occupier. His comments reflect deep anxiety in Ukraine and Europe that a direct meeting between the U.S. and Russian leaders could result in a deal that marginalizes Ukrainian interests, a fear compounded by Trump's suggestion of potential "swapping of territories."</p>

          <p>A man in Leicestershire, UK, was wrongly issued a £165 parking penalty after an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. Richard Lynn paid for 30 minutes of parking, but the system recorded his Hyundai entering and a different car, a Kia with a nearly identical license plate, leaving nine hours later. The private parking firm, Horizon Parking, issued the fine and sent threatening legal letters without manually checking the photographic evidence. The incident highlights potential flaws in automated enforcement systems and the aggressive tactics used by private parking companies.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, that he considers himself "culturally Irish" has ignited a broader conversation about identity in 2025. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection to the country where his musical tastes were formed. The article explores the complex, evolving nature of what it means to be Irish, touching on the experiences of the diaspora, the multifaceted identities in Northern Ireland, and the cross-fertilization of cultures between Ireland and Britain. It suggests identity is increasingly seen as a fluid, personal concept.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger is investigating the recent $4.3 million auction of a massive Martian meteorite that was discovered in the country's Sahara Desert region in 2023. Officials in Niger have expressed doubts about the legality of the meteorite's export, raising concerns about illicit trafficking of the nation's natural heritage. The 24.7kg rock, the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, was sold by Sotheby's to an anonymous buyer. While the auction house insists all international procedures were followed, the incident has highlighted the ambiguity in laws governing extraterrestrial objects and valuable artifacts.</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has received overwhelmingly negative reviews, sparking a discussion about why some audiences are drawn to "bad" movies. With a near-0% score on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has intrigued viewers who find entertainment in poorly executed or unintentionally funny productions. Experts and film fans suggest that earnestly made but flawed films can be more memorable and enjoyable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. This phenomenon has created cult followings for movies like "The Room" and "Samurai Cop," which are celebrated for being so bad they're good.</p>

          <p>Six months after its surprise launch, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 continues to have a lasting impact on the AI industry, despite fading from headlines. The app's initial success challenged the "bigger is better" philosophy of American AI development, demonstrating that powerful models could be built more efficiently. While security concerns about its Chinese origins persist, some cash-strapped US startups continue to use DeepSeek to cut costs. The app's arrival also intensified the US-China AI rivalry, framing the technology as a critical area for national security and economic dominance, a narrative that continues to drive investment.</p>

          <p>JT Lindsey, a freshman running back for Louisiana State University, has been arrested and suspended from the football team after allegedly harboring two murder suspects in his campus dorm room. The suspects, wanted in connection with a fatal shooting in May, were apprehended by U.S. Marshals in Lindsey's apartment-style dorm, where multiple firearms were also found. Lindsey's lawyer claims the player was unaware his friends were wanted for murder. However, an arrest warrant suggests it is "highly unlikely" he was unaware, citing an associate who told investigators Lindsey knew about the charges.</p>
