          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 335 individuals during a protest supporting Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the government. The demonstration in Trafalgar Square proceeded despite calls from police and politicians to postpone it, following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers, Defend Our Juries, stated the protest was also a vigil and that cancelling it would mean "letting terror win." The significant police presence, involving 1,500 officers, was required to manage the event, with many arrests involving protesters who had to be physically carried away.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk to sell GLP-1 weight-loss medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at a significantly reduced cost. The program allows members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket to purchase a four-week supply for $499, roughly half the typical price. This initiative aims to provide access to authentic versions of the high-demand drugs, countering the trend of consumers turning to cheaper, unregulated compounded alternatives. The move could substantially increase the accessibility of these medications for Americans.</p>

          <p>After two decades of meticulous restoration work led by a Japanese team, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Luxor, Egypt. The site, one of the largest in the Valley of the Kings, dates back over 3,000 years and had suffered severe deterioration before the extensive conservation project began. The tomb features a long, sloping passageway and chambers decorated with exquisite wall paintings from the Eighteenth Dynasty. Officials praised the restoration, which involved over 260 specialists, for adhering to the highest international standards.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is being analyzed as a situation that former President Donald Trump, while not having explicitly chosen it, may be leveraging for political gain. According to reporting in The Atlantic, Trump views the conflict as beneficial to him and the Republican party, embracing the fight with Democrats. Some in his circle also see the shutdown as an opportunity for the "deconstruction of the administrative state," a long-held conservative goal. However, there is an internal awareness that this strategy could lead to political blowback if it continues for an extended period.</p>

The Office of Rail and Road prosecuted GWR, finding that the company was aware of the risks associated with these windows but had failed to implement safety measures identified in a risk assessment.

He argued that without humans present to perform repairs and maintenance, the robots would quickly become non-functional husks.

          <p>A journal affiliated with the Chinese military has detailed the development of new unmanned underwater systems described as intelligent and "disruptive." According to the article, these systems are designed for stealth, operating below 90 decibels to evade enemy sonar detection. The technology can be integrated with various naval assets, including submarine-launched missiles and smart mines, to create a comprehensive, multi-layered strike network. The report indicates that the PLA Navy has already displayed several new unmanned submersibles and surface vessels, signaling a significant advancement in its autonomous naval capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Government Shutdown Leaves US National Parks in a State of Confusion and Risk</h2>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has thrown the national park system into a state of limbo, causing confusion for visitors and creating risks for the parks themselves. While some parks have closed entirely, others remain partially open with skeleton crews, leading to a lack of services like fee collection, maintenance, and visitor information. This situation has advocates concerned, recalling the 2018 shutdown when parks like Joshua Tree suffered damage from vandalism and neglect. The partial openings also pose safety risks due to reduced law enforcement, while gateway communities suffer significant economic losses.</p>

          <p>Small college towns across the United States are facing economic hardship due to a sharp decline in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by Trump administration policies. Universities, such as Miami University in Ohio, have seen their international student populations plummet, resulting in potential revenue losses of over $100 million. This decline is attributed to factors like stricter visa vetting processes and a climate of fear following campus protests. The economic impact is particularly severe in rural areas where universities are major employers and international students contribute significantly to the local economy.</p>

Ryan pays $850 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the city's tallest residential towers, a fraction of what comparable housing would cost in the U.S. He says the move has dramatically improved his mental health and motivation, allowing him to escape the "survival mode" he felt in America and focus on personal happiness and growth.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing severe financial distress for hourly contractors who, unlike some federal employees, are not guaranteed back pay. Willie Price, a 65-year-old who works two jobs, including one at the Library of Congress, says she lives paycheck to paycheck and fears losing her house and car if the shutdown persists. Labor unions are highlighting the immense strain on these low-wage workers, who are often forced to borrow money or ration food to survive. The situation underscores the precarious financial position of many federally contracted workers who are left without a safety net.</p>

          <p>A key issue fueling the government shutdown is the looming expiration of enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could cause insurance premiums to spike for 24 million Americans. Jon Godfread, North Dakota's Republican insurance commissioner, warns that Congress must act before the November 1 open enrollment period begins. He states that without the subsidies, a family's monthly premium could jump from $800 to $3,000. Insurance commissioners from both red and blue states are unanimously urging lawmakers to extend the tax credits to prevent this disruption to the healthcare market.</p>

          <p>Following his indictment for allegedly lying to Congress, the FBI is reportedly considering a "showy" arrest and perp walk for its former director, James Comey. According to sources, FBI leadership discussed using large agents in full tactical gear for the arrest, a plan that is highly unusual for a white-collar defendant. An FBI supervisory agent who refused to participate in the plan was reportedly suspended for insubordination, and other supervisors have also declined to cooperate. This development escalates the feud between Comey and former President Trump, who had publicly pressured the Attorney General to investigate him.</p>

The report identified 412 such cases across 16 states, most involving low-income women and allegations of substance use during pregnancy. This trend reflects a growing legal acceptance of "fetal personhood," where laws intended to protect children are being applied to fetuses.
