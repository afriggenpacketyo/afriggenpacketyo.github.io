          <p>Amazon has announced it will shut down its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August, consolidating its content into the Prime Video platform. Originally launched in 2019, the Freevee app will be discontinued, but its shows and movies will remain available to watch for free on Prime Video, even without a Prime membership. This decision follows Amazon's introduction of an ad-supported tier to its main Prime Video service earlier this year.

          <p>Tesla has reported a 14% year-over-year decline in vehicle deliveries for the second quarter, delivering approximately 384,000 vehicles and narrowly missing Wall Street expectations. This marks the second straight quarterly drop, attributed to intensifying competition, particularly from Chinese EV makers, and political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Despite the decline, the company's stock rose, with some analysts suggesting this quarter may represent the lowest point for Tesla's sales figures. The report also noted that the company produced over 410,000 vehicles during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

The event aimed to unify the party and energize voters ahead of the key election, focusing on themes of job growth and business-friendly policies.

          <p>The CEO of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson, has warned that the organization could lose approximately $700 million in federal funding if the Republican-led spending and tax bill passes. This loss would result from a provision imposing a one-year Medicaid ban on healthcare non-profits that provide abortions, potentially forcing nearly 200 health centers to close. McGill Johnson characterized the measure as a "backdoor abortion ban" that would gut the nation's healthcare safety net, primarily affecting clinics in states where abortion remains legal. The provision targets a significant portion of the nearly 1.1 million patients who rely on Planned Parenthood for a range of health services.</p>

Industry leaders and unions have praised the decision, stating it will help stimulate production that has slowed due to strikes, studio spending cuts, and other recent challenges.

          <p>While Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are an attractive borrowing option for homeowners with significant equity, they often come with numerous fees that can increase the total cost. This article outlines six common charges that borrowers should be aware of, including application fees, appraisal costs, and annual maintenance or inactivity fees. Additionally, borrowers may face closing costs similar to a mortgage, early termination penalties if the line is closed too soon, and transaction fees for accessing funds. Experts advise carefully reviewing the fine print and comparing offers from multiple lenders to minimize these expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

It also proposes extending Trump-era tax cuts, which are partially offset by new eligibility rules for Medicaid and food aid programs that could cause millions to lose coverage.

The decision follows an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and spray-painted aircraft.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to severely limit access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" to justify the crackdown, unlawfully supplants the immigration laws established by Congress. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor existing statutes grant the executive branch the sweeping authority to create an alternative immigration system. The ruling is a significant blow to one of President Trump's key second-term immigration policies, though its effective date is paused for 14 days to allow for an appeal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, well before the previously established February 2026 deadline. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which currently protects migrants who have built lives in the U.S. based on the program.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in federally approved grants for after-school programs, summer camps, and other educational services pending a review. The move has created uncertainty for schools and providers who rely on the funds, which were expected to be distributed on July 1. Democrats and education advocates argue the administration is illegally impounding appropriated money, which could force programs to shut down and jeopardize services for low-income families. The White House stated the review is to ensure the grants align with the president's priorities, while critics fear it is an attempt to eliminate the programs entirely.</p>

          <p>Amid a severe heat wave, the European Commission has proposed a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. This goal is intended to keep the bloc on track for its 2050 net-zero target and provide certainty for investors. However, the proposal includes a controversial flexibility clause allowing member states to purchase international carbon credits to offset up to 3% of their emissions from 2036.

          <p>This article provides a legal analysis of the verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial, where he was acquitted of racketeering but convicted on two prostitution-related counts. The most serious charge, racketeering conspiracy under the RICO Act, was challenging for prosecutors as it required proving a coordinated criminal enterprise, which the jury did not find. Combs was convicted of violating the Mann Act, a century-old law prohibiting the transport of individuals across state lines for prostitution, based on testimony about organized sexual encounters. While acquitted of charges that could have led to life in prison, Combs still faces up to 10 years for each conviction.</p>
