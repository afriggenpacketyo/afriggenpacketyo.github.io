          <p>Jon Worrell has been charged with the murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, who was fatally shot in 2006 at their family business in Georgia. The investigation had gone cold until investigators traveled to Costa Rica and secured the cooperation of the family's former live-in nanny. The nanny's information corroborated existing evidence, leading to Worrell's arrest in Missouri. Doris Worrell's sister remembered her as a kind and generous person, noting that her kindness in welcoming the nanny into their home ultimately contributed to her death; the Worrells had marital issues due to Jon's relationship with the nanny.</p>

          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in as Ecuador's President for a second term, vowing to combat corruption, drug trafficking, and violent crime. Noboa, who first became president in November 2023, pledged to implement reforms and foster job creation by collaborating with the private sector. Violence and high unemployment are significant challenges for his administration, which holds a narrow majority in Congress. Experts suggest Noboa will likely maintain his focus on using state power to combat crime, though some emphasize the need to address the root causes of violence by improving opportunities in jobs, healthcare, and education.</p>

          <p>A New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) worker died and two others were injured after a raw sewage boat exploded in the Hudson River. The explosion occurred on the city-owned vessel, Hunts Point, which transports raw sewage. One employee died after being "blown by a force explosion in between the pier and the vessel itself," while another was hospitalized. The cause of the explosion is under investigation, and responding FDNY personnel were decontaminated due to the raw sewage on the ship's deck.

Slegers, who took charge in October, was permanently appointed in January after an unbeaten run, steadying the ship and leading Arsenal to comeback victories against Real Madrid and Lyon.

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, originated in Israel with the goal of undermining Hamas and circumventing the United Nations. The plan involves foreign contractors, including a security group run by a former C.I.A. officer, distributing aid in areas under Israeli military control. Israeli officials believe this approach will prevent aid from falling into the wrong hands and bypass the UN, which they accuse of bias. However, the UN warns that the plan could restrict aid to limited areas and facilitate the displacement of civilians out of northern Gaza.</p>
