          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to curtail federal support for electric vehicles (EVs) are creating uncertainty in the EV charging industry.  The suspension of the NEVI program, which aimed to build a nationwide network of EV chargers, has stalled projects and caused range anxiety among consumers. This policy shift contrasts with the Biden administration's goal of widespread EV adoption and raises concerns about the future of EV infrastructure.</p>
