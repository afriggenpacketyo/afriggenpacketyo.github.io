          <p>A Palestinian American man has died from smoke inhalation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank following a confrontation where Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles. U.S. officials confirmed the death and are providing consular assistance, condemning the "criminal violence by any party." The incident is the latest in a series of violent events in the region, which has seen a surge in attacks since the October 7th Hamas assault on Israel. Israeli police have opened an investigation but have not yet made any arrests.</p>

          <p>The UN's migration agency reported that a boat carrying 154 Ethiopian migrants capsized off the coast of Yemen, resulting in at least 68 deaths with 74 others missing and presumed dead. Only 12 migrants survived the shipwreck in the Gulf of Aden. This tragedy highlights the perilous journey many migrants from East Africa and the Horn of Africa undertake to reach Gulf Arab countries for work, despite Yemen's ongoing civil war. Hundreds have died in similar incidents in recent months, underscoring the dangers of the smuggling routes.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over former President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey, property. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention and escorted the plane out of the restricted airspace. This was one of five such incursions over the weekend, prompting NORAD to remind general aviation pilots to check for flight restrictions before takeoff. Officials emphasized that the flares are used with the highest regard for safety and pose no danger to people on the ground.</p>

          <p>An Israeli official has stated that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a "military solution" to rescue the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This shift in strategy comes amid a perceived lack of progress in diplomatic negotiations and growing domestic pressure from protesters and hostage families. The report highlights the dire condition of the hostages, with Hamas releasing a video showing an emaciated captive. The situation unfolds as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with a rising death toll from malnutrition reported by the Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced that the tariff rates on imports from over 60 trading partners, established by a recent executive order from President Trump, are "pretty much set." The order imposes a baseline 10% tariff on all imports starting August 7, with some countries like Canada facing higher rates. Greer stated that while trade ministers are seeking further discussion, he does not expect the rates to be negotiated down, framing the tariffs as a tool to reduce the trade deficit. The article notes that economists are predicting the trade war will lead to slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of over 50 Democratic state lawmakers has left Texas for Illinois to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by President Trump, would significantly favor the GOP by creating five new Republican-leaning districts. The Democrats plan to stay away until the end of the special legislative session, despite facing potential fines and threats of arrest from Republican state officials. The article provides context, noting this is a recurring tactic in Texas politics and also points out that gerrymandering is a bipartisan practice in the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's plan to create a new, massive embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London is facing significant opposition due to security and espionage fears.

This technology is seen as a crucial step in developing "world models" that can help AI understand and learn about the physical world. Such simulated environments could be used to train robots for real-world tasks more efficiently and safely than physical training alone.</p>

          <p>Elective egg freezing is rapidly gaining popularity among women, offering them the ability to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood, a choice some see as revolutionary as the birth control pill. The procedure involves hormone injections and a surgical retrieval, with an average cost of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage and future IVF fees. While many women find it empowering, bioethicists caution that it is not a guarantee of a future baby, as there is a drop-off at each stage from thawing to birth. This article explores the personal stories, high costs, and societal implications of this growing trend.</p>

He also suggested that China should diversify its export markets away from the U.S. and Europe, focusing instead on growing economies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

          <p>A new series from NPR's "Embedded" podcast, titled "Tested," investigates the controversial history and ongoing debate surrounding sex and gender testing in competitive sports. The series examines how sports governing bodies have attempted to define and enforce rules based on biological sex, often leading to intrusive and contentious outcomes for athletes. It delves into the scientific and ethical complexities of these policies, questioning what constitutes "fair" competition in a world with evolving understandings of gender. The podcast explores the personal impact these regulations have had on athletes' lives and careers.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report that included downward revisions to previous months' data. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the dismissal, suggesting a new appointee would ensure more "transparent and reliable" data. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and Democratic lawmakers, who accuse the president of "shooting the messenger" and undermining the credibility of vital government statistics for political reasons. Former BLS officials warned the firing sets a dangerous precedent.</p>

The suspect's niece stated that her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years, while the daughter of one victim described him as having PTSD from his military service.</p>

          <p>In a recent court filing, Trump administration attorneys have denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements from White House officials. The filing is part of a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional immigration sweeps in Southern California. Previously, White House adviser Stephen Miller had publicly stated the administration was "looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests" per day. The government's lawyers now claim that while the figure may have been discussed as a goal, no such policy or directive was ever officially issued to immigration agencies.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven primarily by economic factors rather than climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the charge, taking advantage of rules that streamline the construction of solar farms, which are now often cheaper than natural gas. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop solar installations. Despite the growth, challenges remain, including the need for significant grid upgrades and the state's continued heavy reliance on natural gas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal crossings of the English Channel. The move aims to give law enforcement more tools to combat criminal gangs who promote their services online, often with false promises of a safe journey. The Home Office reports that a record number of migrants have made the dangerous journey this year, with a vast majority using social media to contact smugglers.
