President Trump had considered attending the meeting to help broker peace but ultimately decided to visit the United Arab Emirates instead, sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his place. Zelensky stated he is awaiting to see who Russia sends before deciding on Ukraine's next steps, urging strong Western sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting. The article notes the high stakes for both sides after over three years of war, with Russia claiming battlefield victories despite depleted forces and Ukraine seeking security guarantees from the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities, escalating a clash between the Trump administration and local officials over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction after allegedly misdirecting federal agents away from an individual in her court who was in the U.S. illegally. Dugan filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming judicial immunity, while prosecutors argue she escorted the individual and his lawyer out of the courtroom through a back door after learning of ICE agents' presence.

          <p>Customs and Border Protection officers in Southern California seized approximately 150,000 illegally imported cigarettes from two cruise ship passengers arriving from Ensenada, Mexico.

The city's decision to drop a bomb on the MOVE compound, a Black liberation group, resulted in a fire that killed 11 people, including five children, and destroyed dozens of homes. While the city has installed a historical marker, some, like Mike Africa, feel it doesn't adequately capture the trauma and grief. Others argue that the city has not fully addressed the systemic inequities that led to the confrontation, calling for greater inclusion of the event in school curricula.</p>

          <p>Frustration with demeaning portrayals of Chinese people in early Hollywood films led to the creation of the Great Wall Film Company in Brooklyn in the 1920s. Financed by Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do, the studio aimed to counter stereotypes and provide a more authentic representation of the Chinese community. The studio, located in Gravesend, produced films distributed in the U.S. and China, reflecting a "do-it-yourself" mentality within Chinese-American communities. Though short-lived due to the Great Depression, the Lee family's legacy continued with the New York Chinese Film Exchange, showcasing Chinese movies and fostering cultural connection.</p>

          <p>A hotline providing direct communication between the Pentagon and the air traffic control tower at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has been non-functional since March 2022, according to the FAA. The acknowledgment came during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, prompted by a deadly January collision between an Army helicopter and a commercial jet. The FAA stated it was unaware of the outage until after the accident and is now insisting on its repair before resuming operations from the Pentagon. The Army has halted training flights in the National Capital Region following the incident.</p>

Despite her admission of the infraction, the government intends to deport Petrova back to Russia, where she fears arrest due to her history of political protest. A federal judge questioned the authority to cancel Petrova's visa, leading to the unsealing of a criminal complaint.
