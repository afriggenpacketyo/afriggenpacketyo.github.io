          <p>Tees Valley Mayor Lord Houchen suggested that the Conservative Party might need to form a coalition with Reform UK to prevent a Labour government, highlighting the challenge Reform poses to the Tory vote. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has ruled out a coalition with Nigel Farage's party at a national level. Houchen emphasized the practicalities of keeping Labour out of power, while Badenoch acknowledged the possibility of local-level coalitions, noting the different dynamics of local elections. The political landscape is shifting, with Reform gaining traction and potentially impacting both Tory and Labour support as local elections approach. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Palestinian officials report that over 52,000 people have been killed in Gaza as Israel continues its offensive following the end of a ceasefire with Hamas, while aid groups warn of severe shortages of food and medicine. Israel has sealed off the territory, citing the need to pressure Hamas to release hostages abducted in the October 7, 2023, attack. Hamas insists on a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal in exchange for the remaining hostages, a condition that has stalled negotiations. The dire humanitarian situation worsens as supplies dwindle and malnutrition rises among the Gazan population. Optimism score: 10</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that while President Trump maintains strong support from his base, concerns are growing about his focus on tariffs and their impact on prices. While MAGA Republicans express optimism about the economy, others, including independents and young people, are becoming less approving of Trump's economic policies. Immigration policies, particularly deportation efforts, continue to receive majority approval, though concerns exist about potential errors in implementation. Democrats remain overwhelmingly critical, expressing frustration with their party's response and the president's perceived expansion of presidential powers. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with President Zelensky has sparked cautious optimism among Ukrainians, particularly after Trump questioned Putin's continued aggression during peace negotiations. Trump's remarks suggest he may not force Ukraine into a disadvantageous peace plan, which contrasts with previous US proposals that required Ukraine to abandon NATO aspirations and concede territory. This shift in tone offers a potential glimmer of hope for a more favorable resolution to the conflict. Optimism score: 50</p>
