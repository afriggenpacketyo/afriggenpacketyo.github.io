          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling that inflation pressures are beginning to subside. This decision comes after seasonally-adjusted inflation in April fell to 6.2%, a significant decrease from the first quarter's average of 8.2%. While domestic demand still exceeds supply capabilities, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path. The central bank plans to maintain a tight monetary policy for an extended period to achieve its 4% inflation target, especially as the invasion of Ukraine has put immense strain on prices. </p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed reversing its 2019 ban on offering crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, aiming to align with the U.S. and other financial hubs. Crypto ETNs are debt instruments linked to cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to gain exposure to digital tokens through regulated exchanges. The FCA's proposal intends to support U.K. growth and competitiveness, while restrictions on crypto derivatives will remain in place. This move has been praised by crypto firms as a significant advancement for the industry in the U.K., and the FCA is separately working on implementing a regulatory regime for crypto by 2026. </p>

          <p>The partnership between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has rapidly deteriorated, ending a nearly year-long alliance where Musk supported Trump's policies and served as a key advisor. The fallout was triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and immigration bill, leading to a public exchange of insults and accusations. Trump expressed disinterest in further communication with Musk, while Musk questioned Trump's electoral success without his support. The sudden split highlights the divergent interests and clashing egos of the two figures. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has downplayed his recent public feud with Elon Musk, referring to Musk as someone who has "lost his mind" and expressing a lack of interest in speaking with him. This follows Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and immigration bill, which led to a heated exchange between the two. Trump is reportedly more saddened than angered by the split, and is considering selling a Tesla he purchased to support Musk.

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital regulations for UBS following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023, potentially requiring UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital. These measures aim to safeguard the national economy and financial system, given UBS's balance sheet has doubled to $1.7 trillion, exceeding Switzerland's projected economic output. UBS argues that these stricter requirements will impact its competitiveness, while regulators emphasize the need for stronger capital buffers to cover potential losses at its foreign units. The proposed rules come amid concerns over UBS's ability to manage risks and maintain liquidity. </p>

          <p>Tesla stock is rebounding in pre-market trading following a sharp decline triggered by an online dispute between President Trump and CEO Elon Musk. Share prices were up 4.5% before the market opened, signaling a potential recovery after the stock experienced its steepest sell-off in almost five years. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives suggests the dispute unnerved Tesla investors, but remains optimistic about the stock's future. The spat between Musk and Trump led to a significant drop in Tesla's market value and a $34 billion plunge in Musk's net worth. </p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, surpassing expectations despite concerns about tariffs and a potential economic slowdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and worker pay grew more than anticipated, with average hourly earnings up 0.4% for the month and 3.9% year-over-year. Job growth was primarily driven by the health care and leisure and hospitality sectors, while government employment saw a decline due to efforts to reduce the federal workforce.
