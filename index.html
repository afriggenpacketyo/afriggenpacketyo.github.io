          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity stabbing in Cardiff, his sister has publicly appealed to the fugitive suspected of ordering the attack. Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, allegedly hired two hitmen who went to the wrong address, killing the ambitious A-level student in front of his parents. In a BBC podcast, Aamir's sister, Nishat, urged Ege to surrender, stating he is not truly free while living a life on the run. South Wales Police continue to offer a reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Wipha has made landfall in southern China, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents in Guangdong province. The China Meteorological Administration issued an orange alert, its second-highest warning level, as the storm brought powerful winds exceeding 150 km/h and torrential rain. Authorities evacuated over 12,000 people from sea-based locations and 266,000 from land areas at risk of extreme downpours and flooding. The powerful storm also impacted the neighboring provinces of Fujian and Hainan, as well as Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week places a spotlight on major European banks, with earnings reports expected from Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank. Market optimism is largely centered on the financial sector's resilience, even as other industries face downgrades. Concurrently, the European Central Bank is anticipated to hold interest rates steady, but investors are closely watching for potential policy shifts in response to possible U.S. tariffs on EU imports. Analysts suggest that a decision by the U.S. to impose tariffs could trigger a sharp market reaction and a subsequent rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Technology played a pivotal role in a Wisconsin murder investigation, both clearing an initial suspect and identifying the perpetrator. After Nicole Vander Heyden was found murdered in 2016, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was arrested but later exonerated when data from his Fitbit corroborated his alibi that he was home. The investigation then shifted after DNA from the crime scene identified George Steven Burch. Location data from Burch's Google Dashboard tracked his movements to the crime scene, the body disposal site, and other key locations, providing crucial evidence for his conviction.</p>

          <p>A recent congressional decision to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media is set to severely impact small, rural radio stations that provide essential local news and information. Allegheny Mountain Radio, a non-NPR cooperative serving communities in West Virginia and Virginia, relies on Corporation for Public Broadcasting grants for up to 65% of its budget. The station's general manager fears the cuts could eventually force staff reductions or station closures, threatening a vital information source in a region with spotty internet and cell service.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, commentator Simon Tisdall posits that the failure to resolve major global conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from a collapse of a shared "moral order." The article suggests that the routine nature of atrocities, such as the deliberate targeting of civilians, persists because universal ethical standards have been replaced by moral relativism. This fracturing of values makes peaceful settlement of disputes nearly impossible, leaving only coercion and manipulation. The author argues that this retreat into subjective morality, where social identity can trump conscience, undermines the collective response needed to end widespread suffering.</p>

          <p>Players in the WNBA All-Star Game wore warmup shirts with the message "Pay us what you owe us" to protest the lack of progress in collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations. The players and the league failed to reach an agreement after the players' union opted out of the previous CBA in October. They are seeking a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike expressed inspiration at the players' engagement, while others have raised the possibility of a walkout if a new deal is not reached.</p>

          <h2>Kabul Faces Catastrophic Water Shortage, Nearing Status of First Modern Capital to Run Dry</h2>

          <p>Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, is on the brink of a severe water crisis and could become the first modern capital city to run out of water. A combination of population growth, climate change, and over-extraction has dangerously depleted groundwater levels, with nearly half the city's boreholes already dry. Residents face a daily struggle, paying high prices for water and risking illness from contaminated sources. The situation is described as a humanitarian emergency, exacerbated by a freeze in foreign aid that has crippled infrastructure projects and deepened the cycle of poverty.</p>

          <h2>Two Charged with Murder in 2021 Stray-Bullet Killing of 13-Year-Old Pasadena Boy</h2>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet while playing video games in his Pasadena home, murder charges have been filed against two suspects. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has charged Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, as the suspected shooter and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, as the alleged getaway driver. A break in the cold case came after recently enhanced surveillance video and subsequent police sketches led to the suspects' identification and arrests. Authorities do not believe the boy was the intended target.</p>
