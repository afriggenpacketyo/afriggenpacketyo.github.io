          <p>A BBC undercover investigation has revealed dangerous illegal practices within the UK's booming aesthetics market, with nurses, pharmacists, and even a bogus doctor supplying Botox without proper checks. Researchers, posing as beauticians, documented prescribers issuing prescriptions via WhatsApp without in-person consultations and coaching clients to falsify records. These breaches of medical rules significantly elevate the risk of severe complications, including respiratory failure or death, as evidenced by a rise in reported incidents and 12 deaths since 2015. Regulators are reviewing the evidence, highlighting an urgent need for reforms in the industry to protect patient safety.</p>

          <p>Celebrated actress Nicole Kidman and country music star Keith Urban have reportedly separated after almost two decades of marriage, with sources indicating they have been living apart since the summer. The couple, who share two teenage daughters, married in 2006 and have frequently spoken about their strong bond, which endured challenges including Urban's addiction struggles early in their marriage. Despite their public appearances showing affection, the precise reasons for the split are undisclosed, though reports suggest Kidman had been striving to preserve the relationship. This marks a significant development for one of Hollywood's long-standing couples.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept it or face continued Israeli military action. The proposal includes an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for detained Gazans, and a future without Hamas governance. The plan also outlines an economic development initiative and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. International leaders, including the UK and French prime ministers, have welcomed the initiative as a potential path to peace.</p>

          <p>Global music sensation Bad Bunny has been announced as the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner, a decision that has ignited a "meltdown" among some conservative commentators. Critics are leveraging the Puerto Rican artist's predominantly Spanish-language music, past political endorsements, and immigration stances to fuel arguments that "woke culture" is permeating American institutions. Despite the backlash, the NFL's selection aligns with its strategy of featuring top-selling artists, as Bad Bunny is Spotify's most-streamed male artist. The article suggests these complaints are a recurring theme, often boosting the popularity of the targeted artists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading on Tuesday, with investor focus keenly set on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) upcoming interest rate decision. Analysts widely anticipate the RBA will maintain its cash rate at 3.6%, as persistent high inflation limits its capacity to ease monetary policy. Any deviation in the RBA's tone or forward guidance could significantly impact the Australian dollar, especially following recent volatility in building approvals data. Major regional indices, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi, reflected this cautious sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is projected to intensify into a hurricane by Tuesday morning, though its forecast path indicates it will move away from the southeastern U.S. and approach Bermuda. The storm, the ninth named system of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is currently bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the northwestern Bahamas. While a tropical storm watch for parts of Florida has been canceled, a hurricane watch is now in effect for Bermuda. Swells from Imelda and Hurricane Humberto are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland, authorized by the Secretary of Defense. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard for this purpose, emphasizing that local officials can manage public safety without federal intervention. The administration asserts the deployment is necessary to protect federal property and personnel from "violent riots." This legal challenge echoes a similar lawsuit filed by California earlier this year regarding federal troops in Los Angeles.</p>
