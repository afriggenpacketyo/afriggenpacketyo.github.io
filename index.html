          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a significant tariff increase that was set to take effect. The White House stated the extension allows more time for negotiations on trade imbalances and other economic issues, citing a nearly $300 billion trade deficit with China in 2024. Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. This pause comes amid ongoing discussions over technology access, rare earths, and the status of TikTok. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nepal is offering free climbing permits for 97 Himalayan mountains for the next two years in an effort to attract tourists to its more remote and less developed regions. This initiative contrasts with a recent fee increase for Mount Everest, which will now cost $15,000 to climb during peak season. The fee-waived peaks are located in the Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces, which are among the country's poorest. Officials hope the move will generate local jobs and economic growth, though questions remain about infrastructure readiness in these areas.</p>

His departure comes as GitHub faces intensified competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code. Dohmke, who will stay on until year-end to guide the transition, oversaw the launch of the popular AI coding assistant, Copilot. Following his exit, top GitHub executives will report to Microsoft's CoreAI division, highlighting the increasing integration of AI across Microsoft's platforms.</p>

She expresses regret over the handling of gender recognition legislation and discusses the case of an individual convicted of a double sexual assault who identified as a woman, admitting the situation made her seem weak. The book also details her strained relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond, the emotional weight of leading during the COVID-19 pandemic, and her own arrest during an investigation into SNP finances.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The move follows the president's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, questioning its methodology and data accuracy, and his nomination was publicly supported by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. The appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, has raised concerns among some economists about the politicization of the independent federal statistical agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl was attacked by a mountain lion while doing chores outside her family's home in Malibu on Sunday evening. Her mother and sibling rushed to help after hearing her screams, and their noise scared the animal away. The girl was hospitalized with injuries to her arm, leg, and back. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located and euthanized a mountain lion on the property, taking DNA samples to confirm it was the one responsible for the attack.</p>

Authorities recovered a loaded firearm from the first stolen truck and believe additional suspects may have been involved in the escape.</p>

Some businesses have resorted to locking their doors during operating hours, asking customers to knock to be let in, as a protective measure.

While Trump cited 2023 data to declare a crime emergency, recent figures show significant drops in violent crime, including murder and carjackings. The article frames the move as a "PR win" and a precedent for deploying armed forces in other cities, noting that supporters have praised the potential for an authoritarian-style crackdown.

          <p>This article scrutinizes the claims President Trump used to justify the federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force, arguing they are rooted in false and misleading narratives. It points out that while Trump cited 2023 crime rates, current data shows a significant drop in violent crime, with D.C. reaching a 30-year low in 2024. The analysis draws parallels to Trump's previous actions in Los Angeles, suggesting a pattern of portraying Democrat-led cities as lawless to justify federal intervention. The piece also notes that other cities targeted by Trump, like Baltimore and Chicago, have also seen recent crime declines.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned it is at risk of collapse after the Technology Secretary threatened to withdraw public funding. In a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission, staff raised alarms about a "toxic internal culture," misuse of public funds, and a failure to deliver on its mission. The government has urged the institute to pivot its focus to defense and national security research and has called for an overhaul of its leadership. This comes after months of internal turmoil, including job cuts and scrapped research projects.</p>

          <p>The three-year-old mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved after the killer's new girlfriend led police to his shallow grave. Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he and his brother had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later contacted the police. Parsons' family expressed immense gratitude for her quick thinking, which was crucial in recovering the body and bringing the case to a close.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will hold a bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, excluding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the talks. Trump is framing the meeting as a low-stakes "feel out" session to explore a potential deal to end the war, which he suggests will involve "land swapping." This analysis notes that Trump's simultaneous law-and-order crackdown in Washington D.C. appears timed to project an image of bold leadership ahead of the summit. The exclusion of Ukraine's president suggests the talks are more of a power play between the two leaders than a comprehensive peace negotiation.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and members of his cabinet, calling him a "success" just days after demanding his immediate resignation. The president's initial call for Tan to step down followed questions from a Republican senator about the CEO's ties to China. This reversal comes as the Trump administration takes a more interventionist role in the semiconductor industry, recently striking a deal with Nvidia for a 15% revenue cut on its China sales. The meeting suggests a shift in the administration's approach to Intel's leadership amid the ongoing tech competition with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains President Trump's decision to federalize the Washington, D.C. police and deploy the National Guard, an action technically within his presidential authority but based on disputed premises. The move, which can last up to 30 days without congressional action, was justified by Trump as a response to rampant crime, though data shows violent crime in D.C. has fallen to a 30-year low. The action raises concerns due to the president's past use of law enforcement during protests and his rhetoric about allowing police to act without restraint, creating uncertainty about the implications for the city.</p>
