          <p>The Princess of Wales spoke candidly about the profound, life-changing challenges of recovering after chemotherapy during a visit to a hospital in Essex. She explained that while individuals maintain a brave face during treatment, the post-treatment phase can feel exceptionally difficult, as normal functioning at home is often not immediately possible. Catherine emphasized that this is a life-changing experience for both patients and their families, often unrecognized, and highlighted how the natural world has served as her personal sanctuary during her own recovery journey. She also participated in planting "Catherine's roses" at the hospital's well-being garden, symbolizing healing and support for cancer patients.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 14% year-over-year decline in second-quarter vehicle deliveries, totaling just over 384,000 units, marking its second consecutive quarterly drop. Despite this significant decrease, the company's shares surprisingly rose 5%, with some analysts suggesting this period might represent the bottom for Tesla's delivery performance. The electric vehicle giant continues to face intense competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers offering newer and more affordable models. Additionally, CEO Elon Musk's ongoing political controversies and their potential impact on Tesla's reputation and sales are noted in the article. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowner's insurance premiums are projected to surge across all 50 U.S. states this year, with an average increase of around 8%, significantly impacting housing costs nationwide. States like California and Louisiana are experiencing double-digit hikes due to severe natural disasters, including wildfires and floods, alongside rising property values and reconstruction expenses. Insurers are balancing their national risk exposure, leading to ripple effects that prompt aggressive premium increases and policy non-renewals in various regions. This trend suggests that home insurance is becoming an increasingly substantial and less predictable component of monthly housing payments. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision by the FBI and the U.S. General Services Administration marks a significant shift from the problematic J. Edgar Hoover building, which has faced structural issues for years. The move, however, has drawn criticism from Democratic members of Congress from Maryland, who had advocated for a consolidated campus in their state. FBI Director Kash Patel also plans to relocate approximately 10% of the Bureau's D.C. workforce nationwide.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged with the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is expected to plead guilty in a deal that would spare him the death penalty.

Concurrently, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen, with hundreds of civilians reportedly killed while attempting to access aid from the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

This marks the first monthly decline in private payrolls since March 2023, signaling a potential softening in the economy. The bulk of job losses occurred in professional and business services, and health and education sectors. While the ADP report's accuracy in predicting subsequent government jobs data can vary, this figure suggests a hesitation to hire and replace departing workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Modelo, reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that missed analysts' expectations, primarily due to the impact of aluminum tariffs. The company's profitability was notably affected by increased trade duties imposed by President Donald Trump on canned beer imports and aluminum. Additionally, Constellation is experiencing softer consumer demand, partly attributed to concerns among Hispanic consumers regarding Trump's immigration policies, as roughly half of its beer sales come from this demographic. Despite the weaker performance, the brewer reiterated its fiscal 2026 forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

The mayors contend that the rules unlawfully create barriers to affordable coverage, thereby increasing the uninsured population and burdening city services.

          <p>U.S. media conglomerate Paramount has agreed to a $16 million payout to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump, who alleged a misleading interview with Kamala Harris on CBS News' "60 Minutes." Trump's legal team claimed "mental anguish" over the interview's editing, although CBS maintained its journalistic integrity. The settlement, which notably does not include an apology, will be directed to Trump's future presidential library. This case, viewed by press freedom advocates as a challenge to free speech, follows a similar $15 million settlement by ABC News with the former president.</p>

          <h2>MS-13 Leader to Be Sentenced in Racketeering Case Involving Eight Murders</h2>

          <p>Alexi Saenz, a leader of an MS-13 clique, is scheduled for sentencing in a federal racketeering case involving eight murders, including the brutal 2016 killings of two high school girls. Saenz pleaded guilty last July, accepting a deal that removes the death penalty but could result in a maximum 70-year prison sentence, which prosecutors are seeking. His lawyers argue for leniency, citing his remorse and difficult upbringing, but prosecutors emphasize his continued gang affiliation while incarcerated. The sentencing aims to deliver justice for the victims of his "senseless" and "sadistic" crimes.</p>
