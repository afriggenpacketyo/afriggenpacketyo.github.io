          <p>The United States State Department has reportedly advised allied nations to avoid utilizing Chinese satellite services. A leaked internal memo suggests that these services could potentially be exploited by Beijing to gather military information and sensitive intelligence. The memo urges countries to exclude Chinese satellite providers from their markets to safeguard national security, business secrets, and citizens' privacy. Officials are cautioned to warn that engaging with Chinese space providers could advance Beijing's foreign policy objectives and risk transferring sensitive data to the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>Rising housing costs worldwide are being compounded by climate change-driven disasters, intensifying the global housing crisis. Extreme weather events and rising sea levels are altering the appeal of neighborhoods, leading to 'climate gentrification' where higher-income individuals displace lower-income residents in safer areas. Post-disaster housing becomes more expensive, with insurance costs skyrocketing in vulnerable regions. Addressing this requires expanding housing supply, transforming existing housing to reduce carbon footprint and climate vulnerability, and city planning that prioritizes low-risk areas.</p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a downturn after President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates, calling him a "major loser." Trump's remarks intensified market turmoil, already fueled by tariff plans and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell significantly, while the dollar index reached its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices, considered a safe-haven asset, reached a record high. Trump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term, and his recent comments have heightened concerns about the Fed's independence.</p>

This advancement appears to surpass the fast-charging technology of BYD, a Chinese EV giant, potentially alleviating consumer concerns regarding electric vehicle range and convenience.

This follows President Trump's imposition of a 145% tariff on most Chinese-made goods and the cancellation of a measure exempting items under $800 from taxes, impacting their business models.

While acknowledging the convenience of technology, the author argues that it has replaced human contact in ways that have left society poorer and more miserable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the United States are having a noticeable impact, with exports of these minerals plummeting and shipments of several items halting entirely in March. This move is a retaliation for Washington's tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially putting pressure on US manufacturers reliant on rare earths from China. China holds a dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, essential for various products from smartphones to military equipment. US-bound exports of tellurium, tungsten rod, and other tungsten products have declined significantly, while shipments of molybdenum powder and bismuth products have stopped completely.</p>

          <p>The design team behind China's J-36 stealth fighter is developing a computer system to aid pilots in landing the sixth-generation jet on aircraft carriers. The tri-engine, tailless flying-wing aircraft has drawn attention for its stealth capabilities and potential for long-range strikes. A research paper indicates that the naval variant of the J-36 is in early stages of development for use with the PLA Navy's growing fleet of aircraft carriers, addressing the high risks associated with landing such advanced aircraft on a moving carrier.</p>
