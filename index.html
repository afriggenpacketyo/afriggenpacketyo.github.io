His administration oversaw the legalization of abortion, gay marriage, and marijuana, earning him global recognition as a progressive leader. Mujica, a former guerrilla fighter, championed rural communities and was a vocal critic of unchecked consumerism, leaving a legacy of humility and social reform in Latin America.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book titled “Original Sin” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, promises to reveal new details about former President Biden's mental and physical decline while in the White House. The book chronicles how Biden's aides allegedly suppressed discussions of his age-related limitations, including internal concerns and external worries. The book details instances of Biden forgetting names of longtime aides and allies, and appearing frail in meetings. While the book lacks explosive revelations, it paints a picture of an aging president enabled by his inner circle.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office estimates that President Trump’s tariff policies will reduce state revenues by $16 billion through next year. Despite personal income tax and corporate tax receipts exceeding projections through April, the Newsom administration predicts overall revenues will be lower due to the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs. Newsom's team dubbed the anticipated shortfall the “Trump Slump,” as he prepares to present his revised 2025-26 state budget plan. California has also filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump lacks the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its contradictory refugee policies, as it welcomes white South Africans while simultaneously ending deportation protections for Afghans who assisted U.S. forces. The administration claims that the white Afrikaners, an ethnic minority in South Africa, have been “carefully vetted” and can be easily assimilated, while arguing that Afghans do not face a “serious threat to their personal safety” despite ongoing security risks. Experts have questioned this reasoning, noting that security threats remain in Afghanistan and that Afghans who cooperated with U.S. forces are at high risk.</p>
