          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to aid in its defense against Russia, just days after temporarily halting some shipments. President Trump stated the support is necessary because Ukraine is being hit hard and many people are dying. The decision comes after the White House confirmed a pause in shipments to review military stockpiles, a move the president claimed to be unaware of. The renewed support was discussed in recent calls between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who described the conversation as fruitful for strengthening Ukraine's air defense.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he is nominating US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in forging peace in the Middle East. The announcement was made during a dinner in Washington where the two leaders celebrated recent US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. They also discussed a 60-day ceasefire proposal for the conflict in Gaza and the potential for renewed talks with Iran. Trump expressed optimism that regional tensions would settle, while Netanyahu praised the president for his decisive actions, which he believes will lead to greater stability.</p>

Netanyahu's discussions with administration officials also touched upon a potential ceasefire with Hamas, with President Trump expressing optimism about an imminent agreement. The meetings underscore the ongoing diplomatic efforts and strategic coordination between the US and Israel on critical Middle East security issues.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked tennis player Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the Wimbledon semifinals after a difficult three-set victory over German veteran Laura Siegemund. Sabalenka, the clear title favorite, struggled against Siegemund's unconventional style, losing the first set before fighting back to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. The match, which lasted nearly three hours, tested Sabalenka's composure and grit as she overcame frustration to secure her spot.

          <p>A detailed investigation into the 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in Franklin County, Florida, revealed her involvement in a volatile three-person relationship, or 'throuple.' Seiden was found beaten to death after a road trip with her boyfriend, Zachary Abell, and his other partner, Christina Araujo. The case, featured on "48 Hours," traced the trio's journey, which ended at a motel where Seiden was killed. Evidence, including a palm print and testimony from Araujo, led to the conviction of Abell for second-degree murder, while Araujo received a lesser sentence after a plea deal, leaving many questions about the final, violent moments unanswered.</p>

The court found reasonable grounds to believe they have committed crimes against humanity through the systematic persecution of women and girls in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover. The Taliban has imposed severe restrictions, barring girls from education beyond age 12 and excluding women from most jobs. While the Taliban rejected the warrants, human rights groups have praised the move as a crucial step toward justice for Afghan women and victims of other abuses in the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed spending package, which includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, is expected to impact pharmaceutical companies, though some may be more exposed than others. According to an analysis by Leerink Partners, companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead, which rely more heavily on Medicaid for their U.S. revenue, could face greater negative effects. The cuts are projected to begin in 2027, giving the industry time to adjust. While Medicaid reimburses at lower rates than private insurance, the loss of this market segment represents a notable future challenge for drugmakers focused on treatments for conditions prevalent among Medicaid recipients.

          <p>A recent survey indicates that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their financial habits based on feelings of economic anxiety. This has led to a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to a new trend of "revenge saving," as people build emergency funds in response to concerns about inflation and a potential recession. Financial experts advise that while saving is positive, it should be intentional rather than purely emotional. They recommend strategies like reverse budgeting, where savings goals are prioritized first, and automating contributions to create a stable financial future.</p>

The piece argues that while conspiracy theories should be avoided, the fact that many powerful people associated with Epstein have faced no consequences points to a two-tiered justice system.

Economists counter that price hikes may still be forthcoming, attributing the current stability to implementation delays and corporate stockpiling, and they largely expect to see price increases in the coming months.

          <p>A major wildfire, sparked by a car fire on a motorway, has spread rapidly to the outskirts of Marseille, France's second-largest city. The city's mayor described the situation as "apocalyptic," with firefighters waging a difficult battle against the blaze, which has been intensified by strong winds and has already burned about 700 hectares. Marseille's airport has been closed, and residents in the path of the fire have been urged to stay indoors or evacuate, leading to significant traffic jams. The event underscores the heightened risk of wildfires in the region, which has experienced a prolonged period without rain.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive immigration sweeps by the Trump administration in Southern California have resulted in a growing issue of abandoned property, as detained individuals are forced to leave behind vehicles, work tools, and vending carts. In response, community advocacy groups and at least one local police department are making efforts to return these belongings to the families of those arrested by ICE. The Santa Ana Police Department has announced it will try to contact relatives to retrieve property before it is towed or lost. This initiative aims to alleviate an additional burden on families already facing separation and deportation.</p>

          <p>The first report from the official inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has concluded that the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters had a "disastrous" human impact. The report, led by Sir Wyn Williams, detailed severe consequences, including financial ruin, serious mental health issues, and multiple suicides linked to the ordeal. It criticizes the unjustifiable delays in compensation and calls for urgent reforms, including free legal advice for claimants and a restorative justice program. The government is expected to respond to the findings, which highlight a profound failure by the Post Office to address known software defects.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reportedly fired "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace following an inquiry into misconduct, as an additional 50 people have come forward with new claims. The allegations include inappropriate sexual comments and behavior, with one woman alleging he groped her and another claiming he exposed himself. In a statement, Wallace apologized for inappropriate humor and language but denied the most serious allegations, accusing BBC News of reporting "uncorroborated tittle tattle."

          <p>The UK's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), projects that the annual cost of the state pension triple lock will be three times higher than originally estimated, reaching £15.5 billion by 2030. The policy, which guarantees the state pension rises by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%, has become significantly more expensive due to recent volatility. The OBR's report also warned that the UK's public finances are in a "vulnerable position," with rising government debt exacerbated by recent reversals of planned spending cuts, putting long-term fiscal sustainability at risk.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Canada's decision to back down from its digital services tax after threats of retaliatory tariffs from the Trump administration demonstrates a troubling use of brute force in international policy. The author contends that digital taxes are a fair and efficient way for countries to ensure tech giants pay their share, and that the US opposition is driven by the interests of tech oligarchs. The article frames Canada's submission as a blow to the rule of law and national sovereignty, warning that it sets a dangerous precedent where US demands override negotiated international agreements.</p>

In the poll, the U.S. was more frequently named as the most important ally compared to China, but it was also more often cited as the greatest threat. In eight nations, including Canada and Indonesia, the U.S. was the most commonly mentioned threat. In contrast, only three countries—the U.S. itself, Australia, and Japan—viewed China as the top threat. The findings highlight America's dual role on the world stage, seen by some nations simultaneously as their primary partner and biggest danger.</p>

The Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise in the pre-dawn hours. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, with some defending their actions by citing the unprecedented nature of the "100-year flood" event.</p>

The bill also seeks to make voluntary service more attractive with significantly higher pay.
