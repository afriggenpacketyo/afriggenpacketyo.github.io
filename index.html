          <p>The author argues that the aesthetic of Trumpism is reflected in the sprawling, homogenous suburban landscapes of the United States, characterized by chain stores and a lack of individuality.  This sprawl is presented as visually unappealing and contributing to a sense of atomization and disconnection. The author connects this aesthetic to a lack of beauty, truth, and authentic experience.</p>
