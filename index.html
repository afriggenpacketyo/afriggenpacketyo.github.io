          <p>This Fox News article examines White House visitor logs to suggest that several top Democratic leaders were aware of former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. The article points out that frequent White House visitors, including Hakeem Jeffries and Katherine Clark, continued to publicly support Biden's leadership despite his apparent struggles. This comes amid the release of a book and leaked audio that detail Biden's memory lapses, fueling claims of a cover-up. The article suggests that these Democratic leaders participated in a "cover-up" by continuing to support Biden despite allegedly being aware of his condition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is experiencing fluctuations due to the ebb and flow of tariff changes, particularly between the U.S. and China. Executive Director Gene Seroka noted that a recent surge in container units was largely due to importers rushing cargo in before tariffs took effect. While April saw a significant increase in container movement, this boost is attributed to a "shipping panic" driven by uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies. This article highlights the immediate economic effects of trade tensions on major ports and import activities.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, reflecting concerns about growing government debt. This increase marks the first time since April 11 that the average 30-year mortgage rate has surpassed this threshold. Despite previous Federal Reserve rate cuts, mortgage rates have remained high due to their connection with the 10-year Treasury bond. The article suggests that while the market impact of Moody's downgrade may be limited, elevated mortgage rates will likely persist, impacting aspiring homebuyers who also face a shortage of affordable properties.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the complex reaction to former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s announcement that he has aggressive prostate cancer. While the diagnosis prompted an outpouring of well wishes, it also stirred some whispered uncertainties and a lack of trust in what he says about his health. The diagnosis has derailed Democrats’ nascent effort to acknowledge where they went wrong on his presidency and 2024 candidacy. Some Democrats, like Dean Phillips, suggested that the timing of the announcement was intended to deflect growing criticism.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's actions to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling came after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, took over USIP's headquarters, terminated staff, and replaced board members following an executive order deeming the group "unnecessary." Judge Beryl Howell ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president and stated that the administration's actions violated Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members. The USIP hailed the ruling, stating it would allow them to continue their work promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second-term tax bill is facing scrutiny as experts and agencies question its fiscal impact. The House Budget Committee initially failed to advance the bill due to concerns about its reliance on future spending cuts that are unlikely to materialize. Moody's downgraded the nation's credit rating, citing increased federal spending without corresponding tax increases. Despite Republican leaders' claims that the bill will improve the fiscal situation, critics argue that it relies on overly optimistic projections of economic growth and fails to address structural contradictions, such as extending tax cuts without offsetting spending cuts.</p>

López has been an outspoken critic of Bukele's authoritarian tactics and the government's crackdown on gangs, which has led to the imprisonment of about 85,000 people.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump joined President Trump in signing into law the Take It Down Act, which criminalizes posting "intimate images" online without consent and requires tech companies to remove the content within 48 hours. The First Lady has championed the bill since her husband began his second term, arguing that children need to be protected from hurtful online behavior. While the bill has received bipartisan support, some digital rights groups say it's too broad and could lead to censorship. The law makes posting "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content illegal, with violators facing up to three years in prison.</p>

          <p>House Republicans plan to vote on legislation containing President Trump's second term agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense priorities, but fractures within the GOP conference persist. President Trump is expected to personally visit House Republicans to urge them to back the bill. Disagreements remain on issues such as the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. The legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate, where some Republicans have warned they will seek changes.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that markets and central bankers are underestimating the risks posed by record U.S. deficits, tariffs, and international tensions.

Dimon anticipates Wall Street earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies will decline further due to the uncertainty caused by President Trump's trade policies.

          <p>Experts warn that the GOP tax and spending bill moving forward in the House could add trillions to the U.S. deficit. Projections indicate that the proposed tax breaks would significantly outstrip any savings, potentially leading to higher debt levels.
