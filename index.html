          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza, but it remains unclear whether the group has accepted or rejected the deal, which aims to halt fighting for at least two months and secure the release of some remaining hostages. While Hamas released a statement saying it sent mediators its response to the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, there appear to be other details that need to be worked out before a ceasefire is declared. The militant group is reportedly seeking a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war. More than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the war began nearly 20 months ago when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing about 1,200. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating insecurity among employees, especially Gen Zers who rely on instant answers. Studies show that the use of jargon often correlates with feelings of lower status within a company, especially when employees feel they are being 'layered' or undermined by superiors. The article suggests that buzzwords are a distraction from the primary goal of making money and encourages clear, human language in the workplace. Rather than relying on jargon, the author advocates for using real, understandable language in professional settings.</p>

          <p>Parisian authorities have launched an investigation into the vandalism of several Jewish sites, including the Shoah Memorial and three synagogues, which were defaced with green paint. The acts, discovered early Saturday morning, prompted expressions of "immense disgust" from Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, who highlighted the targeting of the Jewish community. The vandalism occurred ahead of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, leading the interior ministry to call for heightened security around Jewish sites due to increased global tensions. No suspects have been arrested, and no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, which come amid heightened global tensions.</p>

          <p>More than 130 former state and federal judges have filed an amicus brief, condemning the indictment of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan as an "egregious overreach" by the executive branch. Dugan was indicted in April for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest, a charge the former judges argue undermines judicial independence. They assert that judges are entitled to absolute immunity for their official acts and that any alleged mistakes should be addressed within the judicial branch, not through criminal prosecution. The group warns that the indictment sets a dangerous precedent that could chill judicial decision-making at every level.</p>

This decision has drawn criticism from leading pediatricians and obstetricians, who argue there is no new evidence to support the change.

Critics have accused her of devaluing motherhood and the significance of creating life, while supporters argue that she was highlighting the broader health implications of women's reproductive systems.

          <p>The AfD in Germany and similar radical right-wing groups portray themselves as defenders of Christian values against Islam, but their relationship with Christianity is more of a strategic alliance. While not particularly religious themselves, AfD leaders exploit traditional Christian culture and values to stoke fears about Islam and social change. Critics argue that the AfD's use of Christianity is instrumental, drawing on traditions when it suits their agenda but not cultivating close ties with churches. The article suggests that this alliance is driven more by political opportunism than genuine religious conviction.</p>

          <p>The popular Mexican band Grupo Firme canceled a performance in California after the Trump administration suspended their visas, citing administrative review. This action follows a series of moves targeting Mexican artists who glorify cartel violence, a genre known as "narco-corridos." The U.S. State Department has been revoking visas for musicians playing this type of music, arguing that it promotes criminal activity. While Grupo Firme has distanced itself from glorifying criminal groups, the visa suspension highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding the genre and its impact on both sides of the border.</p>

Investigators are exploring whether the letter was a deliberate attempt to have Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying against his alleged attacker in court. The accusation, publicized by the Department of Homeland Security secretary, led to Morales-Reyes's arrest and detention by Ice officials. Local investigators found that the handwriting in the threatening letter did not match Morales-Reyes's handwriting, raising questions about the validity of the accusation.</p>
