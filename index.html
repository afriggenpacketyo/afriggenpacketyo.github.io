          <p>A new North Korean naval destroyer launch ended in failure, according to state media reports. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un witnessed the failed launch and described it as a "criminal act caused by absolute carelessness," which tarnished the country's dignity. According to reports, some sections of the warship's bottom were crushed during the failed launch. Kim has ordered the ship to be repaired ahead of a major meeting of the ruling Workers' Party Central Committee in late June, viewing the restoration as a political issue directly related to the authority of the state.</p>

          <p>During a meeting meant to improve relations between the US and South Africa, President Donald Trump surprised President Cyril Ramaphosa with claims that white farmers in South Africa were being killed and "persecuted". Trump played a video showing a protest exhibit of crosses, falsely claiming they were burial sites for murdered white farmers, while Ramaphosa stressed that improving trade relations with the US was his priority. Ramaphosa responded by stating that the film's opposition chants were not government policy and that South Africa remained committed to racial reconciliation. Ramaphosa also acknowledged that there was criminality in the country and that black people are the majority of victims.</p>

          <p>The Army is implementing a two-phase plan to separate service members experiencing gender dysphoria, following President Donald Trump's directive to prioritize military excellence and readiness. The first phase allows service members diagnosed with or having a history of gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate from the military branch, with a deadline of June 6. After the deadline, the Army will enter the involuntary separation phase, identifying service members' records reflecting their sex at birth. The Army spokesperson said that regardless of potential outcome, every service member will be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials are prepared to sue if Congress revokes the waivers, which are expected to impact cities and states nationwide that have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>Temperatures in the seas around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas up to 4C warmer than normal, potentially affecting marine life and swimmers. The heatwave is most intense off the west coast of Ireland and parts of Cornwall and Devon. Scientists attribute the surge to climate change and one of the warmest Springs on record, with high temperatures and weak winds warming the ocean's top layer. While the worst impacts on species may be avoided for now, the heatwave could disrupt breeding patterns and lead to an influx of jellyfish and harmful algae.</p>

          <p>Amid claims of a "white genocide" in South Africa, some Afrikaners are pushing back against the narrative, stating it is not happening. While the Trump administration has welcomed Afrikaner asylum applicants, granting them expedited refugee status, others within the Afrikaner community dispute the claims of widespread violence and discrimination. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp says the claims are untrue, noting that Whites are economically the strongest group in South Africa. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein agrees, saying that he feels safe and that most farmers understand that the land must be shared by both Black and White.</p>

          <p>Food banks in Florida are struggling to meet the needs of the communities they serve due to recent funding cuts. The White House's Department of Government Efficiency cut funding for about $1 billion worth of U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, which allowed schools and food banks to purchase food directly from local farmers and producers. For Feeding South Florida, the cuts amount to 40% of its $37 million annual budget, leading to empty racks and increased desperation among families. Farmers are also affected, as they no longer have the funds to process surplus produce destined for families in need.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with key conservative holdouts to the massive budget package containing his second-term agenda, as GOP leaders aim to vote on the bill, possibly within hours. Speaker Mike Johnson called the meeting "productive," though details of the final version of the legislation have yet to be unveiled. Trump pressured members to fall in line, suggesting that any GOP member who doesn't back the "big, beautiful bill" would be "knocked out so fast." The bill faces opposition from both fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans.</p>

          <p>A New York police inspector, Terrell Anderson, has been transferred after allowing dozens of prospective officers to continue in the hiring process despite failing to meet mental health standards. Anderson, who commanded the candidate assessment division, reportedly overrode negative psychological reports for 80 candidates, allowing them to enter the Police Academy. The inspector's decisions came as the department is facing a shortage of officers. The police said that Inspector Anderson had been transferred and that the matter was under investigation.</p>

The Commercial Driver's License Workforce Development Program, a partnership between New York City's Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice and Emerge Career, trains formerly incarcerated people for trucking jobs. The program helps them get a commercial driver's license and connects them with trucking companies. In the 2024 fiscal year, 94% of participants in the training program graduated, and all of those graduates received job offers with an average starting salary of $75,000 per year.</p>

          <p>Jim Irsay, the Indianapolis Coltsâ€™ owner who leveraged the popularity of Peyton Manning into a new stadium and a Super Bowl title, died Wednesday at age 65. Irsay helped turn the Colts from a laughingstock into a perennial title contender, but had battled health problems in recent years and became less visible following a fall at his home. Irsay began his football life as a ball boy after his late father, Robert, acquired the team and also collected guitars, befriended musicians and often found inspiration in rock â€™nâ€™ roll lyrics.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers have advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, putting the proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk. The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions, but would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. Democrats have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has announced that it is starting the process of dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, bringing an end to investigations launched during former President Joe Biden's administration. The Trump administration said the consent decrees proposed by the Biden administration sought to subject the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments to sweeping terms that went beyond accusations of unconstitutional conduct and would have led to "years of micromanagement" of local departments. The federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department just days before the fifth anniversary of George Floydâ€™s killing. Officials and residents expressed dismay about the administrationâ€™s decision, saying that oversight had been aimed at ending what federal authorities had described as a longstanding pattern of violent, racist and unconstitutional practices by the cityâ€™s Police Department. The timing of the announcement, during a week when Mr. Floydâ€™s death is being observed with panel discussions, concerts, vigils and other gatherings in Minneapolis, struck many in the city as insensitive.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, granting sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while leasing back a crucial military base for 99 years. The deal previously appeared to have stalled after a change in government in both Mauritius and the US, but has now been revived. Under the terms of the deal Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a strategically important military base on one of the islands for an initial period of 99 years in exchange for a multi-billion pound payment. Representatives of the Chagossian community have been invited to meet with Stephen Doughty, the minister for Europe, North America and overseas territories, for discussions on the sovereignty of the territory.</p>
