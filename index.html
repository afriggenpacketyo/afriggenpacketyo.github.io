          <p>A significant wildfire near the Grand Canyon has destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, and caused a chlorine gas leak at a water treatment facility. The Dragon Bravo Fire has expanded rapidly due to high winds, forcing evacuations and complicating firefighting efforts. Meanwhile, the larger White Sage Fire has scorched over 40,000 acres, also prompting evacuations. These events are compounded by smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketing the U.S. Midwest, leading to widespread air quality alerts and health warnings across several states.</p>

          <p>A serious incident involving a plane crash has occurred at London Southend Airport, leading to the cancellation of multiple flights. Essex Police responded to reports of a 12-meter aircraft on fire shortly before 4:00 PM BST on Sunday. An eyewitness, who was watching planes with his family, described seeing the aircraft bank unusually after takeoff before it inverted and hit the ground, resulting in a large fireball. Emergency services are on the scene, and the public has been advised to avoid the area while the investigation and response efforts are underway.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has initiated a commission of inquiry to investigate allegations of criminal infiltration within the national police service. The move follows public accusations by a provincial police commissioner that Police Minister Senzo Mchunu interfered in investigations and has ties to criminal syndicates. In response to the growing scandal, Ramaphosa has placed Mchunu on a leave of absence and appointed an acting minister. The commission is tasked with a broad investigation into the justice system and is expected to deliver its first report within three months.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced on Sunday that it had located and killed two suspected Russian agents responsible for the assassination of a senior Ukrainian officer in Kyiv. The SBU stated the suspects were killed after resisting arrest, releasing a video showing two bodies on the ground. The targeted officer, Colonel Ivan Voronych, was fatally shot in a daylight attack on Thursday, an event captured by surveillance cameras. This incident occurs amid the ongoing war, where Russia has continued its drone attacks across Ukraine, resulting in further civilian casualties.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 in a London hospital after battling an undisclosed illness. Buhari's legacy is complex, marked by an authoritarian military regime in the 1980s and a later return to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was characterized by efforts to combat corruption and the Boko Haram insurgency, but also by significant economic decline and widespread insecurity. Despite a fraught tenure, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that President Trump's intention is to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than eliminate it entirely. Speaking amid criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem defended the administration's handling of the crisis, calling it the "best response" in years. She also addressed reports of unanswered calls at FEMA centers, dismissing them as "fake news." Her comments represent a potential shift in rhetoric from the administration, which has previously suggested phasing out the agency and reducing federal disaster relief funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, a meeting that comes as the administration considers a plan to sell weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Ukraine. This potential move is part of a broader strategy to increase support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. The meeting also coincides with a push in the Senate for a strong sanctions bill against Russia, which has widespread bipartisan support. The combination of potential weapons sales and severe sanctions signals a possible turning point in the U.S. approach to the conflict.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza on Sunday killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water, according to emergency officials. The Israeli military has since stated that the incident was the result of a "technical error" involving a munition that struck dozens of meters away from its intended target, an Islamic Jihad militant. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians and confirmed that the incident is under review. This strike occurs amid an escalation of Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, leading to numerous other casualties.</p>

          <p>The search for victims of the catastrophic July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, was suspended on Sunday due to a new flood threat. Heavy rain prompted a flash flood warning for the same area where the Guadalupe River's surge killed over 100 people and left more than 160 missing. Emergency crews and volunteer search parties were ordered to evacuate the river corridor as the National Weather Service warned of a dangerous and life-threatening situation.

          <p>White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett confirmed that President Trump's threats to impose steep tariffs on imports from Mexico and the European Union are serious. Hassett stated on Sunday that the tariffs will be implemented unless the administration receives better trade deal offers. This comes after Trump announced a 30% tariff on goods from the EU and Mexico starting August 1, escalating global trade tensions. European leaders are now working to find a solution before the deadline, while acknowledging that countermeasures remain an option if negotiations fail. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some Democrats are concerned that their strategy of focusing on Republican-led Medicaid cuts in a recent major bill might not resonate strongly enough with voters before the 2026 midterm elections. Because the most significant impacts of the cuts are delayed until after the election, there is a worry that the issue will feel too abstract for many voters not directly on Medicaid. Despite this, Democrats are moving forward with the messaging, hoping to replicate their 2018 success by highlighting the potential negative effects on healthcare, particularly in rural areas that rely heavily on the program.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a preliminary investigation into last month's fatal Air India crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have privately notified authorities that the fuel switch lock design on Boeing aircraft is safe. A preliminary report on the crash, which killed 260 people, had raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches. However, an FAA notification stated the issue is not considered an "unsafe condition" that would warrant a mandatory airworthiness directive. This comes as the Indian pilots' association calls for its inclusion as an observer in the ongoing investigation.</p>
