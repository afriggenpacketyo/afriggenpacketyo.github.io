          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges, including declining revenue and increased competition, further exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public dispute with President Trump. The conflict, stemming from policy disagreements over Trump's spending bill, escalated into a social media battle, causing Tesla's shares to plummet and erasing billions in value. This feud jeopardizes Tesla's relationship with the White House, potentially impacting future regulations, investigations, and government support. Additionally, Musk's controversial actions, such as endorsing a far-right German party, have led to protests and boycotts, compounding the company's woes and raising concerns about its leadership and brand image. The company faces hurdles in rolling out innovative EVs and navigating tariff concerns, prompting calls for board intervention to ensure Tesla's stability and future success. Optimism that the company can overcome its challenges remains cautiously low, as the business is facing a variety of factors that are not conducive to the company's stability.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian truck drivers involved in transporting equipment used in a recent drone attack on Russian warplanes were unaware of their cargo's true purpose. According to Zelenskyy, the drivers were simply performing their jobs, unaware that the mobile cottages and containers they transported were equipped with drones intended to strike Russian airfields. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that it damaged over 40 Russian bombers, a significant portion of Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Zelenskyy also emphasized that the operation was conducted using only Ukrainian-made weapons, without relying on equipment from allied nations. Ukraine wanted to make sure that the weapons used were made in Ukraine and that the line was clearly drawn as to which nation was responsible.</p>

          <p>A group of deportees are being held in a converted shipping container at Camp Lemonnier, a U.S. military base in Djibouti, East Africa, guarded by ICE officers. The migrants were rerouted to Djibouti after a federal judge blocked their deportation flight to South Sudan, leading to a legal battle that has reached the Supreme Court. Conditions at the base are described as dire, with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit and limited resources for both migrants and ICE officers. Concerns include exposure to malaria, proximity to burn pits, and potential terrorist attacks from nearby Yemen, with officers and detainees reporting illness and lacking adequate protection. The situation highlights the legal complexities and humanitarian concerns surrounding the Trump administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured nearly two weeks after escaping from an Arkansas prison, where he was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault.

Authorities confirmed his identity through fingerprint analysis, assuring the public that there is no longer an active threat. Hardin had been imprisoned since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder and later being convicted of the 1997 sexual assault of a teacher, crimes detailed in the HBO documentary "Devil in the Ozarks."</p>

The indictment, unsealed in Nashville, accuses Abrego Garcia of conspiring to transport undocumented aliens and playing a significant role in a smuggling ring involving women and children. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed Abrego Garcia was involved in the murder of a rival gang member's mother and solicited inappropriate pictures from a minor, allegations not included in the charging documents. Abrego Garcia's attorney asserts his client is not the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy and that the government disappeared him to a foreign prison in violation of a court order, emphasizing his right to defend himself before being punished.</p>

The court found that these spaces are not public forums and the White House has the discretion to determine which journalists are admitted. The decision stems from a dispute over the AP's Stylebook usage, specifically regarding the name Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the AP is not guaranteed special access and the administration aims to expand access to new media, while the AP says its news reaches roughly 4 billion people daily.</p>

          <p>The Organization of American States (OAS) has expressed serious concerns about Mexico's recent judicial elections, citing low voter turnout and a lack of awareness among voters. The OAS mission recommended that other countries in the Americas not replicate this model of judge selection. The election, which aimed to overhaul the judiciary, was marked by criticism over potential loss of judicial independence and politicization of justice. Observers also noted the distribution of "cheat sheets" promoting certain candidates and raised doubts about the autonomy of the Supreme Court due to the government's influence in the nominations.

          <p>Visitors attending the UK-wide Open Farm Day are being warned about the risk of cryptosporidium, a parasitic infection causing gastrointestinal illness. There were 17 outbreaks linked to farms in England and Wales in 2024, and inspection reports reveal that some farms have repeatedly ignored health inspectors' advice, allowing children to handle sick animals in unsanitary conditions. The organizers of Open Farm Sunday emphasize that participating farms have high health and safety standards. Cryptosporidium can cause severe symptoms and is spread through direct contact with animals or contaminated surfaces, posing a particular risk to young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. The owners of the farms are making sure that they are doing what they can to keep people safe.</p>

          <p>Despite significant gains in recent local elections, Reform UK is struggling to find partners to share council power, with no formal coalitions or deals in place. Reform UK has enough councillors to form minority administrations in some areas, but has been shunned or has avoided cooperation in others. Established parties view Reform UK's policies with suspicion, focusing on national issues like immigration rather than local concerns. In Cornwall, Liberal Democrats, Labour, and Conservatives refused to work with Reform UK, forming a minority administration instead, highlighting the challenges the party faces in translating electoral success into governing influence. The Reform party is finding itself in a difficult position as it tries to navigate the political landscape.</p>

          <h2>The Origin and History of Welsh Rarebit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 19:04:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Welsh rarebit, a beloved national dish of Wales, has varied origin stories, ranging from a poor farmer's substitute for meat to an English joke mocking the Welsh. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves suggests that cheese was a vital part of European diets, especially in Wales, where the dairy industry thrived, and that melted or roasted cheese became popular across all social classes. The name Welsh rarebit appeared later, with early English cookbooks using terms like Welsh rabbit for similar cheese on toast recipes. Rose Geraedts, who runs the International Welsh Rarebit Centre, believes that the dish became popular due to Wales' connection to cheese-making, despite its name being a sarcastic English joke, and it is a dish that many people enjoy.</p>

          <p>Police have concluded their search for Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal, with hopes of finding closure for the McCann family fading. The search was prompted by German prosecutors' belief that Madeleine is dead and that Christian Brückner is the suspect. Brückner is currently in prison for raping a 72-year-old woman in Praia da Luz in 2005, but is due for release soon. The Braunschweig prosecution team is seeking more evidence to charge Brückner, leading to the recent search of ruined farm buildings. The initial Portuguese investigation failed to preserve the scene adequately, and while a Metropolitan Police investigation began in 2011, it did not appear to have any identifiable suspects. The local people are hoping that her family will get closure.</p>

          <p>Walmart is launching new initiatives to attract younger shoppers, including a fresh advertising campaign, a clothing brand for tweens, and expanded drone deliveries, even as tariffs drive prices higher. CFO John David Rainey stated that tariffs have not changed consumer spending patterns, with shoppers prioritizing groceries over discretionary items. CEO Doug McMillon defended the decision to announce price increases due to tariffs, emphasizing the company's responsibility to communicate with shareholders. The retailer plans to offset cost pressures by selling more higher-margin items, such as apparel and home decor, and believes the new investments can help it win new consumers who have an outdated view of the retailer. Walmart is hoping to change how people perceive the store.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk, despite their different temperaments, formed a close relationship, but it eventually deteriorated due to policy disagreements and Musk's growing influence. Musk attacked Trump's spending bill and made personal attacks, leading to a public feud on social media. Trump and Musk were inseparable during the transition, but friction grew over time due to various clashes and Musk's government work. The White House built Musk a dignified off-ramp, but the split has forced Republicans to choose between Trump and Musk, highlighting the complexities of their relationship and the potential consequences for both parties. The relationship between the two men fell apart very quickly.</p>

The technology faces hurdles, including public concern following accidents involving self-driving vehicles, and the need for more specific applications like low-speed, last-mile delivery trucks.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing DOGE, a team led by Elon Musk, access to sensitive records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) during legal challenges. The conservative-majority court lifted an injunction that had restricted access, enabling DOGE to pursue its goal of targeting waste and fraud in the federal government. The lawsuit was brought by labor unions and an advocacy group, who argued that DOGE's access to the data could compromise the privacy of millions of Americans. Justice Jackson dissented, expressing concern that the court was granting special treatment to the administration. The public is split on whether or not the decision will be beneficial.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at a San Diego beach following a federal appeals court ruling that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional, deeming the teaching of yoga as “protected speech”. The court overruled a San Diego judge and sided with instructors who sued over the law banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. The city argued that the rule wasn’t specific to yoga but commercial activity, as the classes drew donations. A yoga instructor resumed teaching classes, stating that the group was targeted because wealthy homeowners in the area did not want people disturbing their oceanfront views, which has brought the community together.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He has been accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy over several years to move people from Texas to other parts of the country. El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to "facilitate" his return after he was sent to a mega-jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees. The case has been a point of contention for the US government.</p>
