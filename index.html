        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured victory in Monday's federal election, despite initial expectations of a Conservative win, due to U.S. President Trump's interference. Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose tariffs significantly influenced voters, overshadowing domestic issues like affordability and immigration. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was perceived as similar to Trump, potentially costing him votes. Voters emphasized the importance of Canadian sovereignty and the need for diversified global partnerships to mitigate the impact of U.S. policies, with Trump continuing to call for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state on social media.</p>

          <p>Walmart and other major U.S. retailers have reportedly instructed some manufacturers in China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States. This decision comes after a period of slowed shipments due to escalating tariff hikes between the U.S. and China. The costs of the new import duties will be borne by the U.S. clients. At least one exporter in Jiangsu has also been asked to prepare for a recovery in demand, suggesting a potential shift in trade dynamics despite ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's 'border czar,' defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting it was not an error, despite a prior 'withholding of removal' order protecting him from deportation. Homan claimed Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist, citing the administration's designation of certain gangs, including MS-13, as terrorist organizations. Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny any gang affiliation and note his lack of criminal record. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., leading to diplomatic tensions and legal battles, with a federal judge setting a deadline for the Trump administration's response.</p>

The investigations come amid ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard over diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and concerns about antisemitism on campus. The civil rights offices of the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services will examine Harvard's relationship with the Law Review and its selection policies.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is revamping its diversity, equity, and inclusion office, renaming it the Office of Community and Campus Life. This move comes as the Trump administration has been pushing to abolish DEI programs at universities. The decision follows similar reorganizations at other universities and is seen as an attempt to appease conservative critics who view diversity offices as promoting left-wing ideology. The Trump administration has also accused the Harvard Law Review of racial discrimination in journal membership and article selection.</p>

          <p>China is strategically using President Trump's tariffs as an opportunity to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market and develop a robust domestic consumer base. Beijing has implemented countercyclical policies, including a 10 trillion yuan debt swap plan for local governments, to stimulate domestic demand. These measures aim to enhance China's economic resilience and mitigate the impact of the trade war, allowing the country to pursue its growth objectives independently of U.S. trade policies.</p>

          <p>Early election results in Manitoba indicate that the Liberal party will form Canada's next government. CBC News projected the Liberals would win shortly after polls closed in most of Canada. The race in Manitoba will see at least two new members of Parliament sent to Ottawa, as incumbent candidates in Brandon-Souris and St. Boniface-St. Vital ridings did not seek re-election. Heading into the election, the Conservatives held seven Manitoba seats, the Liberals held four, and the NDP held three.</p>

          <p>A group of 35 legal scholars assessed President Trump's actions during his first 100 days, identifying potential constitutional violations and unlawful conduct. Concerns were raised regarding attacks on birthright citizenship, deportations without due process, targeting of law firms and universities, and impoundment of federal funds. The scholars expressed alarm over a disregard for civil liberties, political pluralism, and the separation of powers, characterizing the administration as potentially authoritarian.

          <p>President Trump has decided to provide some relief to automakers by easing tariffs on imported auto parts, a move seen as a retreat from his protectionist policies. Importers of foreign auto parts will be able to get some reimbursement from the government for tariffs for the next two years. The move aims to reward domestic manufacturers while giving time to invest in domestic plants, the announcement is expected ahead of a Michigan rally marking Trump's 100 days in office.</p>

The issue has become more frequent, compromising the freshwater supply for approximately 23,000 residents in Plaquemines Parish. The salt is corroding pipes, reducing water pressure, and raising concerns about lead contamination. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has built underwater barriers to prevent saltwater from flowing further north, but the threat remains serious.</p>
