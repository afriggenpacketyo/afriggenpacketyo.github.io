        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans have released their version of a major legislative package central to former President Trump's agenda, aiming for a vote before the July 4th holiday. The bill seeks to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase spending on border security and defense, and implement cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Key changes from the House version include adjustments to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, a higher debt ceiling increase, and a new provision for a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation. The legislation's path forward depends on navigating Senate rules and securing enough Republican support.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described fixing the country's "broken" benefits system as a "moral imperative," following a significant policy U-turn forced by a backbench revolt. Speaking at a Labour Party conference, Starmer affirmed that the welfare safety net would be protected but emphasized that it should not trap people who are able to work. The government recently conceded on plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) for existing claimants, but some MPs and unions are still pushing for more significant changes to the proposed reforms.</p>

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a Maryland couple who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on their journey ten years after the Supreme Court legalized it nationwide. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, their public advocacy helped pave the way for Maryland to legalize marriage equality through legislation and a referendum in 2012. The couple expressed both pride in their role and concern over recent challenges to marriage rights, emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance to protect hard-won equality.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has condemned alleged threats from Iran calling for the arrest and execution of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. Rubio stated the calls are "unacceptable" and voiced strong support for the IAEA's verification and monitoring work in Iran, urging the nation to ensure the safety of agency personnel. The condemnation follows recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and subsequent comments from Grossi about the significant damage and unaccounted-for nuclear material, which have heightened tensions between Tehran and the international watchdog.</p>

          <p>The recently concluded Supreme Court term, while lacking the blockbuster rulings of previous years, delivered a series of steady victories for conservative states and former President Trump's claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority expanded states' authority on issues like transgender medical treatments and funding for Planned Parenthood, reflecting a states-rights approach. Concurrently, the court has consistently sided with Trump's administration by setting aside lower court orders that blocked his initiatives, reining in the power of district judges without yet ruling directly on the constitutionality of the president's broad assertions of authority.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of Çatalhöyük in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal or matrilineal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried beneath the city's houses and discovered that while many occupants were unrelated, genetic connections were traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring tended to remain. The findings, which also noted more grave goods for females, challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, at least 81 Palestinians were killed and over 400 injured in Israeli strikes across Gaza within a 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near a stadium in Gaza City that was sheltering displaced people in tents, reportedly killing at least 11 individuals, including children. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope for a ceasefire within a week, and mediators are intensifying efforts to broker a deal. However, negotiations remain stalled as Israeli military operations in the region continue unabated.</p>

          <p>A driver's report of a baby tiger on the side of a highway in San Luis Obispo County prompted a response from the California Highway Patrol this week. A concerned motorist spotted what they believed to be a stranded cub along a remote stretch of Highway 166. However, when an officer arrived to investigate the unusual sighting, they discovered the animal was not a tiger but a deceased hawk. The California Department of Transportation was notified to remove the bird, closing the case on the zoological mix-up.</p>

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's success. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments suggested a more modest setback of only a few months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift their focus from facility destruction to the achievement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel as the primary goal. Questions also remain about whether Iran successfully moved its enriched uranium stockpile before the strikes occurred.</p>

The protesters have given the government an ultimatum to call for a snap vote or face a campaign of civil disobedience. These ongoing demonstrations were initially sparked by a deadly train station collapse last year, which was widely attributed to government negligence and corruption.

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is experiencing significant strain after President Cyril Ramaphosa dismissed a deputy minister from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party. In response, the DA has withdrawn from the president's "National Dialogue" initiative and threatened to withhold support for budgets led by ministers accused of corruption. The DA's leader, John Steenhuisen, accused Ramaphosa of "double standards" for not acting against corruption within his own ANC party. This public clash threatens the stability of the fragile government formed just over a year ago.</p>
