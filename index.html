          <p>OpenAI is launching new parental controls for ChatGPT, allowing parents to link accounts with their teenagers and manage features like chat history. A key feature will be a notification system that alerts parents if the AI detects their child is in "acute distress." This move follows a lawsuit from parents who alleged the chatbot encouraged their son's suicide, highlighting the growing scrutiny on AI safety for young users. The company is collaborating with mental health and youth development experts to shape these new protections.</p>

          <p>Residents in tourist hotspots like Mexico City and Barcelona are increasingly staging protests against the negative impacts of "overtourism," with some demonstrations turning destructive. Locals are expressing anger over rising living costs and strained infrastructure caused by an influx of tourists and digital nomads. While some experts believe these protests can raise awareness and prompt policy changes, others argue that the effects are often short-lived and symbolic. Academics suggest solutions like reducing short-term rentals and better integrating local communities into tourism planning to address the root causes of residents' frustrations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has tightened its restrictions on China's semiconductor industry by revoking a waiver that allowed major chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix to easily export U.S. technology to their Chinese facilities. This change removes their "validated end user" status, meaning future shipments will now require specific U.S. export licenses. The Commerce Department stated the move closes a "loophole" and aims to prevent the expansion or technological upgrade of chip manufacturing in China. While the financial impact on the companies is expected to be minor, it signals Washington's firm commitment to constraining China's local chip production capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior UK police chief has stated that the rising number of protests concerning the use of hotels for asylum seekers is placing forces under "chronic pressure." Chief Constable Gavin Stephens noted a significant increase in demonstrations this summer compared to previous years, often requiring large police presences to manage opposing groups. He called on public figures to help "reduce and diffuse tension" rather than spreading misinformation that can inflame the situation. The strain on resources has forced police departments to pull officers from other duties and rely on reinforcements from other regions.</p>

          <p>China has initiated a new seasonal shipping service to Europe, dubbed the "Arctic Express," which utilizes the Northern Sea Route to significantly reduce transit times. By navigating through the melting Arctic ice, the route bypasses traditional chokepoints like the Suez Canal, cutting the journey from Ningbo to Felixstowe, UK, from 40 days to just 18. This strategic move aims to expedite the delivery of time-sensitive cargo and reduce inventory costs for businesses.

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight aerial assault on Ukraine, deploying more than 500 drones and missiles primarily targeting civilian and energy infrastructure in western regions. Ukrainian air defenses successfully intercepted a majority of the projectiles, but impacts and falling debris caused damage in cities like Lviv and Lutsk. The scale of the attack prompted NATO to scramble jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as "demonstrative," stating they show Russian President Vladimir Putin's sense of impunity and the continued need for international pressure on Russia's war economy.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has strongly condemned the military parade held in Beijing, characterizing it as an exhibition of militaristic ambition rather than a commemoration of peace. The DPP accused Beijing of using the event to showcase the military force it employs to intimidate its neighbors in the Taiwan Strait and the South and East China Seas. Furthermore, the party criticized Beijing's historical narrative of the Second World War, labeling it a distortion designed to co-opt Taiwanese identity. The statement highlights the deep political and ideological divide across the strait.</p>

The company stated that strong trading, particularly in the U.S., has continued, and it does not anticipate a material impact from the tariffs in the near term. This resilience is partly attributed to brand partners increasing their inventories in the U.S. ahead of the tariffs taking effect. Following the update, Deutsche Bank upgraded the company's stock to a "buy," expressing confidence that the downside risk from the trade policy is more contained than the market perceives.

          <p>A U.S. judge's ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google has delivered a mixed verdict, allowing the company to avoid the worst-case scenario of a forced break-up. The court decided not to compel Google to divest its popular Chrome browser, a key demand from the Department of Justice. However, the judge did impose remedies, such as barring Google from maintaining exclusive default search engine contracts with partners like Apple and requiring it to share some data with competitors. While seen by many on Wall Street as a win, some legal experts argue the remedies could still meaningfully challenge Google's monopoly in online search.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Blocks Trump's Use of 18th-Century Law to Deport Venezuelan Gang Members</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of individuals accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The court determined that the wartime statute was not intended for use against criminal gangs in peacetime, blocking a key administration immigration policy. The ACLU praised the decision as a crucial check on executive power, reining in the administration's attempt to declare an emergency without judicial oversight. The case is expected to ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led House committee has publicly released over 33,000 pages of documents related to the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The release is part of a first batch of files handed over by the Justice Department following a subpoena, with the committee chairman stating the goal is "full transparency." However, Democrats on the committee noted that the vast majority of the documents had already been made public and did not contain new information like a client list. The release comes amid cross-party calls for greater transparency in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of security staff at the Houses of Parliament have begun strike action in a dispute over pay, annual leave, and working conditions. Members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union will walk out for two days this week and next, coinciding with Parliament's return from recess. The union states its members are angry over the removal of six days of annual leave from their contracts and stagnating pay. While Parliament officials expressed disappointment with the strike, they have implemented contingency plans with the Metropolitan Police to ensure security is maintained without disrupting parliamentary business.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economy expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts and marking its fastest growth rate since late 2023. The growth was primarily driven by strong domestic spending from both households and the government, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This robust performance comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates and sounded a more optimistic tone on the economy. However, some analysts caution that this may be a "high watermark" for growth this year, as business confidence remains shaky and the job market shows signs of cooling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China held a massive military parade in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, using the event to display its advanced military hardware and project its growing global influence. President Xi Jinping was joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, presenting a unified front that analysts see as an alternative to the U.S.-led world order. In his opening speech, Xi stated that humanity faces a choice between "peace or war," a veiled critique of U.S. foreign policy. The highly choreographed event was seen as a diplomatic victory for Beijing, demonstrating its strong regional alliances.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of conspiring against the United States alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. The accusation was made in a social media post as the three leaders attended a large military parade in Beijing. In his message, Trump also urged Xi to remember the "massive amount of support and 'blood'" the U.S. provided to China during World War II. The comments mark a sharp rhetorical escalation, framing the gathering in Beijing not as a commemoration but as the formation of an adversarial coalition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a strike on a vessel in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 people identified as "Narcoterrorists" from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. According to the president, the operation was carried out on his orders against a boat in international waters that was transporting illegal narcotics destined for the United States. This action represents a significant escalation in the Trump administration's pressure campaign against criminal organizations and the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro. The president warned that the strike should serve as a notice to anyone attempting to bring drugs into the country.</p>
