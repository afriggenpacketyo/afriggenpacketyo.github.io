          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:41:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's substantial offshore oil reserves. The deal proceeded after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's stake in the lucrative Stabroek Block oil field. While the decision is a major strategic victory for Chevron, the company anticipates some job reductions as it integrates Hess's operations. Exxon has stated it respects the ruling despite disagreeing with the panel's interpretation of the contract.</p>

          <h2>University of Michigan Survey Shows Consumer Inflation Fears Easing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the latest University of Michigan survey, consumer sentiment saw a slight increase in July, with inflation expectations falling to their lowest levels since February. The one-year inflation forecast dropped significantly to 4.4%, down from 5% in June, suggesting that consumer concerns about tariff-induced price hikes have diminished. Despite this improvement, the report notes that consumers still perceive a risk of future inflation, and overall sentiment remains below its long-term average. Economists view the downward trend in inflation expectations as an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of Ether and shares of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and Robinhood surged following the congressional passage of the GENIUS Act, a significant bill aimed at regulating stablecoins. Ether's price reached its highest point since January, and ETFs tracking the cryptocurrency saw record inflows, surpassing those of Bitcoin ETFs for the first time. The positive market sentiment was further bolstered by BlackRock's filing to add staking to its Ether ETF. In contrast, Bitcoin and its associated proxy stocks experienced a slight downturn during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley, who previously helped locate the remains of King Richard III, claims that the two young princes allegedly murdered in the Tower of London over 500 years ago actually survived. The book, "The Princes in the Tower," presents evidence gathered by the "Missing Princes Project," suggesting the traditional narrative of their murder by their uncle, Richard III, was Tudor propaganda. Langley argues that documents point to the elder prince, Edward V, living on under a different identity. While the theory has generated significant interest, some historians remain skeptical.</p>

          <p>Germany's production of strawberries and asparagus has fallen to its lowest levels in decades, according to the Federal Statistical Office. The decline is driven by farmers planting less of these crops, as they struggle to cover rising production costs, particularly for labor, with the prices consumers are willing to pay. This has led to a sharp drop in Germany's self-sufficiency for strawberries and has turned both items into increasingly expensive, luxury goods. While demand remains high for these seasonal favorites, growers say production is often only viable for premium sales channels like on-farm shops.</p>

          <h2>Trump Orders Attorney General to Seek Release of Epstein-Related Grand Jury Testimony</h2>

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court for the release of grand jury testimony related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The move comes after his administration faced significant backlash for a memo that concluded Epstein died by suicide and did not possess a "client list." This order is an unusual step, as grand jury materials are typically kept secret. A judge will ultimately decide if the testimony can be unsealed, a process that could take weeks or months and may face objections from individuals named in the proceedings.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's long-standing strategy of exploiting conspiracy theories has now turned against him regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. For years, Trump benefited from fictions like QAnon, which painted him as a hero fighting a "deep state" pedophile ring. However, his recent attempts to shut down inquiry into the Epstein files have been met with resistance from his own base, who have been conditioned to distrust official narratives. The author contends that Trump helped create a post-truth political environment that he can no longer control, exposing the limits of his ability to manipulate these narratives.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flood at Camp Mystic in Texas that killed 27 people is under investigation, with a focus on a failed 2018 effort to secure funding for a modern flood warning system. County officials were denied a state grant that would have paid for new river gauges and sirens along the Guadalupe River, a system proposed after a similar tragedy in 1987. Scrutiny is also falling on the camp director, who died in the flood, for waiting over an hour to evacuate after receiving a severe flood warning. The tragedy underscores the devastating consequences of inadequate infrastructure and bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their Glastonbury performance. The investigation was launched over comments made on stage, but police, after consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The group, which has been controversial for its pro-Palestinian stance, had called the investigation an act of "political policing intimidation." One member of the trio is still facing a separate terror-related charge.</p>

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated it is "very unlikely" that Chinese-funded factories in Mexico will be excluded from the trade benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Speaking at an expo in China, Deputy Commercial Counsellor David Trujillo suggested that the upcoming 2026 review of the trade deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting companies from specific nations. This would mean products would need a higher percentage of locally-made components to qualify for preferential treatment. The statement comes amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has mandated that former President Jair Bolsonaro must wear an electronic ankle monitor and is banned from using social media or contacting other individuals under investigation. The order was issued as authorities searched his home and party headquarters in connection with a probe into an alleged plot to overturn the 2022 election results. The measures are reportedly intended to prevent Bolsonaro from fleeing the country. The decision comes as U.S. President Trump has publicly supported Bolsonaro and threatened tariffs on Brazil to pressure authorities into dropping the case.</p>

          <p>Two-time founder Amy Shack Egan argues that the "hustle and grind" culture prevalent in the startup world is not built to accommodate the realities of motherhood. Egan, who is pregnant with twins while launching her second company, criticizes the expectation that founders must work around the clock and sacrifice their personal lives to be seen as committed. She points out that this culture places an even greater burden on female entrepreneurs, who often manage a disproportionate share of family responsibilities. She acknowledges that the system lacks the support necessary for more mothers to become entrepreneurs.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) in a federal filing with the Small Business Administration. The filing, dated in April, was made shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. An SDB designation, which can provide preferential access to federal contracts, requires a business to be majority-owned by individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged. The filing was submitted while Musk was leading a government efficiency initiative aimed at cutting federal agency spending.</p>

          <p>In the highly competitive streaming market, children's programming like "Bluey" and "CoComelon" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers and ensuring profitability. Industry experts note that kids' content is effective because it is less expensive to produce and has high re-watch value, which significantly reduces customer churn. Media giants like Disney, Netflix, and Paramount are leveraging their deep libraries of children's shows to keep families subscribed long-term. This strategy also involves partnering with YouTube, the dominant platform for youth viewership, to drive discovery and engagement.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported a 60% increase in serious water pollution incidents by water companies in England in 2024, reaching the highest level on record. Of the 2,801 total incidents, 75 were deemed to cause "serious or persistent" harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. A parliamentary committee has called the situation "woeful," blaming years of underinvestment and weak regulation.
