          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 02:17:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated Eubank vs. Benn fight, various boxing experts have weighed in with their predictions. Barry Jones anticipates a points victory for Eubank, citing his size and speed advantage, while Fabio Wardley believes the weight difference will be a significant factor favoring Eubank. Hannah Rankin expects a later-round stoppage by Eubank, emphasizing his experience. However, Adam Azim is backing Benn for a knockout win, and Hamzah Sheeraz is also leaning towards a Benn victory. Delicious Orie sees Eubank winning due to experience and a perceived mental edge. Optimism is high, but tempered by the inherent risk in boxing.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team is preparing for a crucial Women's Six Nations match against France, with a focus on a strategic kicking game. Coach Mitchell emphasizes the need for accurate kicking to win the territorial battle and shut down France's dangerous backs, particularly scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Fly-half Carla Arbez's kicking ability is also a key factor in France's attack. England's fly-half Zoe Harrison, known for her tactical kicking, will play a crucial role in finding space behind France's back three, potentially securing a starting spot before the upcoming Rugby World Cup.</p>

Eltahawy expresses frustration at the lack of outrage among white Americans, who she believes are too confident in the government and institutions to recognize the rise of fascism.

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, a growing separatist movement is gaining momentum, fueled by dissatisfaction with Liberal rule and US President Trump's comments about Canada becoming the 51st state. Some Albertans are calling for an independence referendum, while others suggest joining the United States. This 'western alienation' stems from a perception that Alberta's economic significance is overlooked by politicians in Ottawa. Premier Danielle Smith has warned of a 'national unity crisis' if Alberta's demands regarding environmental laws are not met.</p>

          <p>A Kyiv resident recounts a night of intense Russian shelling, questioning the possibility of peace as proposed by Donald Trump. The author describes hiding in a bathroom as missiles and drones strike the city, while news reports detail a potential peace agreement that would require significant concessions from Ukraine. The author argues that such an agreement would amount to a punishment for Ukraine and allow Putin to continue his aggression. Despite the devastation, the author finds a glimmer of hope in the resilience of Ukrainians.</p>

Poilievre, a long-time MP from Alberta, advocates for a low-tax, small government and has criticized Liberal policies.
