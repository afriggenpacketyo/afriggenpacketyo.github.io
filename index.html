          <p>Dan Norris, the MP for North East Somerset and Hanham, has been suspended from the Labour Party following his arrest. A party spokesperson stated that they were informed of the arrest and have subsequently suspended Norris, which also means he loses the party whip and cannot sit as a Labour MP. The Labour Party has refrained from providing further details, citing the ongoing police investigation. The suspension underscores the party's commitment to upholding standards of conduct while the authorities conduct their inquiry.</p>

          <p>The IRS is planning to cut its workforce by up to 25%, starting with the closure of the Office of Civil Rights and Compliance. The agency cites increased efficiency and effectiveness as the reason for the layoffs, which will be implemented in phases, with early retirement incentives offered to employees. Concerns have been raised that these workforce reductions could lead to delays during tax season, despite assurances from the Trump administration that tax return processing will not be affected. Several senior agency leaders have also resigned or been demoted recently.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports indicates that women may have more sensitive hearing than men, with gender and environment being the primary influences on hearing sensitivity. Researchers conducted hearing tests on 448 individuals from 13 global communities, measuring hearing sensitivity using transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). The findings revealed that women consistently showed higher sensitivity, averaging two decibels across all populations sampled. This difference could be attributed to hormonal exposure during development or slight structural variations in cochlear anatomy.</p>

The state emphasizes its commitment to complying with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and asserts that the administration's legal interpretation is flawed. This stance reflects a broader conflict between state and federal authority over education policy.</p>

While seemingly benign, the video highlights a shift towards a more palatable form of toxic masculinity that reinforces regressive ideas about gender roles. Hall's content promotes a Christian, puritanical lifestyle and a focus on self-perfection, positioning men at the center of the universe, served by obedient women. This subtle lean towards patriarchy is more dangerous than overt misogyny because it is easily dismissed as harmless.</p>

          <p>Economists are questioning the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions and results in inflated rates. The formula, which divides a country's trade deficit with the U.S. by its exports and then divides by two, assumes a lower elasticity rate than is accurate in practice. Adjusting for this elasticity would significantly reduce the tariff rates, with most countries facing the baseline 10% tariff. A report from the Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used by the Trump administration are higher than they are in reality.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has cautioned that Republicans risk a "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if President Trump's tariffs lead to a recession. Cruz also warned that retaliatory tariffs could trigger a trade war, harming the U.S. economy. He expressed concern that some within the administration want the tariffs to continue indefinitely. The comments reflect growing unease among Republicans about the economic consequences of Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <h2>Empty Nesters Encouraged to Become Foster Carers</h2>

          <p>Empty nesters are being encouraged to consider becoming foster carers, as they have "a huge amount to offer" children in need. The call comes amid a decline in the number of foster carers, leading to a crisis. Parents who started fostering after their own children left home shared their positive experiences, emphasizing the rewards of providing a loving and secure home. The Fostering Network, however, warns that government action is insufficient to address the shortage of carers.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza has reportedly killed at least 31 Palestinians, including many children, according to medics in the Hamas-ruled enclave. The Israeli military claims it struck a "Hamas command and control center" in the area and took steps to minimize harm to civilians. Hamas has condemned the strike as a "heinous massacre" of innocent civilians. The incident has further heightened tensions in the region, with both sides trading accusations and casualties continuing to mount.</p>

          <p>Michigan has joined 18 other states in a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order on elections, arguing that it violates the Constitution. The lawsuit seeks to block key aspects of the order, including requirements for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and the demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. The states contend that the order infringes on their authority to run their own elections. The White House defends the order as a common-sense measure to ensure free, fair, and honest elections.</p>

          <p>New tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from South Korea, including a 25 percent hike on K-beauty products, has prompted beauty enthusiasts to stock up. With the U.S. consumers' love affair with K-beauty fostered by years of free trade, the tariffs will test how much “soft power” Korea has accumulated here. One beauty influencer said on TikTok, “If you love your glow, get it now. This is your last chance before it becomes unaffordable.”</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is pausing shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on April 3. A JLR spokesperson said the company is working to address the new trading terms with its business partners, and the pause in shipments will add to fears over the impact of tariffs on Britain’s car industry.</p>
