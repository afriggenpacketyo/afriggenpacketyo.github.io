          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, has extended its injunction that temporarily prevents the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, sending the case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The majority cited that the government did not provide the migrants with sufficient time or information to contest their removals, emphasizing the importance of due process. President Trump criticized the ruling, while the ACLU praised the decision as a pause on deportations to a brutal foreign prison. The court's order does not prevent the government from removing the migrants under other lawful authorities.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin fisherman discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that sank in 1923, in Lake Michigan due to recent storms exposing it from the sand where it had been buried. The J.C. Ames, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the Great Lakes, used for moving lumber and transporting railway cars. Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before invasive quagga mussels destroy them.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to release audio recordings of President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden's handling of classified information. Republicans have been demanding the release of the audio, arguing it could reveal a decline in Biden's mental acuity. The decision comes as Democrats grapple with new revelations about Biden’s health in office, and efforts by his aides and other party leaders at the time to quash concerns about his ability to run for re-election. The Biden administration previously asserted executive privilege over the audio, but the Trump administration disagrees with those arguments.</p>

The indictment alleges that Navarro-Sanchez also trafficked firearms and humans, smuggled bulk cash, and trafficked drugs on behalf of the cartel.

          <p>A Republican-backed tax bill is touted by the White House as delivering permanent tax cuts and bigger paychecks, but analyses indicate that it disproportionately benefits the highest income earners. Households with over $1 million in annual income would see a 4.3% increase in after-tax earnings, while the lowest-earning 20% would receive a 0.6% increase. The fate of the bill is uncertain after some Republican members of the House Budget Committee voted against advancing the measure, citing insufficient cuts to federal spending. Some analyses also suggest that cuts to federal programs could leave low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" package of tax breaks and spending cuts has stalled in the House of Representatives due to Republican budgetary divisions. Several conservative congressmen are demanding steeper cuts to the budget bill, arguing that the current measure does not do enough to reduce America's public debt. A contentious item in the bill is the proposed cuts to Medicaid, with some Republicans seeking further reductions and others, like Senator Josh Hawley, warning against slashing health insurance for the working poor. The bill's fate remains uncertain as lawmakers struggle to reach a compromise.</p>

Her probation was revoked under Louisiana’s repeat offender law, after she had previously been spared jail time in that case. Colbert had been the last person seen with the reporter, Adan Manzano, who died from the combined toxic effects of Xanax and alcohol. This sentencing brings some measure of justice to victims who had previously reported Colbert's actions to authorities.</p>

          <p>The San Francisco 49ers and quarterback Brock Purdy have agreed to a five-year, $265m contract extension, including $181m in guaranteed money. Purdy, known as 'Mr Irrelevant' as the final pick of the 2022 NFL draft, has defied expectations by leading the 49ers to back-to-back playoff appearances. His new contract places him among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league, reflecting San Francisco’s commitment to building around him for the long term.

The conflict dates back to 2014, and Gates believes Putin wants Ukraine to be a client state of Russia.</p>

The study was one of the last produced by the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs eliminated those teams.

          <p>The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are now using various levers to upend efforts from Washington targeting states that provide state-funded benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans are driven by a belief that benefits for immigrants entice people to enter the country illegally. States are facing penalties for using their own funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants, costing states billions of dollars and potentially forcing them to cut services. The move is creating a split among Democrats, with some advocating for fighting for undocumented immigrants rather than retrenching.</p>
