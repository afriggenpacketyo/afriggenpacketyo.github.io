          <p>A four-year-old mystery surrounding a wedding crasher at a Scottish couple's 2021 ceremony has finally been solved, thanks to an internet sleuth. Andrew Hillhouse, the mystery man, was mistakenly at the wrong venue, realizing his error only when the bride walked down the aisle. His partner had provided incorrect directions to a different wedding two miles away. This lighthearted tale of mistaken identity provided a humorous resolution to a long-standing puzzle for the couple and their guests.</p>

Industry leaders, however, warn of significant challenges due to rising costs and regulatory pressures. This ambitious pledge aims to address a housing crisis but faces considerable hurdles in implementation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of the proportionality of Israel's military operation in Gaza, consulting numerous international law experts. The operation, launched after Hamas's 7 October attacks, has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, widespread destruction, and severe food restrictions. While Israel asserts its right to self-defense and adherence to international law, the vast majority of experts interviewed believe its actions, particularly the overall campaign, have been disproportionate. The article explores the legal complexities and the ongoing debate surrounding civilian harm and military necessity.</p>
