          <p>A Cessna 208B aircraft carrying skydivers went off the runway at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey. The incident resulted in injuries to all 15 people on board, who were transported to a local hospital with varying degrees of severity, though none were life-threatening. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the crash. This same aircraft was involved in a previous runway incident in July 2023, where a National Transportation Safety Board report cited the pilot's "inadequate landing flare" as the cause, adding a layer of concern to the current investigation.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that hormone therapy combining estrogen and progestin may increase breast cancer risk for women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women without a uterus, appears to reduce this risk. This finding refines previous understandings from a controversial early 2000s study, highlighting how the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Health experts emphasize that this treatment remains the most effective for menopausal symptoms and advise personalized consultation with a doctor to weigh individual risks and benefits.</p>

Abrego Garcia, who lost 31 pounds in two weeks, was brought back to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges and has pleaded not guilty.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminology PhD student accused of the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, has pleaded guilty to all charges in a deal to avoid the death penalty. The victims—Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogen—were killed in their off-campus home. During the hearing, Kohberger admitted his guilt, and prosecutors revealed he had planned the attack for months. The plea deal has divided the victims' families, with some expressing relief and closure while others felt let down, calling it a "deal with the devil."</p>

The incident, which occurred on June 20, resulted in an estimated £7 million in damages after the Voyager aircraft were sprayed with paint.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Donald Trump secured nearly half of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from 2020. Political experts suggest this rightward shift is not necessarily ideological but reflects a growing populist sentiment among Latino voters. Analysts point to disillusionment with the Democratic Party's economic and immigration policies as key drivers. Some argue that Democrats failed to develop a working-class agenda, while others note a desire among naturalized citizens to distance themselves from new immigrants, highlighting the complexity and evolving nature of this crucial voting bloc.</p>

The court determined that the president does not have the authority under the constitution or federal law to implement such a sweeping ban. The policy, issued on President Trump's first day in office, was challenged by several immigrant rights groups, including the ACLU. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the president cannot create an alternative immigration system that bypasses laws enacted by Congress.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of a major domestic policy bill includes a 1% tax on international cash transfers, a measure aimed at generating revenue and potentially discouraging illegal immigration. This "remittance tax" would apply to money sent abroad by both immigrants and U.S. citizens, with estimates suggesting it could raise $10 billion. Some experts believe the tax could deter illegal immigration by making it harder to send money home. However, others warn it could destabilize the economies of Central American countries reliant on these funds, potentially backfiring by spurring more migration. (not investment advice)</p>

The change would exclude damage to an animal's habitat, which advocates say is critical for the survival of the region's just 73 remaining Southern Resident orcas. These killer whales rely on Chinook salmon, another endangered species whose population is crashing due to habitat destruction. Critics argue that weakening habitat protections would pave the way for industrial development, jeopardizing recovery efforts for the orcas, salmon, and other species like the bald eagle.</p>

The trial featured conflicting testimony, with a co-conspirator claiming Monica directed the plot, while Baker, who had already pleaded no contest, testified she was not involved.

          <p>A group of former federal health officials has warned that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in fiscal year 2026 could have devastating consequences for American health. The proposed budget would slash CDC funding by 54%, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion, impacting state and local health departments that rely heavily on this support. Experts predict the cuts would dismantle successful programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention. They argue that instead of saving money, the cuts will ultimately cost American lives and damage public health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's latest intelligence assessment suggests that U.S. airstrikes last month on three Iranian nuclear facilities have delayed the country's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This evaluation is more measured than President Trump's claims of complete obliteration but more significant than an initial Defense Intelligence Agency report that estimated a setback of only several months. The updated assessment is reportedly based on material indicating the destruction of centrifuges at the key Fordow site. Meanwhile, Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, complicating further verification efforts.</p>
