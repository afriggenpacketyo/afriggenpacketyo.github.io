          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a 10% increase in tariffs on Canadian goods, citing a "fraudulent" anti-tariff advertisement aired by Ontario featuring former President Ronald Reagan. Trump criticized Canada for not removing the ad before the World Series, viewing it as a hostile act and a misrepresentation of facts. Ontario Premier Doug Ford had pledged to pause the campaign but allowed it to run during the World Series games. This escalation follows Trump's withdrawal from trade talks and previous tariffs on Canadian goods, intensifying trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Independent left-wing politician Catherine Connolly secured Ireland's 10th presidency in a landslide victory over rival Heather Humphreys. Connolly, a seasoned TD since 2016, garnered support from major left-wing parties and ran a campaign she termed a "movement." Her composed debating style and engaging social media presence, including viral athletic videos, resonated particularly with younger voters. Despite scrutiny over her outspoken pro-Palestine views and criticism of NATO, Connolly's win marks a significant shift, as she intends to make the largely ceremonial role her own.</p>

          <p>Tom Aspinall's first heavyweight title defense at UFC 321 ended in disappointment as his bout against Ciryl Gane was declared a no contest. An accidental double eye poke from Gane in the first round left Aspinall unable to continue, prompting the referee to stop the fight. A crestfallen Aspinall expressed frustration, stating he couldn't see, while Gane also conveyed his disappointment. The outcome means Aspinall retains his title but not through a decisive victory, a setback for the Briton who aimed to revitalize the heavyweight division.</p>

The independent candidate, backed by major left-wing parties, pledged in her acceptance speech to be "an inclusive president for all" and a voice for peace and neutrality. Her election marks a significant moment, as she takes over from Michael D Higgins, with inauguration set for November 11. Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other leaders congratulated Connolly on her clear mandate, despite an unprecedented number of spoiled votes.</p>

          <p>China's housing market is experiencing a significant downturn, marked by a surge in foreclosures and properties liquidated at substantial discounts on e-commerce platforms. An industry report indicates that judicial auction prices are at 77% of appraised value, the lowest in years, suppressing home prices and buyer sentiment. Economists estimate over a million properties could be added to auction lists this year, with some experts suggesting the total stock of foreclosed units has surpassed 4 million. This growing crisis draws comparisons to the 2000s US subprime mortgage crisis, raising concerns about potential financial instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum has moved some of its most valuable jewels to the ultra-secure vault of the Bank of France, located 500 meters away, after a daylight heist exposed significant security vulnerabilities. The "Souterraine" vault, 26 meters underground, already houses 90% of France's gold reserves and other national treasures, valued at an estimated €600 million. Last Sunday, masked thieves used an angle grinder and a mechanical ladder to breach the Gallery of Apollo, stealing €88 million worth of treasures, including items belonging to Napoleon's wife.

          <p>A 24-year-old Honduran man, Jose Castro Rivera, died in Virginia after being struck by a vehicle while fleeing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This incident marks the third known fatality of immigrants attempting to escape detention during the Trump administration’s intensified mass deportation crackdown. Previous deaths include a Guatemalan man fleeing a Home Depot raid and a Mexican farm worker falling from a greenhouse. Critics argue these raids, often involving masked agents, disproportionately target individuals with no criminal records, contradicting claims of removing "illegal criminals" and raising human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik has denied wrongdoing following the death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, calling it a tragedy while condemning critics for a "campaign of harassment." Kramnik had previously accused Naroditsky of online cheating without evidence, a claim that reportedly took a toll on Naroditsky's mental health. Police are investigating Naroditsky's death as a possible suicide or overdose. The chess community, including Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, has widely criticized Kramnik's behavior, leading the International Chess Federation to review his conduct.</p>

          <p>The recent daylight heist at the Louvre, where masked thieves stole nine "priceless" jewels in under seven minutes, has quickly become an internet phenomenon, spawning memes and widespread cultural fascination. While French police continue their investigation, collecting trace samples and recovering one damaged crown, brands and influencers have capitalized on the event for viral content. The public's obsession is partly attributed to the fantasy of the story and a desire for lighter news compared to massacres. Even celebrities like George Clooney have joked about the "thrilling" nature of the high-profile robbery.</p>

COO Michael Fiddelke, set to become CEO, is leading this initiative amidst declining sales and a stock drop of over 30% year-to-date.

While polls show mixed feelings about abandoning non-partisan maps, a growing majority plans to vote yes, largely motivated by a desire to "stick it to Trump."
