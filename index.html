          <p>After a three-day strike, NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) reached an agreement, ending New Jersey's first rail strike in decades. While the engineers approved the deal, train service will not immediately resume. NJ Transit needs approximately 24 hours to conduct safety checks and reposition equipment, so full service is expected to restart on Tuesday, May 20. In the meantime, the agency will continue to follow the strike contingency plan, which includes bus service from designated park-and-ride lots. </p>

          <p>Sichuan University in China faced backlash after announcing the hiring of Japanese archaeologist Kazuo Miyamoto, a prominent figure in East Asian and Eurasian steppe studies.

However, the announcement sparked controversy on Chinese social media, with commentators questioning why Chinese scholars were overlooked for the position. Subsequently, the university removed the hiring notice from its website, and neither Miyamoto nor the university has issued a response to the situation.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. The president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</p>

          <p>Prostate cancer experts say that while former President Joseph R. Biden’s diagnosis is serious, advances in treatment and diagnosis have significantly improved survival rates. Although the cancer has spread to his bones and is Stage 4, the most deadly stage, new treatments have changed the outlook for men with advanced disease. The first line of attack is to cut off the testosterone that feeds prostate cancer, and doctors have a range of drugs and therapies to manage the cancer. The infusion of federal research money, with Mr. Biden’s cancer moonshot effort, in large part led to this progress.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The cancer is described as an aggressive form of the disease, but is hormone-sensitive, meaning it could likely be managed. The former president is said to be reviewing treatment options with his family. Support from both sides of the aisle poured in after the news broke, with President Trump and former Vice-President Kamala Harris offering their best wishes.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at age 82, categorized as an aggressive form that has spread to his bones. The severity of symptoms depends on the location of cancerous cells and how advanced the disease has become. While prostate cancer is often curable if identified and treated early, in Biden's case, the goal isn't to cure the disease but to control it, slow progression, and preserve quality of life. His office said the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, meaning it should respond to testosterone-blocking treatment.</p>

          <p>GP patients to help NHS find more infected blood victims\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nGPs in England and their patients are to help the NHS find more victims of the contaminated blood scandal. It is thought thousands of people could have been exposed to the hepatitis C virus through contaminated blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s and 90s; part of a scandal which affected more than 30,000 people in the UK. From June, patients signing up to a GP practice, who received a blood transfusion before 1996, will be offered a test for hepatitis C. The BBC revealed the scale of undiagnosed cases last year, as people with life-threatening liver damage caused by the virus over many years continue to be identified.\n\n'Horrifying impact'\n\nHepatitis C can now be treated by modern anti-viral drugs to eliminate the virus for most patients. But if it goes undetected and undiagnosed there may not be any noticeable symptoms for some time and it can infect the liver and cause serious damage, leaving the organ beyond repair.\n\nFamily photo Maureen Arkley was diagnosed with hepatitis C more than 40 years after being infected in a blood transfusion\n\nMaureen Arkley, who died last year, was diagnosed with hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver in 2023, more than 40 years after she had an operation involving multiple blood transfusions. These were on her medical records but she was not told by her GP or anyone in the NHS that she could have been exposed to the virus. BBC News highlighted her case as one of many people let down by the lack of testing following the infected blood scandal. It is one of the biggest treatment disasters in NHS history - 3,000 people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products have died. Many of the victims were haemophiliacs, who were given infected blood products as part of their treatment. Many thousands more were given transfusions using contaminated blood after accidents, emergencies or childbirth. Maureen died in February 2024, five months after her diagnosis and 47 years after a blood transfusion infected her. "The end was utterly horrific, she weighed less than four stone when she died," her daughter Victoria told the BBC.</p>
