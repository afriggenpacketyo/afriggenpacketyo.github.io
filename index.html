          <p>Job Garcia, a U.S. citizen, recounts his experience of being arrested and detained during an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles. Garcia, who was filming the agents, claims he was tackled, arrested, and held at Dodger Stadium, where agents allegedly boasted about the number of immigrants they apprehended. He alleges that agents referred to those arrested as "bodies" and high-fived each other, which Garcia found deeply disturbing. After being released from a federal detention center, Garcia expresses concern over the agents' dehumanizing treatment and assumptions based on appearance.</p>

          <p>Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox, has been ordered to provide testimony in a lawsuit related to a shooting incident at Guaranteed Rate Field during a White Sox game in August 2023.

The incident, which remains mysterious, raised concerns about how a weapon was brought into the stadium despite the ballpark's prohibition of weapons.

          <p>All charges against Barry Morphew have been dismissed without prejudice, just days before his trial for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to finding Suzanne's body as reasons for the dismissal. The defense attorney maintains Morphew's innocence and criticizes the prosecution's case as manufactured. The case has been marked by bizarre twists and turns, including a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and mystery DNA, and the search for Suzanne's body continues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The ruling blocks the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard, while the Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's ruling. The conflict arose after the DHS accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the attempted revocation of its student visa system certification.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed a bill that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now awaits the governor's signature, which would make Rhode Island the eleventh state with such a prohibition. The legislation only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, similar to a law in Washington state. Critics argue that the ban will not curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil has been granted bail after being detained for over three months. A federal judge ruled that Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, is not a flight risk or threat. The Trump administration has labeled Khalil a national security threat and sought his deportation. Khalil criticized the administration for targeting him for protesting Israel's actions in Gaza. The White House maintains that the judge lacked jurisdiction to order Khalil's release and plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he might fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell, whom he initially appointed, for his monetary policy decisions. It remains unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to fire Powell before his term ends in 2026. Powell has stated he will not resign if asked. Trump's criticism centers on the Fed's interest rate policies, arguing that lower rates would stimulate economic growth, while the Fed prioritizes controlling inflation.</p>
