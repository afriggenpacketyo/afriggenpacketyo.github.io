          <p>China Evergrande Group has been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking a symbolic end for the once high-flying developer that epitomized China's economic boom before becoming the face of its property bust. With over $300 billion in debt, its default triggered a widespread, multi-year crisis, significantly impacting the country's GDP through falling housing prices, sales, and investment. Beijing is implementing measures like lower mortgage rates and considering state-backed takeovers of unsold homes to stabilize the market. Despite these efforts, the slow liquidation process leaves overseas creditors and hundreds of thousands of homebuyers facing uncertain prospects for repayment, with the adjustment not yet over.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent delays in student loan forgiveness, stemming from court actions and a defunct Biden administration repayment plan, could result in substantial tax bills for borrowers. The American Rescue Plan Act, which made forgiveness tax-free at the federal level, expires at the end of 2025, meaning debt canceled after this date could be taxed. With over 1.3 million applications pending, advocates warn that eligible borrowers whose relief is delayed beyond January 2026 may face unexpected federal and state tax liabilities, potentially totaling thousands of dollars. Lawmakers are urging the Education Department to expedite forgiveness to prevent this "penalty."</p>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a 6% decline to $4,548.32 on Monday, reversing gains from a weekend rally that briefly saw it hit a fresh record of $4,954.81. Bitcoin also fell over 1% to $111,501.74, reaching its lowest point since July 10. Both digital assets had surged Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated potential rate cuts, fostering a "risk-on" sentiment among investors. However, this recent market pullback led to the forced selling of over $245 million in long ETH positions and approximately $175 million in long Bitcoin positions within 24 hours.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has expressed significant concern over the U.S. labor market, hinting at potential interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Recent government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring during July, alongside downward revisions for May and June, indicating a cooling trend. Key red flags for workers include a substantial decrease in monthly job additions, a 64% surge in long-term job seekers over three years, and increasing difficulty for young workers to find entry-level positions due to economic shifts and AI. Experts anticipate continued challenges, advising job-hunters against complacency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has proposed deploying federal National Guard troops to Chicago, a move strongly opposed by Mayor Brandon Johnson, who deems it illegal and unnecessary. Johnson highlighted a decrease in Chicago's violent crime rates and criticized the President's actions as a potential precursor to a "police state," referencing similar federal deployments in Washington D.C. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also rejected the idea, expressing concerns about federal overreach.

          <p>The U.S. government has acquired a 10% equity stake in Intel for $8.9 billion, utilizing CHIPS Act grants and other awards. This investment, which President Trump lauded as a "great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL," signifies a notable shift in U.S. industrial policy towards active government involvement in the private sector. Intel, the only American company capable of advanced chip manufacturing domestically, will not grant the government a board seat. This move aims to bolster U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology amidst global competition, particularly as Intel works to catch up to rivals like TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

With 31 states and D.C. now requiring phone limits, early results from Australia show reduced distractions, improved learning, and increased socializing.

          <p>A tragic incident in Chicago's Kenwood neighborhood resulted in the death of a five-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself with an unsecured gun inside his apartment. The child, who had just started kindergarten, was rushed to Comer Children's Hospital but later succumbed to his injuries. A gun victim's advocate and Pastor Donovan Price emphasized the devastating impact on the family and highlighted the critical importance of gun safety measures, such as gun locks, to prevent similar tragedies.

          <p>Cambricon, a Chinese AI chip company, has surpassed liquor giant Moutai to become China's costliest stock, with shares jumping 11.60% to a record 1,384.93 yuan. This surge, which has seen the stock more than double this year and quintuple in the past 12 months, reflects a significant shift in investor focus towards the artificial intelligence sector. Analysts view Cambricon as a key player in China's AI development, particularly in software-hardware collaboration, which is expected to accelerate domestic AI chip substitution and reduce reliance on overseas computing power.

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly keen on signing Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie, identifying the Ecuador international as a priority for a left-sided defender this summer. The Gunners' recruitment staff have extensively scouted the 23-year-old, who has a 60 million euro (£52 million) release clause and is reportedly eager to leave the German club. Hincapie has made 166 appearances for Leverkusen, contributing to their Bundesliga and German Cup wins in 2023-24. Arsenal, having already spent over £200 million this summer, is now looking to offload players, with several defenders potentially available for transfer.</p>

          <p>The article questions whether leading AI companies genuinely prioritize American democratic values or primarily their own self-interest, despite their "America First" rhetoric. Tech giants like OpenAI and Anthropic frame AI development as a competition with China, warning of authoritarian AI, while simultaneously lobbying the Trump administration for deregulation and lucrative government contracts. Critics suggest this alignment serves business advantages, with initiatives like "OpenAI for Countries" potentially acting as user-acquisition strategies. The piece highlights a cognitive dissonance, as these companies remain largely silent on actions by the Trump administration that critics argue erode American democracy.</p>

          <p>An American man, identified as Martin D., has been indicted on espionage charges in Germany for allegedly offering sensitive U.S. military information to Chinese authorities. The suspect, who worked for a civilian contractor at an unidentified U.S. military facility in Germany from at least 2020 to early 2023, was arrested in Frankfurt last November. Prosecutors accuse him of repeatedly contacting Chinese intelligence in the summer of 2024 with his offer. German media reports suggest he did not manage to transfer any data before his arrest.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the gender disparity in high school football, questioning why tackle football is deemed too dangerous for girls, who are increasingly playing flag football, while remaining acceptable for boys. The author, a scholar of gender and sports, highlights the long history of adapting sports rules for girls based on perceived physical limitations. Given growing awareness of tackle football's long-term health risks, including CTE and Parkinson's disease, the piece suggests society should reconsider why boys are still encouraged to play a sport known to cause such harm, urging a shift towards flag football for all youth.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic are revolutionizing weight loss and show promise for various conditions, but a critical question remains: their long-term effects on human desire and emotions. While these medications effectively reduce cravings for unhealthy foods and substances, scientists are unsure if they might also suppress productive desires or alter the messy human experience of joy and pain. Researchers distinguish between "wanting" and "liking," suggesting GLP-1s primarily affect the former, but more studies are needed to understand if they merely lower the intensity of extreme cravings or broadly diminish all motivation.</p>

Countries like Australia and Canada have updated travel advisories, warning about potential device searches.

The piece highlights the influence of pro-Israel PACs in campaign financing, which rewards loyalty and punishes dissent.

          <p>Latino voters are central to ongoing redistricting battles in Texas and California, with both Republican and Democratic parties vying for their influence, often with miscalculations. In Texas, Republicans redrew congressional maps to gain seats, creating "Potemkin majority-Latino districts" that a lawsuit alleges dilute Latino power. Conversely, California Democrats aim to buttress their members by including more Latino voters in proposed districts. However, Latino voters have a history of political independence, often rejecting party assumptions. Their skepticism and shifting allegiances could determine the success or failure of these gerrymandering efforts in the 2026 midterms.</p>
