          <p>Germany is under pressure to honor its commitments to accept Afghan refugees, as approximately 2,600 Afghans await permission in Pakistan to travel to Germany. The incoming government is considering restricting acceptance schemes due to security concerns and shifting political priorities, leading to heated debate within Germany. While the Foreign Ministry asserts that security checks are conducted, conservative lawmakers are pushing for stricter asylum policies, influenced by crimes involving asylum seekers. Aid organizations warn that reneging on promises would damage Germany's international reputation, as many Afghans sold their belongings based on assurances of acceptance.</p>

The company's strategy focuses on prioritizing profitability over volume, leading to a 7% growth in transaction margin dollars. Total payment volume fell slightly short of projections at $417.2 billion, but Venmo revenue increased by 20% year-over-year, and Pay with Venmo transaction volume climbed by 50%.

          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will re-enter the cryptocurrency investing market after exiting in late 2023 due to regulatory constraints. Noto cites a "fundamental shift" in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration, particularly new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. SoFi plans to offer crypto investing by year-end and integrate crypto capabilities across its product lines within the next two years, potentially through acquisitions. Future products may include crypto-backed loans and crypto payments, as SoFi aims to leverage blockchain technology across its lending, savings, spending, investing, and protection services.</p>

Kneecap has defended themselves, claiming the footage was taken out of context and rejecting any intention to incite violence. Counter-terrorism police are assessing the footage, and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution.</p>

          <p>General Motors exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but is reassessing its 2025 financial guidance due to potential cost increases and industry uncertainty caused by Donald Trump's auto tariffs. The company's first-quarter adjusted earnings per share were $2.78 versus the expected $2.74, and revenue was $44.02 billion. GM is suspending additional stock buybacks until there is more clarity on the economic and regulatory environments. While GM believes it can offset 30% to 50% of North American tariffs, it is deferring significant manufacturing changes until there is more certainty.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article examines the legacy of American-era buildings in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), Vietnam, fifty years after the end of the Vietnam War. These structures, once occupied by U.S. agencies like the CIA and USAID, now house Vietnamese families and businesses, reflecting the nation's evolution from postwar deprivation to embracing free trade. Residents share their experiences of living in these buildings, bridging two eras and navigating the complexities of a nation shaped by war and division. The article also touches on concerns about potential tariffs imposed by the U.S., which some see as another form of abandonment.</p>

          <p>Former NFL running back Merril Hoge criticized Shedeur Sanders' NFL prospects, stating that while he is a good college quarterback, his accuracy and processing skills are only average for the NFL.

Despite Sanders being drafted in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns, Hoge believes he is set for "epic failure" and will set the organization back.

          <p>Chinese biotech giant WuXi AppTec reported a 28.4% year-on-year increase in revenue from US-based customers in the first quarter, despite facing increased scrutiny from Washington. The company's overall revenue for the quarter rose 21% to 9.65 billion yuan, with net profit surging 89%. WuXi has been caught in Washington's crosshairs amid rising geopolitical tensions and efforts to curb China's technological progress.

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring ideas to encourage marriage and higher birth rates, including a "baby bonus" of $5,000 to mothers. While baby bonuses are common in other countries, the proposal has ignited debate about the underlying political agenda, particularly concerning traditional gender roles and reproductive rights. Critics argue it distracts from deeper societal investments parents need, such as affordable childcare and paid parental leave. Despite the debate, fiscal conservatives' drive to cut federal spending makes even a modest baby bonus unlikely.</p>

          <p>A secret note was discovered inside a violin crafted by Franciszek Kempa, a Jewish prisoner in the Dachau concentration camp in 1941, revealing the instrument was "made under difficult conditions with no tools and materials." The violin's origins remained unnoticed for decades until art dealers in Hungary sent it for repairs. Kempa, known to the Nazis as an instrument maker, survived the war and continued making instruments before dying in 1953. The violin is now called the "violin of hope," symbolizing resilience in the face of adversity.</p>
