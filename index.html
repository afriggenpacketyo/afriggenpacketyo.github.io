          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of $4,000 an ounce due to investors seeking safe-haven assets amid global economic and political uncertainties. The rally has been fueled by concerns over trade tensions initiated by US tariffs and delays in economic data reporting caused by the US government shutdown. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe investment during market turbulence, attracting both retail and institutional investors. However, analysts caution that gold prices could decline if interest rates rise or geopolitical tensions ease, as seen in previous instances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a short-term solution to keep the WIC nutrition program running during the government shutdown. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump authorized the use of Section 232 tariff revenue to sustain the program, ensuring that low-income mothers and children continue to receive assistance. This decision comes after Leavitt accused Democrats of forcing WIC to run out of funds due to their actions during the shutdown. The White House has not disclosed the amount of tariff money being used, but the infusion is expected to cover costs for the foreseeable future. </p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois and are expected to begin assignments protecting ICE agents and facilities, prompting legal challenges from state and local leaders. The deployment follows orders from the Trump administration and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, sparking criticism from Illinois officials who claim they were largely left in the dark about the mission. A federal court hearing is scheduled to address a lawsuit seeking to block the troop deployment, while concerns arise over the lack of local knowledge and potential hazards to public safety. The Illinois National Guard has also been ordered to report for training, though their role remains unclear. </p>

This phenomenon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its orbit, known as perigee.

The name Hunter's Moon dates back to historic preparations for winter in the northern hemisphere, when people would hunt and preserve meats for the coming months.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, backed by President Trump, has won the Republican primary in a special election for a Tennessee House seat. He will now face Democratic state Representative Aftyn Behn in December. Van Epps secured the victory after receiving an endorsement from President Trump, which came after in-person early voting had already ended. The seat became vacant when former Representative Mark Green resigned, and the general election in December could indicate the popularity of President Trump's agenda. </p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is appealing a court order that restricts LAPD officers from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The appeal comes after a U.S. District Judge barred the LAPD from using less-lethal munitions against journalists and nonviolent protesters. The city argues that the ban is impractical and puts officers at risk in chaotic situations, claiming it's not always possible to immediately identify journalists. Lawyers for the journalists argue that the incidents leading to the injunction were deliberate and uncalled for.</p>

          <p>Delivery firm DPD has announced that drivers who chose not to work due to a pay dispute will return to work, as an agreement has been reached. The company did not confirm whether it has deferred a plan to cut pay for deliveries of small packages. Some drivers had refused to work for three days after DPD announced it would cut the amount it pays for deliveries of small parcels by 65p. The lower rate was intended to apply to those who are self-employed or franchised, which is the majority of DPD drivers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has again threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a law allowing the president to deploy military forces on US soil to quell domestic unrest. The Insurrection Act is a US federal law that gives the president the power to deploy the military or federalize national guard troops inside the US to quell domestic uprisings. The law enables troops to take part in domestic law enforcement activities such as making arrests and performing searches, functions they are generally otherwise prohibited from engaging in. Civil rights groups have long warned that the Insurrection Act gives the president broad authority to use the military as a domestic police force in ways the founding fathers did not intend.</p>

          <p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 have reached the lowest annual level since the early 1970s. Preliminary data indicates that Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 238,000 apprehensions, a significant decrease compared to the record-high levels under the previous administration. The Trump administration's strict policies at the border and within the U.S. have been credited with deterring illegal immigration. The shift has sparked debate, with some praising the increased security and others criticizing the policies as inhumane.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging Colorado's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors. The case involves a counselor who argues that the ban unconstitutionally restricts her conversations with young patients about gender dysphoria and sexual orientation. The central issue is whether the ban regulates professional conduct or speech, with the counselor arguing that it silences certain viewpoints. The court's decision could have implications for healthcare regulation and First Amendment rights.</p>

The Chattanooga Audubon Society has found the goats to be surprisingly effective in controlling the invasive species. This eco-friendly approach demonstrates the potential of targeted grazing for ecosystem restoration.</p>
