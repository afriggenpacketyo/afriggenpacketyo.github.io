        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that 60% of Singaporean workers are living paycheck to paycheck in 2024, a notable increase from 53% in 2021. This trend is attributed to the city's high cost of living, including expensive housing and import costs, which have outpaced real wage growth since the pandemic. Experts also cite a societal shift towards prioritizing experiences and immediate gratification over long-term savings. This financial pressure is particularly impacting middle-income earners and younger generations, who feel less urgency to save.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a six-year plagiarism lawsuit against Pinkfong, the creators of the global hit 'Baby Shark.' US composer Jonathan Wright claimed copyright infringement, arguing his 2011 version of the folk song was substantially altered. However, the court upheld lower rulings, stating Wright's interpretation lacked sufficient originality to be protected as a separate work. This verdict confirms that Pinkfong's immensely popular 2016 rendition, streamed billions of times, is an arrangement of a public domain folk song.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has directed state police to launch a criminal investigation into allegations that staff at Centreville High School arranged and funded abortions for minor students without parental consent in 2021. Reports suggest school administrators may have been aware and public funds potentially misused. Fairfax County Public Schools initiated its own external investigation, stating such actions would be unacceptable. Pro-life groups have condemned the alleged 'state-funded child exploitation,' calling for accountability.</p>

          <p>BTecs, or Business and Technology Education Council qualifications, are practical courses assessed through exams, coursework, projects, and sometimes placements. Level 2 BTec Firsts are equivalent to GCSEs, while Level 3 BTec Nationals can be taken alongside or instead of A-levels. These qualifications are graded from Pass to Starred Distinction and serve as a pathway to university or direct employment, particularly popular among white working-class students. Recent government decisions have preserved funding for many key BTec courses, preventing their earlier planned scrapping.</p>

          <p>Startup Voltify, founded by Daphna Langer and Alon Kessel, seeks to transition the $80-billion U.S. freight rail industry from diesel to rechargeable batteries within a decade. Their 'VoltCars' are sodium-ion batteries designed to connect to existing locomotives, potentially saving rail companies billions and reducing emissions significantly. Despite initial industry skepticism regarding charging and power supply, Voltify is developing an algorithm to forecast energy demands and building solar-powered microgrids.

          <p>UK university tuition fees in England and Wales have increased to £9,535 annually, with maintenance loans also rising to help with escalating living costs. Universities faced funding pressures after a fee freeze, leading to concerns about cuts and fewer international students. While a degree generally leads to higher earnings, real graduate wages have declined, and financial outcomes vary significantly by subject and institution. Many students now work during term time, and eligibility for grants and hardship funding varies across the UK nations.</p>

While generally accepted, many employees keep these arrangements discreet from their companies due to 'policy grey zones' concerning expenses and liability.

Locals view Russia not as an abstract enemy but a close neighbor, leading to satirical concerns about being 'sold back' to Russia, referencing Alaska's history. While some enjoy the city's increased profile, others are wary of potential negative outcomes from the high-stakes diplomacy, especially given Putin's international arrest warrant.

These new rules, introduced in March, have reportedly prevented major NGOs from delivering vital supplies, leading to severe shortages in hospitals and increased deaths from hunger.

          <p>A Menifee police officer, Juan Pesina, has been arrested on suspicion of committing multiple sexual assaults while on duty, with additional alleged off-duty incidents in 2023 and 2024. The Menifee Police Department received a complaint, leading to a preliminary investigation that prompted them to request an impartial probe by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department. Pesina faces charges including sexual assault, sodomy, and forced oral copulation. Authorities believe there may be more victims and are urging anyone with information to come forward.</p>

          <p>Eighty years later, residents of Kumagaya, Japan, reflect on the devastating US firebombing that occurred just 12 hours before Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II. On August 14-15, 1945, nearly 90 B-29 bombers dropped napalm, killing at least 260 people and destroying 75% of the city. Survivors recount the horror, with one calling the tragedy 'utterly foolish' given the imminent end of the war. Despite the immense suffering, many express no animosity towards the US, attributing the event to the momentum of war and the unfortunate timing.</p>

          <p>First lady Melania Trump has demanded that Hunter Biden retract comments linking her to convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, threatening legal action if he fails to comply. Biden, in a recent interview, alleged that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim attributed to author Michael Wolff. Melania Trump's lawyer stated the comments are false, defamatory, and caused 'overwhelming financial and reputational harm.' The Trumps have consistently maintained they were introduced by a modeling agent in 1998, not Epstein.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops have been deployed to Washington D.C. following President Trump's order to address crime, prompting strong rejection from Mayor Muriel Bowser, who labels it an 'authoritarian push.' Armored vehicles appeared at urban centers and tourist sites, with 800 Guard troops and 500 federal law enforcement agents expected. While Trump claims crime is 'out of control,' D.C. police data shows violent offenses fell in 2024 and continue to decline in 2025. The deployment has led to numerous arrests, but raises concerns about federal overreach into local governance.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reports a significant increase in chikungunya virus cases in the UK, with over 70 infections in the first half of this year, more than double the previous year. All cases are linked to travel, primarily from the Indian Ocean region, including India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius, where an outbreak is ongoing. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne virus can cause severe joint pain that may persist for years. UKHSA advises travelers to take precautions against mosquito bites, such as using repellent and bed nets, and to check travel health advisories.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to relax environmental regulations for commercial spaceflight, aiming to substantially increase rocket launches by 2030. The order directs the US transportation secretary to expedite or eliminate environmental reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for launch permits. This move is expected to benefit private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, which have faced criticism for environmental impacts, including launchpad destruction and harm to endangered species. Environmental groups condemn the order, warning it jeopardizes people and wildlife by allowing agencies to disregard bedrock environmental laws.</p>

The 2-to-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the international aid groups challenging the freeze lacked legal standing. The funds, totaling nearly $4 billion for global health and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, were deemed 'wasteful' by Trump, who dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. The dissenting judge argued the ruling raised constitutional concerns about the President's power over appropriated funds. (not investment advice)</p>

Tindall was arrested on suspicion of felony illegal sales of psilocybin mushrooms.

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have sparked online speculation about 'zombie-rabbits.' Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the images are real, explaining the rabbits suffer from Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively harmless disease. Spread by fleas, ticks, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact, the growths typically disappear as the rabbit's immune system fights the virus. The condition, primarily found in the Midwest, is believed to have inspired the mythical 'jackalope' and has contributed to scientific understanding of cancer-linked viruses. People are advised not to touch infected animals.</p>
