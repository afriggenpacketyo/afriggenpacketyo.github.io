          <p>Amazon is rolling out 'Hear the Highlights,' an AI feature that generates audio summaries for products using catalog data, customer reviews, and web information. The tool, now available to all U.S. customers on the mobile app, aims to simplify shopping by distilling thousands of reviews into concise audio clips. While this feature could significantly improve accessibility for visually impaired shoppers, critics express concern that the AI-generated summaries may lack the nuance of human experiences. Experts warn that by blending marketing language with genuine user opinions without attribution, the tool could overlook critical negative feedback and inadvertently mislead consumers.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave increased by nearly 8% after the company revealed a significant agreement with Nvidia. The deal obligates Nvidia to purchase at least $6.3 billion of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032, highlighting the strong relationship between the two companies. As CoreWeave is a major customer for Nvidia's GPUs and Nvidia is a key investor, this news has bolstered investor confidence. The arrangement has helped CoreWeave's stock triple in value since its March IPO, pushing its valuation over $58 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is set to vote on the confirmation of Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, just before the central bank's upcoming policy meeting. Miran, currently the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisors, has stated he would take an unpaid leave of absence rather than fully resign if confirmed. This has intensified concerns among critics about the Federal Reserve's political independence, especially amid Trump's public pressure for interest rate cuts. Miran's term would be short, lasting until January 31, filling a seat vacated by a recent resignation.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy is expected to miss two to four weeks after sustaining a high-ankle sprain during a recent game against the Atlanta Falcons. The injury occurred after McCarthy was sacked six times in the 22-6 loss, adding to a difficult start for the second-year player. After missing his entire rookie season with a torn meniscus, this setback marks another challenge in his professional career. Veteran quarterback Carson Wentz is slated to start for the Vikings in McCarthy's absence, as the team also deals with an injury to running back Aaron Jones Sr.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed five new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), just before a key meeting on fall COVID-19 booster shots. This follows his controversial decision in June to purge the committee of all previous appointees, which has raised concerns among public health experts about the panel's scientific integrity.

          <p>Reverend William Barber, a prominent social justice activist, has strongly condemned the recent murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, calling it a "brutal, ugly" act. Speaking at an event, Barber urged a universal denunciation of all political violence, regardless of the target's political affiliation. He also took the opportunity to critique what he termed "religious nationalism," arguing that using faith to justify injustice or "sanctify wrong" is a dangerous perversion of religious principles. Barber's comments aim to foster a broader conversation about morality in public life and the rejection of violence across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, primarily fueled by voters' concerns over the city's affordability. The survey reveals that a desire for change is a more potent factor for voters than a candidate's experience, which benefits Mamdani. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo shows more competitive numbers among voters who prioritize crime, but this issue is currently secondary to economic pressures. The poll also highlights that many voters, particularly Mamdani's supporters, prefer a mayor who will oppose President Trump, reflecting the influence of national politics on the local election.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of over 2,200 federal officers and National Guard members to Washington, D.C., has coincided with a reported drop in crime, but experts question its sustainability. Critics argue the crackdown could be counterproductive, disrupting the city's economy and eroding trust between the community and law enforcement. The heavy federal presence has reportedly led to decreased foot traffic at restaurants and created fear among immigrant communities, potentially hindering cooperation with police on other crimes. The article suggests that while the surge provides a short-term appearance of order, it may undermine the very community-based factors that contribute to long-term public safety.</p>

The proposed change would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), where Republicans currently hold a majority.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate, homeowners may wonder about the impact on mortgage costs. The Fed's rate directly affects short-term loans between banks, but its influence on long-term mortgage rates is indirect. Fixed-rate mortgages typically align more closely with the 10-year Treasury note yield, which reflects long-term economic outlooks and investor sentiment. While mortgage rates have already slightly decreased in anticipation of the Fed's decision, experts advise that homeowners should not expect an immediate, significant drop following the official announcement, as the market has already priced in the cut.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to soon decide on a critical case concerning President Trump's authority to fire members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. The case, Cook v. Trump, stems from the president's attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, challenging the long-standing independence of the central bank. A ruling in Trump's favor would affirm the 'unitary executive' theory, granting the president direct control over monetary policy, which could have profound consequences for the U.S. economy. This legal showdown follows a recent Court decision that cryptically suggested the Fed might be exempt from direct presidential control, making the outcome highly anticipated.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel announced that DNA evidence has linked 22-year-old Tyler Robinson to the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In a television interview, Patel stated that Robinson's DNA was found on a towel wrapped around the rifle used in the attack and on a screwdriver recovered from the crime scene. Patel also confirmed that investigators found forensic evidence of a note, allegedly written by the suspect before the shooting, which stated his intention to "take out Charlie Kirk." This development provides crucial evidence in the case, as the suspect has reportedly been uncooperative with authorities since his arrest.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has laid off 500 workers from its data annotation team, a group responsible for training its Grok chatbot. The company described the move as a "strategic pivot" to prioritize specialist AI tutors over generalist roles, according to an internal email. This workforce reduction comes amid a recent leadership shake-up within the same team. In a public statement, xAI indicated it plans to expand its specialist team tenfold, suggesting a significant shift in its approach to developing Grok, which Musk launched as a competitor to models from OpenAI and Google.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated this week, savers are looking for ways to lock in high returns before they decline further. Placing $15,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD) can still yield significant interest, though rates are expected to fall. For example, a 1-year CD at a rate of 4.25% could earn approximately $637.50, while a 3-year CD at 3.97% could generate over $1,850 in guaranteed interest. Because CD rates are fixed for the term, they offer a stable investment vehicle to protect savings from the effects of falling rates and market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Portuguese maritime authorities rescued nine people from two separate sailboats after their vessels were attacked by orcas near Lisbon. These incidents are the latest in a series of increasingly frequent interactions between orcas and boats in the waters off Portugal and Spain. In one case, five people had to abandon their boat and were picked up by another vessel, while the other four-person crew was escorted to a nearby port. No injuries were reported in either attack. The pattern of orca ambushes in the region has puzzled scientists and concerned sailors navigating through the Strait of Gibraltar.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has announced that Washington and Beijing have reached a "framework" agreement regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. The deal, established during trade talks in Madrid, is intended to pave the way for American ownership of the popular social media app to address national security concerns. A looming deadline has pressured TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. division or face a ban. While President Trump confirmed the talks went well, Chinese officials stated that no deal would be finalized at the expense of Chinese companies' interests, leaving the final details to be confirmed.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a number of individuals have faced professional repercussions for their public comments about his death. A sports reporter, a university employee, a political analyst, and a U.S. Secret Service agent are among those who have been fired or placed on leave. Legal experts note that private employers generally have the right to terminate employees for public statements that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents highlight the growing debate over free speech, political violence, and the consequences of expressing controversial opinions in a highly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>The IRS deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a crucial date for freelancers, self-employed individuals, and those with investment income. Tax experts advise that this year's payments may be more complicated due to President Trump's recent tax changes, which could lead some taxpayers to overpay if their paycheck withholdings have not been adjusted. To avoid underpayment penalties, filers should adhere to safe harbor rules by paying at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's. Tax professionals recommend running projections to ensure payments are accurate for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor known for her work on the Jeffrey Epstein case and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, is suing the Department of Justice for her job back. Her lawsuit alleges that her termination in July by the Trump administration was "unlawful and unconstitutional," claiming she was fired without legitimate cause. The suit posits that the dismissal was motivated either by her father's contentious relationship with President Trump or her perceived political beliefs. This legal action adds to a growing number of lawsuits from former DOJ employees who were terminated during Trump's second term.</p>
