        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many tariffs imposed by President Trump are not legally permissible, dealing a significant blow to his signature trade strategy. The court found that the president exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, stating that the law does not grant unlimited power to levy tariffs. While the ruling does not immediately block the duties, it directs a lower court to reevaluate whether a universal injunction is appropriate. The Trump administration has criticized the decision as partisan and vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, traveling from Peru to Australia in 139 days. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean rowed over 9,000 miles non-stop, becoming the first team to complete the full crossing from South America to Australia. The journey, which included overcoming storms and injuries, also served as a fundraiser for clean water projects, raising over £700,000. The trio broke the previous record of 160 days, which was set by a solo rower in 2014.</p>

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, "The Anthropocene Illusion," examines the contrived and often paradoxical ways humans interact with the natural world they are simultaneously altering. Nelson spent six years traveling to 14 countries, capturing images of curated and hyper-managed versions of nature, from staged tourist safaris in Kenya to elephants chained underwater for Instagram photos in Sri Lanka. The project highlights the irony of creating artificial monuments to the very environments and species being lost, serving as a commentary on humanity's disconnect from genuine wilderness and the consequences of environmental destruction.</p>

Two of the victims, Fergus Ward and Lewis Knox, were regular first-team members of the Fort William Shinty Club, which described the loss as a profound blow to the community. The club proceeded with its scheduled games as a way to honor the teenagers' memory. The incident has prompted an outpouring of grief from local sports clubs, schools, and political leaders, including First Minister John Swinney, as police continue to investigate the circumstances of the crash.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marking ten years in power, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has overseen a period of rapid and profound transformation within the Kingdom. Key changes include significant advancements in women's rights, such as the right to drive and greater participation in the workforce, and the sidelining of the religious police, which opened up public social spaces. The reforms also feature a major economic restructuring aimed at reducing oil dependency through mega-projects like NEOM and the growth of the Public Investment Fund.

          <p>On the eve of a state visit to China, Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two nations while condemning what he called "attempts to distort" the history of World War II. Putin is scheduled to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit and hold bilateral talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In his statements, Putin emphasized a common stance against what he termed "discriminatory sanctions," referring to Western economic penalties imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, and highlighted the close cooperation on political, security, and economic fronts.</p>

          <p>Wales is facing an early exit from the Women's Rugby World Cup after a decisive 42-0 loss to Canada, who secured their place in the knockout stage with a dominant six-try performance. The world's second-ranked Canadian team established control early, securing a bonus point by halftime with tries from McKinley Hunt, Alysha Corrigan, and Asia Hogan-Rochester. Despite a spirited effort, the Welsh side was outmatched and unable to score. Wales' progression in the tournament now depends on the outcome of the Fiji versus Scotland match, an unlikely scenario.</p>

While the university's tuition is over $65,000, the average annual cost for students receiving financial aid is just $10,555. Graduates go on to earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade after attending. The list, which also includes Caltech and MIT, highlights how generous financial aid policies at well-endowed private institutions can lead to better financial outcomes for graduates compared to even the top-performing public colleges.

He noted that public trust in government plummeted during the Vietnam War and Watergate eras and has remained low ever since.

This decline is attributed to concerns over corporate governance, including a board structure seen as management-friendly and high executive compensation. Elliott is expected to push for changes to improve governance and capital allocation, potentially making Rexford an attractive acquisition target for strategic investors or private equity.

          <p>President Trump's recent actions targeting the Federal Reserve, including the attempted removal of Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-standing political independence. Experts warn that gaining partisan control over the Fed's Board of Governors would not only influence interest rate decisions but also grant the executive branch power over bank regulation and the nation's financial infrastructure. While the administration frames its moves as necessary reform, critics argue it could erode the Fed's credibility, politicize monetary policy, and risk long-term economic instability similar to that seen in countries with less independent central banks.

After his family's CPR training saved his life, he spent weeks on life support before becoming stable enough for a dual heart and kidney transplant. Eighteen months later, Reid has made a remarkable recovery, returning to his pulpit and even participating in a 5K run at the hospital where he was treated.</p>

          <p>The Indian restaurant scene in the U.S. is undergoing a significant transformation, moving beyond takeout and buffets to embrace upscale and fine-dining experiences. Restaurateurs like Vikas Khanna, whose New York establishments Junoon and Bungalow have seen massive success, are leading a trend toward more sophisticated and regionally specific Indian cuisine. This growth is fueled by younger consumers' interest in global flavors, a rising and affluent Indian American population, and increasing investor attention. Market data shows a steady increase in new and upscale Indian restaurant openings, indicating a sustained shift in the American culinary landscape.</p>

          <p>U.S. authorities are increasingly alarmed by the growing interest among far-right extremist groups in using commercially available or homemade drones as weapons for domestic attacks. Online chatter within these circles frequently references the effective use of first-person viewer (FPV) drones in global conflicts, viewing them as critical tools for a potential insurgency against the U.S. government. The FBI has expressed major concerns about accelerationist neo-Nazi sects targeting critical infrastructure, a threat amplified by the accessibility of drone technology. This trend points to a dangerous evolution in the capabilities of domestic terrorist movements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's executive order directing federal officials to prosecute flag-burners is likely to be legally ineffective and may even backfire, according to this legal analysis. The Supreme Court has twice ruled, in cases from 1989 and 1990, that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. The article argues that attempting to use content-neutral laws, such as public burning prohibitions, to target flag-burners for their message would open the door to a "selective prosecution" defense. The author concludes that the order is an empty threat that will not expand the government's power to punish the act.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the University of California system should legally challenge the Trump administration's freezing of hundreds of millions in research grants rather than negotiate a settlement. The author, a co-counsel in a similar successful lawsuit brought by Harvard, contends the administration's actions are illegal, violating federal law and the First Amendment by targeting research based on perceived viewpoints. The writer warns that settling would amount to extortion, set a dangerous precedent, and betray the university's values, urging officials to fight in court to protect academic freedom and public funds.</p>

          <p>Following a tragic school shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, this opinion piece reflects on the repetitive cycle of gun violence in American schools. The article highlights the words of the school's principal, Matthew DeBoer, who shared an African proverb: "When you pray, move your feet." This serves as a call to action, urging the public and officials to go beyond thoughts and prayers and take concrete steps to prevent future tragedies. The author emphasizes the heartbreaking reality that such events have become commonplace, dulling the impact of words like "tragic" and "outrageous" through sheer repetition.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed links between several major sportswear brands, including Chinese companies Li-Ning, Anta, and 361 Degrees, and forced labor programs in China's Xinjiang region. These brands, which sponsor numerous NBA stars, have been connected to factories participating in the government's labor transfer scheme, which moves Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to work in facilities across the country. The report also presents evidence linking Nike to a manufacturer that has historically used workers from this program. The findings raise serious ethical questions about the league's and players' commercial ties to companies implicated in human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that beta-blockers, a class of drugs widely prescribed after a heart attack for decades, may offer no benefit to most patients and could increase health risks for certain women. A study found that women with normal heart function post-heart attack who took beta-blockers had a significantly higher risk of a second heart attack, hospitalization, or death compared to those not on the drug. The findings apply to patients with preserved heart function, a group that now includes most survivors due to advances in immediate treatments like stents. Researchers state these results will likely reshape international clinical guidelines.</p>

          <p>This analysis posits that a key difference between China's rapid infrastructure development and America's slower pace lies in their societal frameworks: China is run by engineers, while the U.S. is a lawyerly society. China's leadership, often composed of trained engineers, approaches societal issues as technical problems to be solved, resulting in massive, swift projects like high-speed rail and bridges, but also brutal social engineering like the one-child policy. Conversely, America's legalistic culture, while protecting pluralism, can lead to paralysis and gridlock, making it difficult to build at scale and address pressing needs like housing and decarbonization.</p>

Newcomers like Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following through social media appeal and a diverse menu that includes various matcha drinks, which Costa does not offer. Analysts suggest that the rise of home coffee machines and a crowded market of artisanal shops mean large chains must innovate to justify their price point. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, has acknowledged the brand's underperformance and is reportedly exploring a potential sale.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that while some recent, small-scale studies on guaranteed income have shown lackluster results on secondary metrics like health and employment, cash transfers remain a proven and effective anti-poverty tool. The author points to decades of research showing that programs like Social Security and tax credits lift millions out of poverty annually. The recent pilot programs' limited impact can be attributed to their small scale and the context of a broader cost-of-living crisis, where a few hundred dollars cannot overcome systemic issues like unaffordable housing and childcare. The core function of giving people money—reducing poverty—remains successful.</p>
