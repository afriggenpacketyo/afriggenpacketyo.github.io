          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 15:10:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for the space infrastructure company Rocket Lab increased by 8% on Monday, extending a significant rally over the past two months. This surge is attributed to a series of successful launches, including deploying two rockets from one site in 48 hours, and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to deploy navigation satellites. The company, which now has a market value over $19 billion, reports it is producing a new Electron rocket every 15 days to meet rising demand in the increasingly competitive space industry. This recent performance builds on a 63% year-to-date gain for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News feature highlighted two uplifting stories from viewers, showcasing resilience and kindness in local communities. One story followed Jessica Caldwell, a Texas custodian and mother of four, who successfully earned four college degrees over a decade while working full-time overnight shifts at the very university she attended. The other featured a postal worker, Ian Burke, who adopted a dog named Pretty Boy Floyd from his former route after the dog's elderly owner passed away, ensuring the animal wouldn't stay in a shelter. Both stories emphasize persistence and the positive impact of community connections.</p>

          <p>A violent incident in Lexington, Kentucky, resulted in the deaths of two women and the gunman at a local church. The suspect, identified as Guy House, had earlier shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop before carjacking a vehicle and fleeing to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. The two victims, a mother and daughter, were reportedly targeted when the gunman arrived looking for another family member. Two other men were also wounded in the attack before police shot and killed the suspect at the scene.</p>

          <p>An article examines the pros and cons of utility-sponsored power saver programs, which offer financial incentives for allowing companies to remotely control home air conditioning during peak demand. While these programs can lower bills and reduce grid strain, they also present risks, including loss of control during heatwaves, potential equipment wear, and data privacy concerns. Incidents where thousands of users were locked out of their thermostats highlight the need for consumers to read the fine print carefully. The article suggests securing smart devices and understanding opt-out procedures before enrolling in such a program.</p>

After allies promised its release, Trump dismissed the issue and later claimed the files were Democratic disinformation, a move that contradicted his previous stance. The author suggests this particular reversal has sparked a revolt because the Epstein saga holds a central, visceral place in the MAGA worldview, unlike more abstract policy promises.

While payouts do increase with age because of shorter life expectancy calculations, the article argues this rule is an oversimplification. Waiting until 75 may mean forgoing years of needed income, drawing down other assets, and risking changes in health that could limit options. The best time to buy an annuity depends on individual circumstances, including retirement goals, other income sources, and risk tolerance, rather than an arbitrary age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial expert Suze Orman identifies critical accounts for building a strong retirement plan, including the 401(k) and the Roth 401(k). She emphasizes maximizing employer matching contributions in a traditional 401(k), as many people fail to contribute enough to receive the full match, effectively leaving free money on the table. Orman also strongly advocates for using a Roth 401(k) if available, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for completely tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This strategy provides significant long-term tax advantages for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the IDF, Quneita was involved in the October 7th attack and held British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari captive in his home. Damari was held for 471 days before being released in a ceasefire deal in January; during her captivity, she was shot, denied adequate food, and had to hide her sexuality.

          <p>The Trump administration has fired another 15 immigration judges, adding to the dozens let go in the past six months as part of an effort to accelerate deportations. The judges, who were at the end of their two-year probationary period, were terminated without a stated reason. The union representing the judges called the move "outrageous," noting it contradicts congressional efforts to hire more judges to clear a backlog of nearly 4 million cases. The firings have raised concerns that judges are being removed based on their perceived loyalty rather than performance.</p>

Though these products are smoke-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to children. Researchers analyzed U.S. poison center data and found that while pouch ingestions are a small fraction of all nicotine exposures, they are more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. Health experts are calling for a ban on flavored nicotine products, which are often sold in colorful packaging attractive to children.</p>

          <p>An article analyzes the rare political defeat of the powerful health care lobby, which failed to stop Congress from passing deep cuts to Medicaid to fund President Trump's recent tax and spending bill.

Other factors included a lingering GOP frustration with the industry's support for the Affordable Care Act. While the lobby secured some concessions, it was ultimately unable to prevent over $1 trillion in cuts over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Economist questions whether the long-held advantage of cheap housing in red states is coming to an end. For years, a primary driver of migration from blue states like California to red states like Florida and Texas has been the significant difference in housing costs. However, as these red states experience population booms, their housing markets are facing increased pressure, potentially eroding the affordability that made them so attractive. This shift could have significant economic and political consequences for domestic migration patterns in the United States.</p>
