          <p>Millions of travelers across the UK are bracing for significant disruption this bank holiday weekend, marked by extensive rail strikes, engineering works, and anticipated heavy road traffic. The RMT union's industrial action on CrossCountry routes will halt services on Saturday and limit them on Monday, while the RAC forecasts 17.6 million car journeys, with particular congestion expected on the M5. Despite the travel challenges, the weather is predicted to be mostly dry, encouraging large crowds at numerous festivals and events nationwide, making this the last long weekend before Christmas for many regions.</p>

Couples like Ellie and Brad emphasize the joy their dog Newton brought to their special day, reflecting a broader trend where nearly nine in ten people consider their dog their best friend and emotional support. Chaperone services like Precious Pets Weddings and Paws2Party are emerging to help integrate pets seamlessly, handling everything from pre-wedding consultations to on-the-day grooming and supervision.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe is experiencing a prolonged and intense summer heatwave, with temperatures reaching extreme highs across the continent, including Madrid and Paris. This unprecedented heat has exposed Europe's unpreparedness for such conditions, leading to a massive surge in demand for air conditioning units. Consequently, Chinese manufacturers, who dominate approximately 80% of the global AC market, have seen their exports to Europe jump by nearly 60% in July compared to the previous year. The trend underscores the economic impact of global warming and China's significant role in meeting the continent's urgent cooling needs.</p>

          <p>OnlyFans, the subscription-based content platform, reported a robust financial year in 2024, with revenues reaching $1.4 billion, a 9% increase, and pre-tax profits rising to $683.6 million. The platform's owner, Ukrainian-American entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky, received a substantial $701 million in dividends, adding to over $1 billion he has accumulated from the business. This financial success comes as the company, known for its adult content, is reportedly preparing for a potential sale that could value it at $8 billion. The growth is attributed to a significant increase in both creator and fan accounts, highlighting the platform's expanding user base and profitability.</p>

          <p>A devastating explosion at an illegal fireworks warehouse in Karachi, Pakistan, resulted in the deaths of at least four people and injured over 30 others. The blast caused a large fire, engulfing the warehouse and several nearby shops, and damaging vehicles in the Jinnah Road area. Authorities have arrested two warehouse owners, stating that raw materials for fireworks and potentially bombs were illegally stored in the basement. This incident, similar to a prior blast in Punjab province, highlights ongoing infrastructure and safety challenges in Pakistan's densely populated financial capital.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has significantly lowered the tariffs threatened on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union, capping them at 15% instead of the previously indicated 250% and 100% respectively. This reduction is part of a broader US-EU trade agreement, though the 15% tariff on European car exports remains conditional on the EU reducing its own industrial duties to zero. The deal, which offers predictability for businesses, has been welcomed by countries like Ireland, a major pharmaceutical exporter. Despite progress, some sectors like wine and spirits remain subject to tariffs, indicating ongoing negotiation challenges in the complex trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate in July cooled to 3.1%, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest since March, yet still higher than economists' 3% forecast.

Despite the slight decline, the 3.1% headline inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month, prompting some analysts to suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates.

          <h2>Kansas Reports Five Serious West Nile Virus Cases Amid Peak Mosquito Season</h2>

          <p>Kansas health officials are monitoring six West Nile virus cases, with five classified as neuroinvasive, indicating severe symptoms like high fever, brain inflammation, and paralysis. While current numbers are below last year's 64 infections and four deaths, health officials warn that risk will rise as mosquito activity peaks in late summer. The CDC reports around 2,000 annual US diagnoses, though under-reporting is common due to mild symptoms. There is no specific treatment for West Nile, but most infected individuals are believed to develop lifelong immunity.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez was denied parole after a nearly 10-hour hearing, decades after he and his brother Lyle murdered their parents in 1989. The parole panel cited Menendez's "behavior in prison," including multiple policy violations since 2013, as the primary reason for denial, despite family support for his release. Menendez will have to wait three years for his next hearing. The Los Angeles County District Attorney continues to oppose his release, asserting the brothers' self-defense claims of abuse are false. The commissioner expressed empathy for abuse victims but noted that victims typically do not kill their abusers.</p>
