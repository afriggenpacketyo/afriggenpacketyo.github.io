          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes summit in Alaska, the U.S. military positioned two B-2 stealth bombers at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. As President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met, one of the B-2s, accompanied by four F-35 fighter jets, performed a flyover. This demonstration of military might, featuring aircraft known for their nuclear capabilities and use in recent operations, was interpreted by some as a strategic show of force. The Pentagon did not officially comment on whether the display was personally ordered by the president to set a tone for the discussions with the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club paid a heartfelt tribute to former player Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, who tragically died in a car crash in July. During the team's Premier League season opener at Anfield, fans created a mosaic and observed a period of silence in their honor. The players wore shirts with a "Forever 20" emblem, retiring Jota's number 20 jersey for the season in consultation with his family. The gestures reflect the deep sense of loss within the club and the broader football community, with similar tributes planned at other matches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Deloitte reveals that the average cost of a packed school lunch has risen nearly 3% from last year, reaching $6.15, due to broader food inflation. While prices for staples like milk and bananas have increased, some items such as white bread and tomatoes have become cheaper. The financial pressure is significant for many American families, prompting them to switch to store brands and seek cheaper options. Cafeteria lunch prices are also up, though federal programs and school-offered free lunches may help mitigate the impact for some students. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell by approximately 14% following the release of weak forward-looking guidance. The company attributed the downturn to increasing uncertainty and lower visibility, primarily due to reduced demand from its clients in China. Despite exceeding third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, the forecast for future performance fell short of analyst expectations. This has led to concerns about company-specific headwinds and the broader impact of macroeconomic and trade issues on the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling hundreds of flights as it prepares for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, set to begin Saturday if a deal is not reached. The airline initiated a gradual shutdown of operations, which is expected to affect over 100,000 customers and could ground its entire fleet. The labor dispute centers on contract negotiations, with the union citing "poverty wages" and unpaid labor as key issues. The airline stated it had offered a significant pay increase but has reached an impasse with the union, creating widespread travel disruption.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a company backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck with a focus on affordability and customization. The strategy involves selling a simple, barebones base model and allowing owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. The company's initial sub-$20,000 price point was heavily reliant on federal tax credits that are now being rolled back. This raises questions about whether the truck can remain competitive at a higher price against established models like the Ford Maverick. (not investment advice)</p>

The report also highlights that some of the biggest average tax cuts will be in wealthy resort counties such as Teton County, Wyoming. Conversely, taxpayers in states like Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest average cuts. A separate Congressional Budget Office report suggests the bill will benefit top earners while potentially reducing resources for lower-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Ruling Paves Way for Trump Administration to Resume Mass Firings at Consumer Watchdog Agency</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's injunction, potentially allowing the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to fire 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The split decision ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction to block the layoffs. This legal battle is part of a broader effort by the administration to reshape the consumer watchdog agency, which has returned over $21 billion to consumers since its creation. The ruling will not take immediate effect, allowing for a potential review by the full court.</p>

          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season less predictable and profitable than in the past, forcing them to adjust schedules more surgically. Travel demand is shifting, with some passengers flying earlier in the summer and others pushing European trips to the fall to avoid heat and crowds. In response to these changing patterns and higher labor costs, carriers have been cutting capacity in August. This unpredictability, coupled with last-minute bookings, has led major airlines to lower their full-year profit forecasts despite recent improvements in demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force finds his claims about crime levels to be misleading. While D.C. did experience a crime spike in 2023, making its homicide rate high compared to states, recent data from the city's police shows a significant decrease in violent crime in 2024 and 2025. The article notes that comparing a city to entire states is an inapt comparison. The downward trend in D.C. crime aligns with a broader national decrease in violent crime reported by the FBI.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of the U.S. government taking an ownership stake in the struggling semiconductor company Intel, according to a Bloomberg report. This potential intervention, which caused Intel's stock to rise, is being framed by some analysts as a necessary step for national security to ensure domestic chip manufacturing capabilities. The move would aim to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung. Discussions have reportedly included using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure a potential government investment in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

The move comes as shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest level since recording began in 2002.
