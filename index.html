          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have promised President Trump huge investments into the US, but falling oil prices present a significant challenge to their ability to fulfill these pledges. Lower oil prices impact the national income of these oil-dependent nations, affecting their capacity to finance large-scale investments. Experts suggest that Saudi Arabia may face pressure on spending, while the UAE and Qatar are in a better position due to current account surpluses. The article also raises concerns about whether these promises can be met, considering past instances where similar pledges did not materialize.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing growing concern about increasing societal polarization and the question of how to address the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

There is debate over whether to ban the AfD, with concerns about further social division versus the need to protect democracy.

          <p>The ceasefire between India and Pakistan, reached after U.S.-led mediation, was shaken by overnight fighting in disputed Kashmir. Both sides accused each other of violating the deal, with India reporting strikes into Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan. The escalation followed a gun massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan. The two countries agreed to stop all military action on land, in the air, and at sea as part of the ceasefire, but reports of heavy exchanges of fire persisted.</p>

Some Indian supporters cast the truce as a result of the might of the Indian armed forces, while Pakistanis also viewed it as a victory for their country and military, but uncertainty lingers over whether the cease-fire will hold.</p>

The discussions, the first since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on China, were described as engendering a "total reset" in the relationship. While details were limited, Trump praised the talks as "very good" and noted a friendly and constructive atmosphere, with the goal of opening up China to American business. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>
