          <h2>Number of Missing in Devastating Texas Floods Drops to Three</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 21:22:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Officials in Texas announced the number of individuals missing after catastrophic holiday weekend floods has sharply decreased from over 100 to just three, following intensive verification efforts by state and local agencies. This significant development comes as recovery operations continue along the Guadalupe River watershed, where the historic flooding claimed at least 135 lives, devastating communities in the Hill Country. In response to the tragedy, state lawmakers are now considering measures to improve inadequate early warning systems for the flash-flood-prone region. The disaster has prompted a review of emergency response and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to nearby lightning strikes, forcing players off the field and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, Steve Borthwick's side scored six tries, completing their tour of Argentina and the United States with a perfect three-win record. The match also served as an opportunity for several players to make their England debuts.</p>

          <p>A New York City pawn shop owner, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy, has pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiring to receive stolen property that was transported across state lines.

The burglary at Burrow's home was part of a string of thefts targeting wealthy individuals, allegedly carried out by organized burglary crews. Nezhinskiy faces up to five years in prison and must pay over $2.5 million in both restitution and forfeiture.</p>

          <p>Following last year's deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law targeting individuals preparing for mass casualty events without a clear ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. Currently, proving a link to a specific ideology is required for such charges. The change would empower authorities to act against violence-obsessed individuals who research targets or plan attacks, regardless of their motivation.</p>

Betts, a perennial All-Star, is experiencing a career-worst offensive season, with his batting average dipping to .241. Roberts decided to take the decision out of the player's hands to allow him to reset mentally by watching a game from the dugout. The move signals the urgency of the situation for the Dodgers, who are relying on their superstar to return to form for their second-half push.</p>

Ukrainian children are taught a distorted version of history that justifies the invasion and are forced to participate in pro-Russian events.

          <p>Police in Nassau County, New York, are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who was fatally injured after being pulled into an MRI machine. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing a medical episode that led to his death the following day. The incident highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn magnetic objects into dangerous projectiles.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who played for the Clippers for six seasons and ushered in the "Lob City" era, would add depth to the team's backcourt alongside James Harden and newly signed Bradley Beal. At 40 years old, Paul played in all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs last season. The move would align with the team's strategy to enhance its ball-handling and playmaking capabilities.</p>

          <p>After years of rapid growth, interest in learning Mandarin Chinese is reportedly waning in several Western nations, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. University enrollment in Mandarin courses in the U.S. has dropped by 25% from its 2013 peak, with similar declines seen in British universities and New Zealand secondary schools. This shift suggests a potential change in perception regarding the language's future importance. While data is limited, the available figures indicate a notable reversal from when Mandarin was widely hailed as a crucial language for the future.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate a key alliance between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate flights from Mexico City's main airport. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy argued that Mexico's policies violate a bilateral aviation agreement and unfairly benefit domestic carriers. All Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules, escalating a trade dispute between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>
