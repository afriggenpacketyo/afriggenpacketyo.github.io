          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein in his sexual assault case, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Giuffre's family stated that she had been a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and her attorney remembered her as a dear friend and champion for other victims. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Britain's Prince Andrew and others, claims which Andrew has denied, though an out-of-court settlement was reached in 2022. Giuffre formed a nonprofit to educate and advocate for sex trafficking victims.</p>

          <p>A large explosion and subsequent fire struck the Shahid Rajaee port in southern Iran, resulting in multiple fatalities and hundreds of injuries. The blast reportedly occurred near a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel, a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, which had arrived from China in March. While Iranian authorities have not confirmed the cause, the incident took place amidst ongoing negotiations between Iran and the United States regarding Tehran's nuclear program. The port has been targeted before, including a cyberattack in 2020 attributed to Israel.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is investigating the possible wrongful deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras, along with her mother and sister, after they were detained during a routine check-in with ICE in New Orleans. The judge expressed strong suspicion that the government deported the child without due process, especially since ICE was informed of the girl's citizenship and provided with her birth certificate. The Department of Homeland Security stated the parent made the decision to take the child to Honduras. A hearing is scheduled for May 16 to further investigate the matter.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old woman was seriously injured and left unable to walk after being trampled at the annual Hallaton bottle kicking event in Leicestershire, where players wrestle wooden kegs through a field. The woman was a spectator on the outskirts of the players when she was kicked in the head and trampled on, suffering a neurological injury and a bleed on her spine. Event organizers said people were warned about the risks of entering the field of play, and that they paid for paramedics to attend, as injuries are common at the event.</p>

The judge accused the government of declaring them gang members without providing any meaningful evidence, while their attorneys emphasized the drastic consequences of the 'alien enemy' designation.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers across the UK are experiencing significant difficulties in booking driving tests due to an ongoing backlog, with some comparing the process to buying festival tickets. The average waiting time is 22 weeks, and the government aims to reduce it to seven weeks by summer 2026. Some learners are paying for apps to alert them to available slots, while others are booking tests far in advance, leading to refresher lessons. The DVSA blames increased demand and changing booking behavior for the backlog, and says it will improve the booking system to block bots.</p>

          <p>The BBC revisited five Donald Trump voters to gauge their reactions to the first 100 days of his second term, revealing a mix of satisfaction and apprehension. While some praised his swift action on immigration and tariffs, others expressed concerns about the economic impact and potential for market instability. One voter expressed nervousness about Trump's approach, saying that if it doesn't work, he'll say it was a mistake and that Trump did things too fast and scared the markets, while another praised Trump for "kicking butt" and restoring a "merit-based society".</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by volatile trade policies, including tariff increases on various countries, leading to global market instability. After initially increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump expanded these measures to other US trading partners before temporarily reversing course for most countries except China. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China have created uncertainty and undermined confidence in the US's ability to manage the global economy. The outcome of these trade policies will likely shape the narrative of Trump's first 100 days and provide insights into his future direction.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Miami and Florida law enforcement agencies arrested nearly 800 illegal immigrants during Operation Tidal Wave. Among those arrested were a convicted Colombian murderer, alleged MS-13 and 18th Street gang members, and a Russian with an Interpol Red Notice for manslaughter. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) provided "extraordinary support" during the operation, which they claim was highly successful, as the operation enhanced President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>Russia's military stated it has regained full control of the Kursk region from Ukrainian troops, a claim denied by Ukraine. Top Russian commander Valery Gerasimov praised the "heroism" of North Korean troops during a Russian counter-offensive, marking the first public acknowledgment of their involvement. Ukrainian forces have been in retreat in Kursk in recent months, facing 70,000 Russian troops and heavy drone attacks. Ukraine says its troops are still conducting operations in the Russian border region, describing Moscow's claims as "propaganda tricks".</p>

          <p>A miniature dachshund named Valerie was rescued on Kangaroo Island after surviving 529 days in the Australian wilderness. Valerie disappeared during a camping trip and survived intense heat, avoided venomous snakes, and evaded rescue efforts. Kangala Wildlife Rescue worked for over 1,000 hours to find the dog, ultimately capturing her using a trap cage with the owner's clothing and toys. Valerie's rescue provides hope for those who have lost pets.</p>
