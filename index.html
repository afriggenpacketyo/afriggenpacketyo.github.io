          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, former President Joe Biden's physician, has declined to testify before a Republican-led House committee investigating Biden's cognitive health. Citing physician-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, O'Connor refused to answer questions in a scheduled deposition. The committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer, is probing what it calls a "cover-up of President Joe Biden's cognitive decline," a claim the Biden administration has consistently denied. Comer criticized the decision, vowing to continue the investigation by interviewing other former White House aides to seek transparency for the American public.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a potential 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, citing the ongoing criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as an "international disgrace." This represents one of the steepest tariffs threatened against any U.S. trading partner and comes as part of a broader tariff push against multiple nations. Trump's letter also criticized Brazil for alleged unfair trade practices and attacks on the free speech rights of Americans, referencing scrutiny of the social media platform X. The move has sparked concerns about rising consumer prices, especially since the U.S. currently runs a trade surplus with Brazil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister, has announced his defection to the rival Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage. In a statement, Berry criticized both the Conservative and Labour parties, stating that "Britain is broken" and that the old political system has failed. He is the fourth former Conservative MP to switch to Reform in the past two weeks, signaling growing momentum for Farage's party. A Conservative spokesperson dismissed Reform as a "high spend, high tax party," while Labour suggested Farage is adopting the "reckless economics" of the Liz Truss era.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with five African leaders, President Donald Trump complimented Liberian President Joseph Boakai on his "beautiful English," asking where he was educated. President Boakai appeared to chuckle before confirming he was educated in Liberia, where English is the official language. The West African nation was founded in the 19th century as a colony for free Black Americans. The exchange occurred as Trump promoted a shift in U.S. policy toward Africa from "aid to trade," encouraging investment while the visiting leaders praised his international peace efforts and expressed support for a Nobel Prize nomination.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent vacillation on weapons shipments to Ukraine is creating significant logistical and strategic challenges for Kyiv's war effort. After suspending a promised arms delivery, President Trump reversed course and announced the aid would be sent, but the inconsistency undermines Ukraine's ability to plan long-term military operations. According to military planners, this uncertainty is more damaging than the temporary lack of a single shipment, as it forces constant adjustments to battlefield strategy. The unpredictable policy mirrors President Trump's transactional approach and could be interpreted by Russia as a sign of waning U.S. support.</p>

While third parties have historically struggled to gain traction, the analysis posits that Musk's party could potentially harm Republicans more than Democrats by siphoning off swing voters or the "crackpot vote" from the MAGA base.

          <p>A recent dip in the price of gold has some investors considering it a buying opportunity, as the precious metal has fallen about 4% from its recent highs. This article suggests the decline is likely to be temporary, given gold's long-term upward trajectory and the potential for market-moving events like new inflation reports. It argues that waiting could risk being priced out permanently if gold surges toward a potential $4,000 per ounce valuation. The piece also highlights gold's traditional role as a hedge against inflation and a tool for portfolio diversification, benefits that remain valuable regardless of short-term price fluctuations.

          <p>Tim Leiweke, the CEO of venue management giant Oak View Group (OVG), has been indicted on a federal criminal conspiracy charge for allegedly rigging the bid for the University of Texas's Moody Center arena.

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the policy is not only "deeply unfair" but also illegal. This legal action is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to restrict transgender rights and follows a directive to strip federal funding from schools with inclusive policies.

Although the stock closed slightly lower, leaving the company's valuation just under the milestone, it still stands as the world's most valuable company.

These controversial PIP changes were scrapped for existing claimants and delayed for new ones following the objections.

To qualify for the full credit, parents must have an annual income of $200,000 or less for single filers, or $400,000 for joint filers. While the credit amount is larger, eligibility rules were not expanded, meaning the increase will primarily benefit middle- and high-income families, as millions of children in low-income households still do not qualify for the full benefit.

The change, which could create up to 36,000 new higher-leverage mortgages annually, was welcomed by major lender Nationwide.

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, Chapter 7 bankruptcy can offer a financial fresh start, but it's a decision with significant consequences. This article outlines three crucial things to know before filing. First, while it can discharge debts like credit cards and medical bills, it does not eliminate student loans, recent tax debts, or alimony. Second, filers face short-term tradeoffs, such as the potential liquidation of nonexempt assets, and a long-term impact on their credit report for up to 10 years. Finally, it is important to consider alternatives like debt management plans or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which may be better suited to one's financial situation.</p>
