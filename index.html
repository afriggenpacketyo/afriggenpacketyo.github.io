        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Larne Leisure Centre was attacked amidst a third night of violence in Northern Ireland, sparked by a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena. Masked young people threw objects at vehicles, causing damage to the leisure center's front reception and extensive smoke damage. Emergency services responded, and families who had sought shelter at the center were safely relocated. In Ballymena, police faced a crowd throwing smoke bombs, fireworks, bottles, and bricks, leading to the deployment of dogs and water cannons, with some homes displaying stickers outlining residents' nationalities in response to the unrest. The police are reviewing footage of the incidents and have requested additional support from Police Scotland, noting that the violence is undermining the criminal investigation and causing distress to a young victim and her family. Optimism about the situation remains relatively low given the ongoing unrest and potential for further escalation.</p>

          <h2>Egg Prices Drop to Five-Month Low Due to Avian Flu Abatement and Seasonal Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 18:05:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are seeing relief as egg prices fell to $4.55 per dozen in May, an 11% decrease from April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This drop is attributed to the receding effects of the widespread avian flu outbreak and a seasonal softening in egg demand as consumers shift to more meat and outdoor grilling during the summer months. While prices have decreased for two consecutive months, they remain higher than the previous year, with experts cautioning that the avian flu outbreak is not entirely contained and continues to impact the industry, as evidenced by a May outbreak at an Arizona layer farm affecting nearly 1.4 million birds. Consumer Price Index data shows that overall food costs rose slightly in May, but egg prices dropped, though they are still substantially higher than they were 12 months ago. The recent price drop provides some relief for consumers, but the industry remains vigilant about the ongoing threat of avian flu.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to reject most of the Department of Homeland Security's request for 20,000 troops to arrest migrants, raising concerns about potential violations of federal law. Hegseth's appearance before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee follows a trip to Fort Bragg with President Trump, where Trump vowed to use military force to suppress what he called "anarchy" and told soldiers he would "liberate" Los Angeles. This decision highlights ongoing tensions between the administration's immigration policies and the legal constraints on military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The situation underscores the administration's approach to immigration enforcement and the legal and ethical considerations surrounding the use of military personnel in such operations.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his retrial, while the jury found him not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding accuser Kaja Sokola. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of third-degree sexual assault involving Jessica Mann and was sent home to continue deliberations. The jury foreperson reported an alleged threat from a fellow juror, leading to defense attorneys requesting a mistrial, which was denied. The split verdict was considered a partial victory for Weinstein by his publicist, while Sokola's lawyer emphasized that her testimony helped bring down a man who believed he was untouchable, marking a victory for survivors everywhere. Haley expressed hope that the verdict would empower others to speak out and seek justice.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department asserted that President Trump has the authority to federalize the National Guard in California, dismissing Governor Newsom's lawsuit as a "crass political stunt" that risks endangering lives. The administration argues that Trump has no obligation to consult or notify Newsom before federalizing the National Guard under 10 U.S.C. Â§ 12406, which allows deployment in the event of "rebellion or danger of a rebellion." Newsom's lawyers contend that the immigration protests do not constitute a rebellion, while 26 Republican attorneys general filed an amicus brief supporting Trump's decision. The judge declined to block Trump's actions temporarily but ordered both parties to appear in court to consider broader injunctive relief.</p>

While many support deporting criminals, there is discomfort with deporting hardworking individuals without criminal records. Abel Delgado, head of Miami-Dade County's Democratic Hispanic Caucus, noted the shock of deporting people to authoritarian regimes like Cuba and Venezuela. Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar has expressed similar concerns and plans to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to discuss the issue. The concerns highlight the complex views on immigration within the Cuban-American community and the potential impact on Trump's support in Florida.</p>

Universities depend on tuition fees from international students and see Chinese students as integral to their academic operations.
