          <p>Japan has announced a package of emergency economic measures to mitigate the adverse effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, signaling concerns about the potential impact on the country's exports and broader economy. The relief package focuses on corporate financing and stimulating consumption in order to alleviate the pressure from U.S. levies. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief representative in tariff negotiations, is scheduled to visit Washington for a second round of talks to seek common ground amidst rising trade tensions. The measures aim to stabilize Japan's economy amid the uncertainty of the U.S. trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Business Advocate Claims US Overestimates Leverage in China Tariff Negotiations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, suggests the U.S. may be overestimating its leverage in tariff negotiations with China, noting that Beijing has been preparing for this scenario since mid-2018. Stein points out that China doesn't feel the urgency for a deal that the White House might assume, and that China perceives the U.S. tariff policy as part of a broader strategy to contain its growth. According to Stein, the escalation of tariffs stemmed from Washington's expectation that Beijing would initiate contact after the initial tariffs were imposed, which China did not do, and China does not want to be 'bullied on the world stage'. The comments come amid reports that President Trump is considering reducing tariffs on China, while China denies any progress in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>China's leadership has pledged to stabilize the economy and society in response to the ongoing trade war with the United States, emphasizing a focus on domestic support. The Politburo, led by President Xi Jinping, announced plans to support companies and individuals affected by the trade war, aiming to stabilize employment, businesses, and markets. To boost domestic consumption, Beijing intends to increase the income of lower and middle-income groups and develop service consumption, removing restrictive measures in the consumption sector.

          <p>Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was not selected in the first round of the NFL draft, despite earlier projections suggesting he might be a top pick. Cam Ward from Miami was chosen first overall by the Tennessee Titans, and Travis Hunter, another Colorado player, was selected second by the Jacksonville Jaguars. Sanders' draft stock declined recently, leading to his slide out of the first round, while the draft focused heavily on defensive and offensive linemen. Sanders will now await the second and third rounds on Friday, with a possibility that Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe might be chosen before him.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's hardline immigration policies are under scrutiny, with reports of arrests, deportations, and visa revocations sparking widespread fear. Cases include a Salvadoran man wrongly deported based on flimsy evidence, a Turkish student detained for criticizing Israel, and a U.S. citizen wrongfully held for illegally entering the country. Critics argue that the administration's tactics are cruel and arbitrary, creating a climate of fear among immigrant communities. The administration defends its actions as necessary for national security, but faces accusations of ignoring due process and obstructing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Myanmar authorities have arrested an astrologer for causing public panic by predicting a new earthquake in a viral TikTok video. John Moe The had warned that an earthquake would "hit every city in Myanmar" on 21 April, just two weeks after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake killed 3,500 people and destroyed centuries-old temples in the South East Asian nation. The information ministry said he was arrested Tuesday for making "false statements with the intention of causing public panic". Experts say earthquakes are impossible to predict due to the complexity of the factors involved in such disasters.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Caral, Peru, have unearthed the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman, suggesting women held important roles in the ancient Caral civilization. The remains were carefully preserved in layers of fabric and included a mantle of macaw feathers, skin, nails, and hair. Preliminary findings indicate the woman was between 20-35 years old and about 5 feet tall. The discovery challenges the notion that rulers were predominantly men, highlighting the significance of women in this ancient South American society.</p>

Shanghai will offer subsidies up to 300 million yuan for companies developing core products like rockets and satellites, and cover 10% of manufacturing upgrades, up to 100 million yuan per project.

          <p>A government survey in Japan reveals that 35% of local government officials have faced overbearing or abusive behavior from residents, significantly higher than the rate found in private-sector studies. This suggests that public officials regularly encounter unreasonable requests from taxpayers, given their role as "servants of the whole community" under the Constitution. The government has submitted an amendment bill requiring companies to establish rules against customer abuse and provide complaint systems for victims.

          <h2>Post Office Continues Using Faulty Horizon System Despite Scandal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 00:46:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Post Office has spent over £600 million to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it over a decade ago, due to unfavorable terms in the original 1999 deal with Fujitsu. The Post Office did not own the computer code for the core system, making it difficult and costly to switch suppliers or inspect the software. This reliance on Fujitsu's assurances led to the wrongful prosecution of around 700 sub-postmasters for theft and fraud, based on supposed cash shortfalls reported by the Horizon system. The Post Office is working towards a replacement, but experts believe the contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond its current end date in March 2026.</p>

South Korea is reportedly seeking reciprocal and item-specific tariff exemptions, emphasizing its role as a "reliable partner." A new government will be in place following the June 3 election, which may influence the outcome of negotiations.</p>
