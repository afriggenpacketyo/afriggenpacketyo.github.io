        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's 2026 budget proposal outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the EPA, while increasing defense spending by 13% to $1.01 trillion and allocating $175 billion for the southern border. The proposal has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans like Senators Wicker, Collins, and McConnell expressing concerns about defense spending levels and program cuts, while Democrats like Senator Murray warn of the impact on working Americans. Budget proposals are often seen as a starting point for negotiations with Congress, highlighting the administration's priorities. The budget's future is uncertain due to congressional opposition.</p>

          <p>Netflix stock has been trading at all-time-high levels, marking an unprecedented 11-day winning streak, fueled by a strong first-quarter earnings report that showed 13% revenue growth. Despite market volatility caused by President Trump's trade policies, Netflix shares have surged over 30% since mid-January, remaining largely unaffected by tariffs. Traditional media stocks like Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney have struggled during the same period, while Netflix forecasts full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion. JPMorgan analysts see further upside for the stock, citing Netflix's leadership in global streaming and the upcoming Advertising Upfronts as potential catalysts.</p>

DuPont is preparing to separate into two publicly traded companies, with the electronics business becoming Qnity on November 1st, an event expected to unlock value for shareholders.

Common symptoms include itchy eyes, sneezing, and nasal congestion, but without fever or body aches. To manage allergies, doctors recommend limiting exposure by keeping windows closed, showering at night, and using over-the-counter antihistamines or nasal sprays. If symptoms persist or interfere with daily life, seeking professional medical advice for prescription options or immunotherapy is advised.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before pursuing debt forgiveness, it's important to assess qualifications, explore alternative debt relief options, and determine if expert help is needed. Debt forgiveness typically requires significant financial hardship and is best suited for unsecured debts like credit cards. Alternatives include debt management plans, debt consolidation, or bankruptcy, depending on individual circumstances. Engaging a debt relief company can aid in negotiations but comes with fees, so borrowers must weigh the potential savings against the cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April, adding 177,000 jobs with an unemployment rate of 4.2%, despite the onset of President Trump's trade war, according to the Labor Department. While this data is backward-looking, it reassured investors worried about a potential trade-induced economic slowdown. However, analysts caution that the full impact of tariffs on the labor market will be felt in the coming months, with some companies already pulling forecasts for the year.

          <p>A federal judge partially blocked President Trumpâ€™s executive order on election integrity, halting a new proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal voter registration forms and a provision directing election officials to verify citizenship. The judge upheld provisions requiring states not to count mail-in ballots received after Election Day. The ruling underscores the ongoing debate over election integrity, with the judge asserting that Congress and individual states, not the executive branch, have the authority to regulate federal elections.</p>

          <p>A popular Reddit community was outraged to discover that researchers had infiltrated their subreddit, posting AI-written comments and passing them off as human thoughts. The researchers, based at the University of Zurich, wanted to determine if AI-generated responses could change people's views. They posted over 1,000 AI-generated comments on various topics, and the AI commenters even shared backstories, claiming to be trauma counselors or victims of statutory sexual assault. The experiment has been widely condemned as unethical, and the university is investigating.</p>

With rising tariff rates, ports on the U.S. West Coast have reported a slowdown, raising concerns about supply shortages.
