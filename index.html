          <p>Treasury minister Darren Jones announced that the era of globalization has ended due to President Trump's new tariffs, impacting nations like the UK with a 10% import duty. Prime Minister Starmer is expected to announce state intervention to protect UK firms. Jones emphasized the need to invest in the UK's economy and build relationships with allies, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch disagreed, citing strong trading relationships with other countries. The Liberal Democrats are calling for a parliamentary vote on any trade deal with Trump, particularly regarding farming and online content regulations.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged over 2,200 points and the Nasdaq entered bear market territory due to concerns about the economic impact of new U.S. tariffs. President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs has led economists to revise their forecasts for U.S. economic growth downward, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warning of higher inflation and slower growth. Analysts suggest that the U.S. could face a recession later this year if tariffs are not eased, and China's retaliatory tariffs further exacerbate the situation. The market free-fall has erased trillions of dollars in investor wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg of *The Atlantic* to a Signal group chat discussing US strikes in Yemen due to a series of accidental events. The error stemmed from Waltz inadvertently saving Goldberg's number under a different contact after Goldberg emailed the Trump campaign. Trump was reportedly more upset that Waltz had Goldberg's number than the fact that the discussion occurred on an unclassified system. The White House authorized the use of Signal due to the lack of a better alternative for cross-agency communication.</p>

These include noticing and honoring emotions, regulating one's own emotions, avoiding labeling emotions as 'good' or 'bad,' and practicing self-reflection. By modeling healthy emotional coping mechanisms, parents teach their children that emotions are valuable messengers, enabling them to handle conflict and disappointment with confidence and wisdom.

          <p>Americans are bracing for economic uncertainty as President Trump doubles down on tariffs, triggering market turmoil and raising recession fears. Despite criticism from global leaders and his own party, Trump remains resolute, viewing tariffs as a means to revive American manufacturing. While some express concerns about the economic impact, others see potential opportunities for growth. The Federal Reserve has warned that Trump's policies risk higher inflation and slower growth, and the cost of importing goods into the U.S. is already rising. The situation has left Americans grappling with the potential consequences of Trump's trade war.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is increasingly concerned that China's regular large-scale military drills could escalate into a real attack by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The island worries about its ability to respond quickly enough as the PLA continues to erode buffer zones. A former Taiwanese air force commander warned that Chinese warplanes could reach Taipei within three minutes of crossing the median line, leaving little time for response. The PLA has conducted numerous large-scale exercises since 2022, simulating amphibious landings and precision strikes.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist explores the complexities of financial dependence in relationships, particularly when one partner earns significantly more than the other. The columnist challenges the illusion of complete independence, drawing on philosophical and feminist perspectives to argue for the reality of interdependence.

Ultimately, the column emphasizes that accepting interdependence can lead to a deeper and more fulfilling connection.</p>

          <p>An *Atlantic* writer recommends B.J. Novak's film *Vengeance* for its accurate portrayal of the South, noting that many films about the region are often offensive. The reviewer appreciates how Novak spent time in West Texas to better understand its people, capturing both the good and bad aspects of a complex place. The film is praised for its humor and its spot-on depiction of the North-South disconnect, while also paying homage to Southern culture, particularly the honey-butter chicken biscuit. The reviewer also shares her appreciation for musical artist Michael Martin Murphey and other cultural favorites.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Smithsonian Institution, including the National Zoo, to be rid of all “improper ideology,” but the exact nature of the zoo's supposed transgressions remains unclear. The zoo's strategic plan emphasizes the impact of humans on wildlife, and its exhibits feature interpretive panels in both English and Spanish. While some panels address the historical impact of European colonists, the zoo has also acquired pandas from China as a gesture of friendship. The Reptile House, however, remains un-audited for critical race theory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay discusses the growing class divide in America, arguing that a "comfort class" dominates influential sectors like media, academia, and government, often disconnected from the financial struggles of most Americans. The author points to the lack of financial anxiety as a source of stress in wearable devices and the overrepresentation of millionaires in Congress as examples of this disconnect. The article suggests that this classism fuels resentment and contributes to the rejection of certain social and political ideologies, highlighting the need for greater understanding and representation of diverse financial experiences.</p>

          <p>Stanley Plumly's poem 'Chickadee' contrasts the sublime with the small, intimate moments of observing chickadees during winter. The poem recalls memories of Margaret feeding chickadees and the speaker's own observations of the birds filling a feeder outside a kitchen window. It reflects on the contrast between the grand, deep things in nature and the small, resilient chickadees that provide warmth and life in the cold. The poem captures the beauty of these small creatures and the comfort they bring in a season of separation.</p>
