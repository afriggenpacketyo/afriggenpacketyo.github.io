        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's fast bowler Jamie Overton is sidelined for the remaining one-day internationals against the West Indies after fracturing his little finger. The injury occurred while he was attempting to catch the ball during England's recent victory at Edgbaston. Expected to be out for approximately a month, Overton will also miss the subsequent T20 matches against the West Indies. No replacement has been named for the upcoming second ODI in Cardiff, where England aims to secure the series win. The team will need to adjust their strategy in light of Overton's absence. The loss of Overton will require the team to make adjustments to their bowling lineup for the remainder of the series. The team hopes that he will have a speedy recovery.</p>

          <p>Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are increasingly challenging the Trump administration's use of antisemitism allegations to justify repressive policies. They argue that these policies do not represent their Jewish values and are being used to undermine academic freedom and suppress pro-Palestinian voices. These Jewish organizers have been writing letters, leading protests, and lobbying legislators to denounce what they view as the systematic exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel. They emphasize the need for nuanced discussions about Israel, antisemitism, and Jewish identity that respect diverse perspectives and generational differences. Many feel compelled to invoke their Jewish identity publicly for the first time to combat the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Brad G. Smith, diagnosed with ALS, can now communicate using only his thoughts thanks to a Neuralink brain implant. The device, placed in his skull and connected to the motor cortex, picks up signals from his neurons and transmits them wirelessly to a computer, which decodes the signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor and type. Smith previously relied on eye-tracking technology, which was limited by lighting conditions. Smith now uses Grok, an AI chatbot, to assist with writing responses and suggesting replies, enhancing his communication speed and capabilities. Neuralink recently received a "breakthrough" designation from the FDA, with hopes of helping people with severe speech impairments.</p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has sparked debate about whether the U.S. might follow suit. While Denmark's move signals a desire for people to work longer, experts caution that the U.S. may face challenges due to income inequality and varying life expectancies. Raising the retirement age in the U.S. could disproportionately harm lower-income individuals who already receive benefits for a shorter period. Moreover, the phased implementation of such a change would take time, potentially not addressing the immediate funding issues faced by the Social Security Administration. The article explores the economic and social implications of raising the retirement age.</p>

Half of the surveyed homeowners are unwilling to wait more than three years to return, highlighting the need for swift action from government officials. The top concern among displaced homeowners is the lack of leadership to expedite the rebuilding process. The Project Recovery report suggests that the building permit process needs to be streamlined to enable rebuilding within three years. Homeowners also worry about future fire and landslide risks, emphasizing the importance of better knowledge about managing homes in combustible environments.</p>

          <p>Mexico is holding unprecedented elections to choose its judges, a move hailed by supporters as a blow against impunity but denounced by critics as a step toward authoritarianism. Voters will elect over half of the country's federal judges and magistrates, including Supreme Court justices, with candidates selected by lottery. Critics worry that the process lacks qualifications and will favor candidates close to the ruling party, weakening checks and balances. The elections, championed by President Sheinbaum, aim to reform a corrupt and nepotistic system, but opponents fear they will lead to a one-party state. Many Mexicans remain skeptical and unaware of the candidates, raising concerns about the vote's legitimacy.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are criticizing proposed rules to implement a state law aimed at curbing plastic waste, arguing that the draft regulations undermine the law's intent. They claim that CalRecycle, the state's waste agency, exceeded its authority by including provisions that allow polluting recycling technologies and expansive exemptions for products under USDA and FDA purview. The lawmakers argue that these exemptions could increase program costs and allow producers to unilaterally determine which products are subject to the law. The governor's office maintains that the regulations aim to minimize costs for small businesses and families, but critics fear they cater to industry and could lead to higher costs for households and jurisdictions. The law is designed to shift waste removal costs from taxpayers to the industries producing the waste.</p>

          <p>The article examines how governments can suppress free speech without resorting to direct censorship. It highlights three key methods: conditioning benefits on the sacrifice of free speech, intimidating speakers into silence, and molding government speech to promote official ideology. The Trump administration has been accused of using these tactics, such as withholding funding from universities that embrace DEI or have allegedly tolerated antisemitism. Intimidation, through actions like deporting noncitizen students for their speech, can also chill expression. The administration's control over government speech, such as purging disfavored content from museums, further skews public discourse. These actions, while not outright censorship, undermine the principles of free speech by using official power to make speech less free.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings to determine if faulty drug tests led to wrongful parole denials. Nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July of the previous year. Attorneys for the Board of Parole are assessing inmate files to identify cases where a new hearing may be warranted. Representatives at UnCommon Law, a nonprofit advocacy group, indicated that the review involves at least 459 parole hearings and dozens of administrative reviews. The faulty tests were identified by the California Correctional Health Care Services after noticing a spike in positive opiate drug screenings.</p>

          <p>Despite advocating for harsher penalties for drug dealers, President Trump has sparked controversy by pardoning individuals convicted of federal drug charges, including some with violent criminal records. This has led to mixed signals and uncertainty regarding the administration's approach to drug policy. While some critics cautiously praise Trump's use of clemency to free drug offenders, others view the pardons as transactional and influenced by powerful individuals. Experts note the lack of a coherent philosophy behind Trump's clemency decisions, contrasting them with his tough-on-crime rhetoric. The administration maintains that the president is open to seeing if these people are worthy of redemption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations warns that Gaza is the "hungriest place on Earth," with its entire population at risk of famine due to restricted aid and ongoing conflict. The UN criticizes Israel for obstructing aid operations and calls for an end to deliberate starvation tactics. Limited aid is entering Gaza, but the UN says it's having "very, very little impact" due to logistical challenges and restrictions. Palestinians report severe shortages of food, flour, and basic necessities, with some parents resorting to giving their children water to feel full. The UN also criticizes the type of aid allowed in, noting that ready-to-eat meals are prohibited.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks and a Â£2 billion upgrade, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales has fully reopened. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. The project, initially conceived in 1990, involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's economic benefits, opponents criticize its lengthy duration and high cost. The project's completion marks the end of significant roadworks for drivers traveling between Swansea and Monmouthshire.</p>

This change aims to streamline decision-making and speed up the release of product updates, but raises concerns about potential risks to user privacy and safety. Former employees fear that AI may not adequately address complex issues and could lead to unforeseen repercussions. Meta maintains that human expertise will still be used for novel and complex issues, but critics worry that engineers will be empowered to make judgments about risks without sufficient expertise.

Following the changes, India established a decisive advantage before a ceasefire was declared. The conflict was sparked by an attack in Indian Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan-backed terrorists. Chauhan stated that India rectified tactics and then went back on the 7th, 8th and 10th in large numbers to hit air bases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes. Both sides have maintained that there was no danger of nuclear weapons being considered during the conflict.</p>
