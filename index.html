          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick projects the next two weeks will be historic, as the Trump administration aims to finalize trade deals with partners like the EU, Canada, and Mexico. He affirmed that an August 1st deadline for increased tariffs is firm, a tactic designed to compel nations to negotiate new terms with the U.S. Lutnick also dismissed concerns that tariffs would raise consumer prices, instead predicting "shockingly low" prices and benefits for American manufacturers. He further criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's interest rate policies, aligning with President Trump's public attacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from Senator Joni Ernst's office reveals the Biden administration's State Department allocated over $1.2 million for renovating swimming pools at U.S. embassies, including in conflict-affected nations like Iraq, Sudan, and Haiti. The spending included a $41,259 project at the Moscow embassy, initiated three months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Senator Ernst criticized the expenditures as "splashy spending" and a waste of taxpayer money, highlighting it as part of a broader investigation into government inefficiency. The report details various contracts for pool repairs and upgrades across several international posts.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reports that recent immigration raids conducted by the Trump administration have instilled widespread fear throughout the city's large immigrant communities. In an interview, she criticized the tactics of federal agents, describing "masked men in unmarked cars" snatching people, which creates terror even among legal residents and citizens. Bass argues these actions have harmed the local economy and social fabric, with many residents afraid to leave their homes. She also condemned the deployment of federal troops to the city as an unnecessary misuse of taxpayer funds.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett continues to advocate for the public release of Department of Justice files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. While speaking on Sunday, he emphasized the need for transparency but also cautioned against exposing the identities of victims or innocent individuals mentioned in the documents. Burchett pushed back against President Trump's recent characterization of the demands as "foolish," stating he was "a little ticked off" but undeterred. He views the President's subsequent directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal grand jury evidence as a positive first step.</p>

          <p>In a poem titled "Your Horses," published by The Atlantic, poet Jodie Hollander reflects on the work of Ted Hughes. The piece evokes a stark, moody landscape on the moors, where the speaker envisions the powerful, silent, and enduring presence of horses that Hughes once described. The poem contrasts this peaceful, elemental scene with the chaos of public life, questioning whether such tranquility was ever found again. It concludes with a poignant image of a continued, restless search for that profound moment of connection with nature.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls predict his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was marked by public frustration over rising prices and the potential for U.S. tariffs. A loss of the majority would significantly weaken the coalition's legislative power and could destabilize the government during critical trade negotiations. Analysts suggest the result reflects voter dissatisfaction with Ishiba's leadership and a shift of some conservative support to more right-wing parties.</p>

This strategic silence helps manage optics, but it masks a fundamental shift in the labor market. The article notes that while AI can automate many tasks, companies often find human judgment is still essential for final quality control. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, Luis Leon, reports he was secretly detained and deported after visiting an immigration office to replace his lost green card. Leon, who was granted U.S. political asylum in 1987, was taken into custody by ICE officers, and his family was initially unable to locate him, at one point being told he was dead. They later discovered from a relative that he was alive but hospitalized in Guatemala, a country to which he has no known connection. The case highlights concerns over immigration enforcement tactics and due process.</p>

Video of the incident shows a brief struggle as a staff member unsuccessfully tried to take the flag from the performer, who held onto it for the remainder of the applause. The Royal Ballet and Opera called the spontaneous action "completely inappropriate" and not in line with its commitment to political impartiality. The protest drew a mixed reaction from the audience, highlighting the ongoing political tensions surrounding the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and his office have shifted to a notably more aggressive and confrontational social media strategy, directly targeting President Trump and his allies with sharp, often personal, insults. This change in tone, a departure from the traditional Democratic high road, is a deliberate tactic to match the rhetoric coming from the White House and counter what Newsom's office calls attacks on democracy. The strategy has led to a massive increase in social media engagement and followers, positioning Newsom as a prominent national voice willing to directly challenge the administration.</p>

          <p>Russia's major Moscow airports experienced significant disruptions, including temporary closures and over 140 flight cancellations, due to a large-scale Ukrainian drone attack.

The attacks also affected the Kaluga region and areas near the Ukrainian border. This event marks another instance of the war in Ukraine directly impacting civilian infrastructure and daily life deep within Russia, as both sides continue their long-range strikes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. She argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem later in life. Raouda advises parents to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. Fostering this skill builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, serving as a protective buffer for mental health.</p>

Local business owners and residents are banding together to capitalize on the centennial, aiming to transform their "ghost town" atmosphere into a go-to destination for nostalgic travelers.

          <p>Family members of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are voicing increasing frustration and mistrust toward their own government's handling of release negotiations. Campaigners feel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration is not prioritizing the return of their loved ones, pointing to collapsed deals and the influence of far-right coalition partners who they believe value land over human life. Many now place more hope in the U.S. administration to pressure Netanyahu into securing a deal. The sentiment reflects a deep-seated fear that the Israeli ethos of "leaving no one behind" is being abandoned.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her historic career and the challenges of racism and sexism in politics. She recounts a notable incident with Senator Jesse Helms and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in the U.S. Looking at the current political landscape, Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party seems to be "walking around in a daze" in its efforts to counter Donald Trump. Despite recent political setbacks, she remains optimistic about the resilience of American democracy.</p>
