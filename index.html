          <p>Donald Trump is spending the second day of his visit to Scotland on his Turnberry golf course amid a significant police presence. Before scheduled talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, he is playing a round of golf with guests and family. The discussions are set to focus on transatlantic trade relations, with Trump suggesting a 50-50 chance of a deal while also threatening steep tariffs if talks fail. He is also scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney in the coming days to discuss trade and other international issues.</p>

          <p>Health experts are reinforcing the critical importance of using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer, which is on the rise globally. The article addresses public concerns fueled by online myths and legitimate questions about the safety of some chemical ingredients like oxybenzone, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Scientists emphasize that while research into safer, plant-based alternatives is ongoing, the cancer-prevention benefits of current approved sunscreens far outweigh the potential risks. They also advise against homemade sunscreens and caution that mixing different sunscreen products can reduce their effectiveness, urging consumers to prioritize sun protection.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has implemented a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. This move comes amid growing international pressure and severe warnings of famine in the territory, highlighted by recent images of malnourished children. The pause, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, is intended to increase aid flow, though health officials in Gaza warn it must lead to a substantial influx of supplies to save lives. Israel states its broader offensive against Hamas will continue in other areas of Gaza.</p>

          <p>While some prominent right-wing figures have criticized the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, interviews with supporters across the U.S. reveal a more divided response. In areas like Johnstown, Pennsylvania, many voters remain staunchly loyal, dismissing the controversy as a politically motivated distraction and expressing unwavering trust in the president. Other supporters acknowledge disappointment with the administration's rollout of information but prioritize other policy achievements like border security and economic issues. This reveals a split between hardcore MAGA followers highly invested in conspiracy theories and other Republican voters who are more focused on tangible policy outcomes.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that science is not, and has never been, an objective or apolitical field, and that scientists must acknowledge this reality to defend against political attacks and prevent their work from being co-opted for oppressive ends. The authors cite historical examples, such as 19th-century race science, and contemporary biases in evolutionary biology to show how cultural and political values have always shaped scientific inquiry. Rather than striving for an impossible neutrality, the article calls for scientists to embrace political analysis as part of their process.

          <p>China has identified a new, super-large zirconium deposit, a critical mineral for advanced technologies like hypersonic weapons. The deposit, the first of its kind found in a terrestrial basin in China, is estimated to contain two million tonnes of zirconium dioxide. This discovery effectively quintuples the nation's current zirconium reserves. Zirconium alloys are highly valued for their extreme resistance to heat and corrosion, making them essential components in manufacturing key parts of hypersonic vehicles, such as scramjet combustion chambers, nose cones, and thermal protection systems, potentially resolving a key strategic vulnerability for the country.</p>

Some migrants already in the U.S. are choosing to 'self-deport' out of fear of detention. The region's economy is also impacted by tariff uncertainty, while the border itself has seen increased militarization, with new 'national defense' zones patrolled by active-duty troops, fundamentally changing life on both sides of the frontier.</p>

The author argues that both terms serve to dehumanize a targeted group, cloaking cruelty in a seemingly harmless or even humorous nickname to make state-sanctioned violence more palatable. The piece contends that such language is not about public safety, citing studies showing immigrants commit fewer crimes, but is instead a tool to galvanize a political base. It concludes that remembering this history is crucial to recognizing and resisting the normalization of cruelty.</p>

The legacy of paternalistic communist-era social models, followed by economic struggles post-communism, left women's football underfunded and marginalized. Additionally, prevailing cultural norms that discourage girls from playing football and the rise of right-wing politics emphasizing traditional values have created further barriers.

This seeming paradox is attributed to several factors, including a more resilient U.S. economy than anticipated, with a strong labor market and continued consumer spending. Corporate profits have also been better than feared, and there is a growing market belief that the president's ultimate tariff actions will be less severe than his initial threats. However, some analysts remain cautious, noting that stocks are expensive and vulnerable to shocks if major trade deals fail. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States swim team is grappling with an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis that has affected several athletes at the World Aquatics Championships. Team officials confirmed the illness began during a pre-meet training camp in Thailand and has already impacted performances, with notable swimmers like Torri Huske and Claire Weinstein being withdrawn from events. Despite the setback, star swimmer Katie Ledecky appeared unaffected, posting the fastest qualifying time in the women's 400m freestyle. The illness adds a layer of challenge for Team USA as it aims to rebound from a relatively disappointing performance at the last Olympic Games.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of many establishments. Under the reforms, developers building new properties near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new buildings. The plan also aims to fast-track permissions for new businesses in disused shops and for al fresco dining to help reverse the steady decline of the pub industry. The Labour government hopes the changes will remove red tape and bring vibrancy to struggling towns.</p>

The goal is to shift Ghana from an import-based economy to a self-sufficient one, potentially creating 1.7 million new jobs. However, economists raise concerns about the feasibility of the project, pointing to the need for approximately $4 billion in funding, significant infrastructure upgrades like a stable power supply, and a fundamental shift in the national work mindset.</p>

The story culminated in September 2020 when Ashley shot and killed Doug, claiming it was in self-defense during an attack.
