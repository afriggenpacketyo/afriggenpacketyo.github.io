          <p>The head of the International Chamber of Shipping, Guy Platten, stated that shipping companies are resilient and will adapt to trade barriers resulting from the global trade war. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, Platten emphasized the chamber's belief in free trade. The US is set to impose fees on Chinese vessels docking at US ports and on Chinese-built vessels entering US ports starting in October, with these fees escalating over the next few years. These measures aim to re-establish the US shipbuilding industry and enhance national security, according to the US Trade Representative.</p>

          <p>A student at a prestigious national elementary school in Tokyo has left the school due to bullying, marking the second consecutive year the school has reported a "serious" incident to the education ministry. The parents of the student withdrew their child at the end of January after complaints of backbiting and being ignored. The school's Principal Akihiro Sasaki expressed regret for the school's failure to respond adequately, noting that an investigation has not yet started. The number of bullying cases recognized as "serious" has increased significantly in fiscal 2023, reflecting a more proactive stance by schools in recognizing such cases.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the addictive nature of sugar and its detrimental effects on health, tracing the history of sugar consumption and its prevalence in modern diets. While it's debated whether sugar is a substance or behavioral addiction, chronic sugar overconsumption can alter brain pathways, leading to cravings and overconsumption. The article highlights the health risks associated with excessive sugar intake, including diabetes, obesity, and neurological disorders, and suggests strategies for quitting sugar addiction, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and nutritional strategies. It also suggests the role of governments in making healthier food more available.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (P.K.K.) announced it would lay down its arms and end its insurgency against the Turkish state, a move that could have broad regional implications. The decision follows a call from the group's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who stated that the armed struggle had outlived its purpose. The P.K.K. began as a secessionist movement seeking an independent Kurdish state but later shifted to advocating for greater rights for Kurds within Turkey. The group stated that it had brought the Kurdish issue to a point where it could be resolved through democratic politics, calling on Turkey’s Parliament to participate in the disarming process.</p>

Brewing takes place during the winter season, with brewers staying onsite for six months, emphasizing tradition and quality. President Masataka Shirakashi hopes UNESCO heritage listing of traditional sake-brewing techniques will encourage a revival of the beverage among drinkers in Japan. The company also uses traditional wooden equipment and makes its own to ensure the taste of Kenbishi's sake remains unchanged, despite greater financial costs, feeling a responsibility to protect the brand and maintain its taste.</p>

Lula views China as a partner in rebalancing global power, not just an economic partner but a geopolitical counterweight to the US. The meetings are expected to address trade imbalances and protectionist measures, with Latin American countries wary of becoming dumping grounds for Chinese goods. Over the past two decades, China has become a significant purchaser of resources from Latin America and a major investor in the region's infrastructure.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Democrats warn will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office indicates that the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. Republicans argue they are rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, while Democrats claim the cuts amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare.</p>

The blackout, one of Europe's worst, affected millions and disrupted transportation and communication. While Spanish authorities investigate the cause, some observers have suggested that the region's reliance on wind and solar power may have contributed to the outage. However, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the country's grid operator maintain that record levels of renewable energy were not to blame.</p>

The US is under political pressure to show wins, while China views negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience.

Lammy is likely to announce sanctions targeting those backing the Russian invasion, and the leaders aim to demonstrate their united protection of sovereignty, peace, and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Germany and Israel are commemorating the 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, shadowed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is visiting Berlin to mark the occasion, with plans to visit the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The visit occurs during the first days of the new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who is aware of Germany's special responsibility for Israel's security. Despite criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians have repeatedly emphasized Israel's right to defend itself after attacks by Hamas, though the relationship remains complicated.</p>

          <p>Reports that the Trump administration may accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked controversy, raising questions about constitutional rules against bribery and corruption. There is a long history of US presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers, ranging from clothes and antiques to animals, which are typically disposed of through a bureaucratic process. Under US law, gifts valued at less than $480 can be retained by federal employees, while anything over that amount is considered a gift to the "people of the United States." Foreign leaders often use gifts to strengthen relationships and break the diplomatic ice.</p>

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described the talks as resulting in a “deal,” while China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng expressed optimism but stopped short of declaring a done deal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the talks had resulted in “substantial progress,” but Chinese officials indicated that a joint statement on Monday would provide further clarity.

          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the possibility of reintroducing elk to the East Midlands and the UK for the first time in about 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to begin feasibility studies into their return. Elks are considered "keystone" species that can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species. The funding will pay for a disease risk assessment, and the project aims to engage with residents and landowners to gain support. Initially, the elk would be in the same enclosure as beavers, before eventually being released along the Trent valley.</p>
