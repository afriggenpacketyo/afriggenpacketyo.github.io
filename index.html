          <p>During Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebration, employee Ibtihal Aboussad interrupted CEO Mustafa Suleyman's speech, protesting Microsoft's provision of AI technology to the Israeli military.  Aboussad, along with another engineer, Vaniya Agrawal, highlighted concerns about the ethical implications of this technology's use in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the silencing of internal dissent within Microsoft.  Their actions sparked a conversation about the responsibility of AI companies in supplying technology for military applications. This event underscores the growing debate surrounding the ethical use of AI in warfare and the potential for internal conflict within corporations regarding such issues.</p>

          <p>A top US advisor, Mauricio Claver Carone, asserted that continued US support for Argentina's IMF negotiations depends on President Javier Milei ending a currency swap agreement with China.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a temporary stay, allowing the Trump administration to withhold millions in federal education grants.
