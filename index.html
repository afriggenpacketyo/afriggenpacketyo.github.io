          <h2>Tesla's Automotive Revenue and Sales Decline for Second Consecutive Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 16:50:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has reported a significant 16% year-over-year drop in automotive revenue, marking the second straight quarter of declining sales that missed analyst expectations. The company's net income also fell, and its vehicle deliveries saw a 14% slide, partially attributed to public backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Despite the slump, Tesla is moving forward with plans for a more affordable model and continues to focus on future projects like robotaxis. The company's stock has underperformed compared to other major tech firms this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The intense humidity accompanying a major heatwave in the U.S. Midwest is being exacerbated by a phenomenon called "corn sweat," or evapotranspiration, from vast fields of corn. This process, where plants release moisture into the air to cool down, significantly raises the humidity and heat index, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses for vulnerable populations. While a natural process, the scale of monoculture corn farming can intensify these effects compared to native prairies. This agricultural reality contributes to more oppressive heat waves and prevents temperatures from cooling down at night, making extreme heat more dangerous. </p>

          <p>International Business Machines (IBM) saw its shares fall in extended trading despite reporting second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's revenue grew by nearly 8% year-over-year, a significant acceleration from the previous quarter, with strong performance in its software, consulting, and infrastructure segments. IBM reaffirmed its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow, signaling confidence in its business trajectory. The market's negative reaction occurred even as the company continues to benefit from its focus on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York City Jewish leader has voiced significant safety concerns for the city's residents, particularly the Jewish community, should Zohran Mamdani win the mayoral election. Scott Feltman of the One Israel Fund highlighted Mamdani's past associations and his initial reluctance to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada," which is viewed by many as a call for violence. Feltman stated that the community's opposition is not to a candidate's faith but to alignments with what he termed nefarious actors. He also expressed general concern over Mamdani's platform, such as defunding the police, which he believes puts all New Yorkers in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a contentious new law that curtails the powers of the country's key anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO. The legislation grants the prosecutor general, a presidential appointee, significant oversight, including access to all cases and the ability to direct investigations, effectively undermining the agencies' independence. This move has sparked street protests in Kyiv and drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties and EU officials, who warn it is a "serious step back" for Ukraine's European integration. The heads of the affected agencies stated that their autonomy, a prerequisite for fighting high-level corruption, has been destroyed.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility with its variable rate and accessible funds, a CD provides a guaranteed, fixed return but requires locking the money away for a set term. Based on current rates, the 6-month CD would earn slightly more interest, and that return is guaranteed, unlike the savings account rate which is likely to fall. The article concludes that for those who can afford the lack of liquidity, a CD offers a more certain and potentially higher return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort in the U.S. House, led by Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie, to force the release of federal records related to Jeffrey Epstein is gaining momentum despite opposition from leadership.

The resolution calls for releasing evidence identifying individuals involved in Epstein's sex trafficking network while protecting victims' identities. The push has attracted support from across the political spectrum, creating a rare alliance and highlighting a growing demand for government transparency in the case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with the termination of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The unsigned order, which saw the court's three liberal justices dissenting, lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked the firings. Citing a previous ruling, the majority argued that the government faces a greater risk of harm from allowing a removed officer to continue exercising power than the officer faces from being unable to perform their duty. This decision marks another victory for the administration's efforts to assert greater control over independent federal agencies by challenging statutory for-cause removal protections.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler, whose district is considered a key battleground, stated that maintaining the Republican House majority is critical for the economy. The decision follows speculation and a social media post from former President Trump endorsing Lawler for reelection, seen by some as an effort to clear the GOP gubernatorial field for Rep. Elise Stefanik. In his announcement, Lawler immediately pivoted to criticizing potential NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, introducing a bill to probe one of his policy proposals.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant rulings, a federal judge in Tennessee ordered that Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be released from criminal custody while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges. Concurrently, a judge in Maryland barred federal immigration authorities from immediately detaining him upon release, ordering that he be returned to ICE supervision in Maryland where he lives. The Maryland judge's order provides Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, crucial due process protections against being swiftly removed from the U.S. again. His lawyers called the rulings a powerful rebuke of the government's previous actions.</p>

          <p>Climate and Indigenous rights activists held non-violent demonstrations at Wells Fargo offices in New York and San Francisco, leading to seven arrests in San Francisco. The protests mark the start of a campaign against corporations accused of capitulating to the Trump administration's anti-climate agenda. Activists condemn Wells Fargo, a major financier of fossil fuels, for abandoning its climate commitments and investing in companies linked to the Dakota Access pipeline. Protesters blocked entrances and called out the bank for being complicit in environmental destruction, union busting, and what they term the funding of genocide through its investments in certain tech companies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has temporarily halted debt forgiveness for student loan borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. This pause is a direct result of court orders that have blocked the Biden-era SAVE plan, which had altered how qualifying payments were counted, including periods of forbearance. The department stated it needs time to recalculate the correct payment counts for IBR borrowers under the current rules. While monthly payments made under IBR will still count toward future forgiveness, the delay affects those who were expecting imminent debt cancellation under the plan's 20 or 25-year terms.</p>

Critics view the move as a regression toward the corruption of the past and a threat to Ukraine's EU integration prospects. In response to the public anger, Zelenskyy has acknowledged the criticism and pledged to introduce a new bill to address the concerns, though details remain unspecified.</p>
