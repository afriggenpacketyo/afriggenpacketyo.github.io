          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing criticism for his campaign's significant spending on private security services. According to expenditure reports, the campaign paid over $33,000 to a security firm that employs active and retired law enforcement officers. This has drawn scrutiny due to Mamdani's previous public calls to defund and dismantle the New York Police Department, leading to accusations of hypocrisy as he navigates his current campaign platform.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Mexican musician Ricardo Hernández, professionally known as "El Makabelico," for his alleged connections to the Cartel del Noreste (CDN). The administration accuses the narco-rapper of laundering money for the cartel through his music royalties and live performances, with a significant portion of his streaming income allegedly going directly to the criminal organization. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to target the financial networks of Mexican cartels, including those within the controversial "narco-corridos" music genre.</p>

Officials confirmed that a suspect, identified as a male Army sergeant, was taken into custody, ending the active threat to the community.

          <p>The BBC has decided to broadcast a new, pre-filmed season of its popular cooking show "MasterChef," despite having recently fired its long-time hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, over misconduct allegations. The episodes have reportedly been edited to minimize the hosts' banter and jokes, creating a noticeably different tone for regular viewers. The decision to air the series has sparked controversy and backlash, with some critics and former contestants suggesting it should have been shelved out of respect for those whose complaints were upheld.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler, President Trump is weighing several strategic options for filling the influential position. One possibility is appointing a temporary "shadow chair" to serve for the remaining few months of the term, potentially as an audition for becoming the next Fed Chair. Alternatively, he could nominate his preferred long-term successor to Jerome Powell now, a move that would provide more stability but less flexibility. The decision has significant implications for the future direction of the central bank's monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced the cancellation of nearly $500 million in federal contracts for developing mRNA vaccine technology. The administration stated it is moving beyond the limitations of this technology to invest in what it calls better solutions. This decision has been met with alarm from many public health and biosecurity experts, who argue that defunding this proven technology leaves the nation vulnerable to future pandemics and potential bioterrorist threats.</p>

          <p>This article details how homicide detectives in St. Paul, Minnesota, solved the 2022 murder of nurse Alexandra Pennig, which was initially reported as a suicide. The investigation turned when forensics discovered a small, round metal piece from the bathroom door's lock underneath Pennig's body. This crucial finding proved that the door had been forcibly broken open before she was shot, directly contradicting her boyfriend's account and leading to his conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire in the Aude region of southern France has been labeled a "catastrophe on an unprecedented scale" by the country's prime minister. The blaze, which is the largest in France since 1949, has scorched an area bigger than Paris and has been linked to global warming and severe drought conditions. The fire has resulted in at least one death, numerous injuries, and has forced thousands of firefighters to work continuously to contain its spread, which is being exacerbated by strong winds and dry vegetation.</p>
