          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:59:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is actively exploring the suspension of habeas corpus for migrants, a constitutional right that allows individuals to challenge their detention in court. Miller justified this consideration by arguing that the U.S. faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts, however, argue that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without congressional authorization, referencing historical instances where Congress approved such suspensions during times of invasion or rebellion, so this would be an extreme executive overreach. The decision hinges on whether the courts align with the administration's immigration policies. Optimism score is low due to the potential infringement on constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, from immigration detention, citing concerns that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained for six weeks, allegedly in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel she co-wrote in a student newspaper. The judge emphasized that there was no evidence she posed a threat to American foreign policy interests beyond the op-ed. The judge said he wanted to give Ms. Ozturk maximum mobility so she could pursue the educational opportunities that she needed to complete her doctorate. Her lawyer accused the government of detaining her in retaliation for speech that is protected by the First Amendment.</p>

The FAA confirmed a telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark's airspace. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, including new air traffic control centers and upgrades to telecommunications systems, but these upgrades could take up to four years. United Airlines is limiting flights to and from Newark, and Senator Charles Schumer called the situation an air travel safety emergency requiring immediate action.</p>

          <p>Despite video evidence of a savage beating, a jury acquitted three former officers involved in the death of Tyre Nichols, highlighting the challenges of securing murder convictions against police officers. This verdict underscores the stalled progress of police reform, both locally in Memphis and nationally. The article discusses the political climate and the Trump administration's policies that favor more brutal policing. The author argues that the failure to secure murder convictions and bring greater accountability means that Nichols will not be the last to suffer an unjust death.</p>
