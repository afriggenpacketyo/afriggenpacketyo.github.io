          <p>Following devastating flash floods in Central Texas, President Trump met with affected families and first responders in Kerrville. Expressing the "anguish of our entire nation," he promised federal support and surveyed the extensive damage. The visit comes as the death toll has risen to 121, with search and rescue operations still underway for over 170 missing people. The president has signed a federal disaster declaration for the region, enabling FEMA to assist in the recovery efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of capital into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, these ETFs recorded their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally is also attributed to speculation about future Federal Reserve interest rate policies and potential crypto-friendly legislation. This upward momentum triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further propelling the price higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the ongoing case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who was wrongfully deported and then returned to the U.S., his lawyers have asked a federal judge for a protective order. They are requesting that the government be required to provide at least 72 hours' notice before any future attempt to deport him. The judge expressed frustration with the government's lack of a clear plan for Abrego Garcia's due process. The case highlights significant concerns over the handling of immigration and deportation procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government posted an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely driven by a 301% year-over-year increase in customs duties from tariffs. This monthly surplus helped narrow the fiscal year-to-date deficit, which still stands at $1.34 trillion with three months remaining. While receipts were up, the report also highlighted the persistent burden of interest on the national debt, which remains a major category of government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting the agency to ask some recently laid-off staff to return to work temporarily. Officials blame new bureaucratic processes implemented by the Trump administration for stalling the funds, which support programs for unaccompanied migrant children, domestic violence hotlines, and HIV resources. The delays are forcing the department into an "all hands on deck" sprint to process the grants before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
