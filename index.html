          <p>Swarthmore borough police dismantled a pro-Palestinian encampment at Swarthmore College, resulting in the arrest of nine activists, including students and individuals from outside the college community. College President Valerie Smith cited rising safety concerns and a lack of willingness from protesters to engage in conversation as reasons for seeking law enforcement assistance. The sweep followed the interim suspension of seven students for erecting the encampment, which Swarthmore’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) group claimed disproportionately affected students of color and low-income students. The college is also under investigation for alleged antisemitic harassment on campus.</p>
