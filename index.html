          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's former President Yoon Suk Yeol, has been indicted on charges of bribery and market manipulation, marking a historic first for the country. She is accused of amassing over $720,000 in criminal proceeds through stock manipulation and accepting bribes, including illicit profits from a stock scheme and free opinion poll data. Her husband, Yoon, is also facing charges of insurrection over his martial law bid, and former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was indicted for abetting Yoon. The probes leading to these charges involved raids on a church and a joint U.S.-South Korean air base, sparking concerns from then-U.S. President Donald Trump. Optimism is relatively low given the serious nature of the charges and the political turmoil in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are co-chairing a Franco-German Ministerial Council in Toulon, the first since Germany’s government change. The meeting brings together ten ministers from each side to focus on economic and security policy, with both leaders emphasizing the importance of their partnership for Europe's future. Simultaneously, Germany's defense and foreign affairs ministers are meeting counterparts in Copenhagen to discuss military aid for Ukraine and the situation in Gaza, addressing Russia's recent airstrikes and potential EU measures. Macron stressed the renewed partnership could drive Europe forward, while Merz called it an axis within the EU. The current political crisis in France adds complexity to the discussions.</p>

          <p>The United States has ended the "de minimis" exemption that allowed low-value parcels shipped to the country to avoid tariffs. This change, enacted through an executive order signed by President Trump, aims to close what the White House calls a "catastrophic loophole" used to evade tariffs and funnel illicit goods into the U.S. The exemption, previously applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, had allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods tax-free, and there will be a six-month transition period with a flat duty depending on the country of origin. The de minimis provision was initially added to the Tariff Act of 1930 to facilitate trade by reducing the administrative burden of collecting duties on low-cost goods.</p>

          <p>Australian crocodile wrangler Matt Wright has been found guilty of lying to police and pressuring a hospitalized witness after a fatal helicopter crash in 2022. Wright, a former Netflix star, faced charges of perverting the course of justice related to the incident, in which his friend and co-star Chris "Willow" Wilson died. The investigation revealed that the helicopter's engine stopped mid-flight due to a lack of fuel, and Wright was convicted of lying about the amount of fuel in the machine and asking the injured pilot to falsify flight records. Despite the guilty verdicts, Wright's lawyers intend to appeal, and he has been released on bail.</p>

Small businesses fear increased costs and new barriers to competing with larger brands, with many halting shipments due to uncertainty about the expenses. The changes mean packages will face a 10% tariff rate, potentially adding $30 to $50 in costs to a typical $100 order, and some postal services have temporarily paused deliveries to the US over confusion about the rules. The Federation of Small Businesses is urging the UK government to provide more support to help businesses cope with the extra costs.</p>

          <p>European leaders have expressed outrage following Russia's deadliest strikes on Kyiv since July, which resulted in the deaths of at least 23 people and damaged the EU's delegation office. The attack, which involved nearly 600 drones and over 30 ballistic and cruise missiles, targeted a residential building and also hit the British Council. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the strikes as a reminder that Russia would stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated the need for new sanctions. The US special envoy on Ukraine stated that Russia's attacks threatened the peace President Trump was pursuing, and the EU is preparing a 19th package of sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone with a design strikingly similar to the unidentified flying object known as "Gimbal," which was spotted by US Navy pilots in 2015. This new aircraft features an elliptical, ringlike wing that seamlessly integrates a straight central wing section, forming a closed-loop structure. Four rotors are mounted at junctions between the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers, serving as both lift generators and structural reinforcements. While still experimental, this drone represents a radical change in aerodynamic design that could improve endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight.</p>

The stock's rise was fueled by China's policy support for local artificial intelligence (AI) chips and a new AI model from DeepSeek designed for domestic chips. However, Cambricon reminded investors that its stock price could deviate from current fundamentals, and it is subject to U.S. export restrictions that could impact its supply chain.

The Department of Health and Social Care estimates that chickenpox causes approximately £24 million in lost income and productivity annually in the UK, and the vaccine will dramatically reduce the number of chickenpox cases overall.

A six-month transition period is in place, allowing postal service shippers to pay a flat duty of $80-$200 per package, depending on the country of origin. The move broadens the Trump administration’s cancellation of the de minimis exemption for shipments from China and Hong Kong earlier this year, and the Trump administration blames the exemption for allowing narcotics to flow into the US. Foreign postal agencies can collect duties based on package value or opt for the flat rate method, and full duty collection is required by February 2026.</p>

A six-month transition allows shippers to pay a flat fee of $80 to $200 per item, depending on the country of origin's tariff rate. The Trump administration said major shipping companies are prepared for the change, and small packages have become "really deadly smuggling devices."</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, alleging misrepresentations about her mortgage and government ethics filings. Pulte's referral implicitly addresses arguments that Trump does not have the power to legally remove Cook from the board for cause because Pulte's first criminal referral relates to conduct that allegedly occurred before she joined the Fed. The referral includes images of Pulte's letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and top DOJ official Ed Martin, laying out the allegations about Cook. Earlier, Cook sued Trump, asking a federal judge to block the president from removing her from the central bank.</p>

          <p>Investigators have stated that the attacker who opened fire on pupils at a church in Minneapolis was "obsessed with the idea of killing children." Robin Westman, who killed two children and injured 18 others, did not appear to have a specific motive, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, and the murdered children have been identified as Fletcher Merkel and Harper Moyski. The 23-year-old suspect approached the Annunciation Church and fired dozens of shots through the windows using three firearms. US Attorney General Joseph Thompson said the shooter expressed hate towards many groups, including the Jewish community and President Trump.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have requested a judge to bar top Trump administration officials from making "baseless public attacks" against their client, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The motion was filed after federal officials attacked Abrego Garcia in the media, violating his right to a fair trial, and the government's statements could taint any conceivable jury pool. Abrego Garcia faces criminal prosecution for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants and possible deportation to East Africa, and his lawyers argue the government could make it harder for Abrego Garcia to call defense witnesses. A DHS official responded that Abrego Garcia should not have entered the country illegally and committed crimes.</p>

          <p>Four senior officials with the CDC have resigned, citing concerns about growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines. Dr. Debra Houry and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis stepped down after the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, and the officials pointed to altered or withdrawn evidence reviews and a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. They criticized the handling of vaccine policy, expressing concerns that decisions were being made before data supported them, and described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule through social media. The resignations have sparked calls for oversight, with senators calling for investigations and criticizing the administration's actions.</p>
