          <p>Big Lots is set to reopen 132 stores across 14 states in May after filing for bankruptcy last September and being acquired by Gordon Brothers Retail Partners. Variety Wholesalers, which acquired 200 to 400 Big Lots stores as part of the deal, will continue to operate them under the Big Lots brand. The reopenings, building on those from April, will occur in two phases and aim to increase accessibility for customers in both large cities and small towns. This expansion follows a surge in store closures nationwide in 2024, with the company expressing excitement about bringing more locations back to life.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has urged a major reassessment of net zero policies, asserting that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is unsustainable. In a new report, Blair's institute argues that voters feel they are being asked to make sacrifices with minimal global impact, leading to a loss of faith in climate policies. Blair advocates for rapid deployment of carbon capture technology, AI-driven energy grid efficiency, and investment in small-scale nuclear reactors. While Downing Street maintains its commitment to net zero, Blair's intervention has sparked debate among political figures and environmental groups.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high credit card interest rates putting pressure on households, bankruptcy is becoming a more considered option for debt relief. Chapter 7 bankruptcy offers a quick way to erase unsecured debts like credit card balances, but may require giving up non-exempt assets and impacts credit for up to 10 years. Chapter 13 bankruptcy sets up a repayment plan over three to five years, allowing individuals to protect assets while paying back some debt, but it requires strict adherence to a court-approved plan and impacts credit for up to seven years. Alternatives such as debt settlement, debt management plans, and debt consolidation loans should also be explored before deciding on bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

Rubasingham pitched the Stormzy collaboration as part of her application for the job, saying his involvement would make for a "cut-through show that goes beyond theatre".

His comments follow the implementation of widespread tariff hikes, many of which have been paused for 90 days, excluding those on China.

          <p>Periods of high volatility in the stock market are often followed by strong stock returns, according to market analysts, suggesting that investors should consider holding or even buying more stocks during these times. The VIX index, a measure of market volatility, indicates that when it spikes above 40, the S&P 500 has historically risen by an average of 30% a year later. The odds of positive stock returns 12 months after such periods are also above 90%, according to a Wells Fargo Investment Institute analysis.</p>
