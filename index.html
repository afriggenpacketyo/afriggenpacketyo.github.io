          <p>According to newly declassified FBI documents, a Democratic staffer who worked for the House Intelligence Committee for over a decade has accused Rep. Adam Schiff of approving the leak of classified information. The whistleblower alleged that in a 2017 meeting, Schiff stated the committee would leak derogatory classified material to discredit and indict then-President Donald Trump. The staffer, who called the action "treasonous" and "illegal," reportedly attended the meeting personally and was most recently interviewed by the FBI in 2023. The documents were recently provided to Congress by FBI Director Kash Patel.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of anticompetitive behavior. Musk alleges that Apple is manipulating its App Store rankings to make it impossible for any AI company other than OpenAI to achieve the number one position. In a series of posts on his social media platform X, he questioned why his apps, X and Grok, were not featured in the "Must Have" section despite their high rankings. He suggested that Apple's actions might be politically motivated and constitute an "unequivocal antitrust violation."</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing significant tariff increases that were set to take effect. President Trump signed an executive order to formalize the extension, which will now expire on November 10. Under the agreement, Washington will maintain a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, while Beijing will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances, unfair practices, and national security concerns, including US restrictions on advanced technology sales to China.</p>

Domestically, a variant known as the GJ-2 serves in the People's Liberation Army, conducting patrols and exercises. Developed by the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation, the WL-2 is noted for its cost-effectiveness and has established itself as one of China's most successful military drone exports.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from AI data center chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This article analyzes the financial implications for Nvidia, concluding the impact will be a minor speed bump. While China-specific chips like the H20 represent a significant portion of revenue, the 15% payment is estimated to reduce total revenue by only 2-3%. Given Nvidia's high profitability and gross margins, the company is expected to easily absorb this cost, making the deal far preferable to having no sales in the Chinese market.

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, questioning its methodology and data accuracy in the past.

          <h2>Fact Check: Trump's Narrative on D.C. Crime Is Based on False and Misleading Claims</h2>

          <p>President Trump's justification for federalizing the D.C. police force is rooted in misleading narratives about crime, similar to his previous claims about Los Angeles. This article points out that while Trump focuses on a 2023 homicide spike, violent crime in D.C. is now at a 30-year low, with significant year-over-year decreases in homicides, robberies, and carjackings. Experts note that Trump's portrayal of a "lawless" city is contradicted by current data. Likewise, his claims linking homelessness to crime are challenged by studies showing unhoused individuals are far more likely to be victims of violence.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have filed a whistleblowing complaint with the Charity Commission, warning the organization is at risk of collapse. The complaint follows a threat from Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to withdraw public funding unless the institute pivots its focus to defense and national security research. Employees allege misuse of public funds, a "toxic internal culture," and a failure to deliver on its mission. The government stated it wants the institute to provide "real value for money," but staff fear the potential withdrawal of its £100m grant could be fatal.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter has revealed she feared teammate Lauren James would face "astronomical" racist abuse if she were the only player to miss a penalty in their Euro 2025 quarter-final shootout. Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, said it was a "sigh of relief" when other white players also missed, highlighting the disproportionate scrutiny Black players face. She described the abuse as making her feel "small" and "scared to play" in the final. The FA has referred the abuse to the police for investigation.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of a missing Scottish cyclist, Tony Parsons, was solved thanks to the actions of his killer's girlfriend. After Alexander McKellar confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had killed Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried the body, he took her to the remote grave site. Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later contacted the police, leading them to discover Parsons' remains. Parsons' family expressed immense gratitude for her bravery, stating that his body likely would never have been found otherwise.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin suggests his diplomatic focus is heavily centered on the Russian leader, leaving Ukrainian President Zelenskyy marginalized. Trump has ruled out a trilateral meeting and is framing the talks as a preliminary "feel out" meeting, while reiterating his belief that a "land swapping" deal could end the war. During a press conference, Trump made a verbal slip, saying "I'm going to Russia on Friday" when the meeting is in Alaska. This gaffe is interpreted as revealing how central Putin is to Trump's political narrative, both domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting at the White House, just days after demanding his immediate resignation. Last week, Trump had called Tan "highly CONFLICTED" over alleged ties to China, echoing concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton. Following a meeting that included the Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury, Trump issued a positive statement, saying Tan and his cabinet would bring him suggestions. This change of tone comes as the administration engages heavily with the semiconductor industry, including a recent revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year deal with Netflix, though it is reportedly less exclusive than their previous 2020 agreement. The new pact is a "first-look" deal for film and television projects, which differs from their original overall deal that covered overhead costs and gave Netflix exclusive rights to all developed content. The couple has produced several documentary and reality series for the streamer, including the popular "Harry & Meghan." Their upcoming projects include a new season of Meghan's cooking show and a film adaptation of a romance novel.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the South Park neighborhood of downtown. The project, proposed by New York-based Mack Real Estate Development, is planned for a site at 11th and Olive streets and would include 536 rental units and ground-floor retail space. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for construction, and the project faces a challenging financial climate. High interest rates, rising material costs, and labor instability are significant hurdles for new construction, despite high demand for housing in the city.</p>

          <p>New details have emerged about the recent attack on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, revealing the gunman fired over 180 shots into the campus. The barrage broke approximately 150 windows, including some that were "blast-resistant," causing extensive damage that may take months to repair. The attacker, a man who reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his mental health issues, killed a police officer before he died. No CDC employees were injured in the attack, but they have been advised to work from home this week.</p>
