        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese automaker Honda reported a 50% decrease in its first-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of analyst expectations. The company attributes the sharp decline to the financial pressures from U.S. auto tariffs and the negative effects of a stronger yen on its export-heavy business. Despite the profit plunge, Honda has raised its full-year operating profit forecast, anticipating a weaker yen and planning to mitigate tariff impacts by increasing production within the United States. In a contrasting performance, the company's motorcycle division achieved its highest-ever quarterly operating profit, driven by strong sales in emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The diplomatic push comes as Russia has intensified its aerial attacks, setting a new monthly record for missile and drone strikes on Ukraine in July.

          <p>The Swiss-headquartered mining company Glencore has decided to maintain its primary stock market listing in London, providing a significant boost to the London Stock Exchange. After a formal review, the company concluded that a move to a U.S. exchange would not create additional value for its shareholders at this time. The decision comes as Glencore reported a first-half net loss of $655 million, citing lower commodity prices and uncertainty from U.S. tariff policies. This move contrasts with other major firms like Ashtead Group and Flutter, which have recently shifted their listings from London to New York. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this growth, the company is implementing cost-cutting measures and sharpening its commercial focus following a recent guidance slash and subsequent stock price decline. The company faces increased competition from compounded drug makers and rival Eli Lilly, as well as pressure from the White House to lower U.S. prescription drug prices. Novo Nordisk reiterated its full-year outlook but is bracing for a challenging market environment and potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of joint military exercises, the navies of China and Russia have commenced combined patrols in the Pacific Ocean. The drills focused on establishing real-time communication channels to exchange hydrographic, weather, and surveillance information between the two forces. Chinese state media reported that the naval group encountered aircraft and ships from third-party countries during their maneuvers. This operation, which involved the Chinese destroyer Shaoxing's first overseas exercise, included transit through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan, underscoring the deepening military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow.</p>

          <p>The BBC has proceeded with broadcasting a new series of MasterChef, which was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired over misconduct allegations. The decision has drawn criticism from groups like the Bectu union, but the BBC stated it was the right choice for the contestants involved. The new episodes have been edited to reduce the hosts' presence and banter, and one contestant was removed at her own request. The controversy stems from a report that upheld over 40 complaints against Wallace and one against Torode, prompting a debate about accountability in the broadcast industry.</p>

Separately, a new survey by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce reveals widespread concern among German businesses about the recent EU-U.S. tariff agreement. A majority of the surveyed companies anticipate that the deal, which subjects most EU exports to a 15% tariff, will increase their operational burdens. (not investment advice)</p>

Royal experts suggest this legal entanglement could make the royal family more cautious about engaging in peace talks with the Sussexes. The conflict centers on claims Meghan made in her 2021 Oprah Winfrey interview, which Samantha alleges were defamatory.</p>

The report, based on Ukrainian Air Force data, shows a sharp increase in munitions launched, reaching the highest levels of the war. This escalation coincides with pauses in U.S. military aid and a significant ramp-up in Russian missile and drone production.

          <p>An economic think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must implement tax increases to cover a projected £41.2 billion budget shortfall. To meet her self-imposed borrowing rules, Niesr recommends a sustained increase in taxes, potentially through council tax reform or prolonging the freeze on income tax thresholds. This puts the Chancellor in a difficult position, as she must choose between her spending commitments, her manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people, and her fiscal rules. The shortfall is attributed to weakening economic growth and the watering down of planned welfare cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Great Barrier Reef has suffered its largest annual loss of live coral on record, according to a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The decline is a direct result of a severe and widespread mass coral bleaching event in early 2024, which was caused by unprecedented levels of heat stress from record-high ocean temperatures. Scientists observed that the northern and southern regions of the reef were hit hardest, with coral cover dropping by as much as one-third. This increased volatility indicates the ecosystem is under extreme stress, primarily driven by the impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. His performance provided a much-needed spark for the team, which had struggled offensively during the month he was sidelined with a knee injury. Muncy's comeback is seen as a crucial de facto acquisition for the Dodgers, who were relatively quiet at the trade deadline. The game also saw other slumping hitters like Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernández show signs of breaking out, boosting hopes for a strong offensive push down the stretch.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in northern Mexico are struggling with a severe economic crisis after the U.S. suspended live cattle imports due to concerns over the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. This is the third such suspension in eight months, devastating a sector already weakened by prolonged drought and hitting a cattle export business worth over $1.2 billion last year. The parasite, which can be fatal to livestock, is spreading north from southern Mexico, prompting U.S. authorities to take drastic measures. In response, Mexican ranchers are forced to sell cattle domestically at significant losses and diversify into other ventures to survive.</p>

Roa describes the desperate search and the collective action of the grandmothers, who faced threats and danger to demand answers from the authoritarian government. Although she was eventually reunited with her granddaughter, she vows to continue the search for the nearly 300 others who remain missing, with a new generation now taking up the cause.</p>

The Met, which is doubling its use of LFR, claims it is a vital tool that has led to over 1,000 arrests this year.

          <p>Less than three months after lifting long-standing sanctions, the Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the move is symbolic and sends a calculated message that Washington intends to retain economic leverage over Syria's new transitional government. The country is in dire need of foreign investment to rebuild after 13 years of devastating civil war, and the steep tariffs threaten to restrict any potential for meaningful trade with the U.S. The policy could be a tool to pressure Damascus on political matters, including relations with Israel.
