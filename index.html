          <p>CBS News reports from Moscow, where preparations are underway for the annual "Victory Day" parade commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. The invitation extended to CBS News and other U.S. outlets reflects improving relations between the U.S. and Russia under President Trump. Despite the celebratory atmosphere, the article highlights the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where fighting continues and a ceasefire remains elusive, even as President Trump pushes for diplomatic solutions. The article also mentions China's President Xi Jinping visit, where he signed over 20 bilateral cooperation documents.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak Office of the Inspector General report revealed that over 100 current and former employees conspired with New York medical professionals to defraud the company's health care plan of over $12 million. The scheme involved employees accepting cash in exchange for their insurance information, which was then used to file fraudulent claims for services never provided. Twelve employees and three healthcare providers have been criminally charged, and Amtrak is considering disciplinary action for the remaining active employees involved. The OIG began investigating after noticing unusual billing patterns between the healthcare providers and a high number of shared Amtrak employees as patients.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill to restrict property ownership in Texas by citizens of China passed the stateâ€™s House of Representatives. The bill also targets nationals from Iran, North Korea, and Russia, identified as national security threats. Critics, including Democratic representatives and Asian-American groups, have denounced the bill as xenophobic and discriminatory. The bill is intended to protect Texans from influence by foreign adversaries.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer will travel to Ukraine alongside other world leaders to urge Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the war. He is joined by President Emmanuel Macron of France, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Friedrich Merz, who is making his first trip to Ukraine since becoming Germany's chancellor this week. The leaders are using the visit to urge Russia to "agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire" - a proposal initially made by US President Donald Trump. The leaders also vowed to "ratchet up pressure on Russia's war machine".</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates after an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff spotted a suspicious invitation to a meeting earlier on Friday and realized it was "spear-phishing" - which impersonates a trusted source. Parents have been sent texts telling that them students' passwords have been reset as a precaution - meaning pupils studying for exams do not currently have access to their school's learning resources. The council said pupils preparing for exams would be given priority support following what it called a "difficult but necessary" decision.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a highly contagious liver infection. Cases have remained unusually high so far in 2025. Officials say that levels of the virus in local wastewater suggest these figures are an undercount. The infection is spread through food or drinks contaminated by stool from an infected person, and it can also spread through close contact with someone who is carrying the virus, even if they donâ€™t show any symptoms. The best way to prevent a hepatitis A infection is through vaccination.</p>

Despite video evidence and quick action by the police chief, the three former officers escaped murder convictions, reflecting a broader trend of stalled police reform. The article argues that the failure to secure convictions and the pullback on systemic reforms indicate a bleak outlook for addressing the police-brutality problem.</p>
