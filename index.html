          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 13:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical experts are discussing the benefits of "hydration multipliers" compared to traditional water for staying hydrated during summer heatwaves. They advise that while water is generally sufficient, electrolyte drinks can be advantageous for individuals undertaking intense physical activity or sweating heavily, as these products replenish vital minerals like sodium and potassium. However, professionals also caution that these supplements often contain high levels of salt and artificial sweeteners, which may pose risks for people with conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Therefore, for routine daily hydration, plain water is still the most recommended and safest option for the general population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis identifies the most expensive states in the U.S. for 2025, where the cost of living remains exceptionally high due to inflation and other economic factors. States like California, Hawaii, and Florida are highlighted for their steep housing costs and rising homeowners insurance premiums, which significantly burden household budgets. The report details how factors such as high demand for housing, extreme weather events, and local price levels for goods and services contribute to the financial strain on residents. This article provides a state-by-state breakdown of costs for basic items, energy bills, and average home prices in key metropolitan areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tax Professionals Warn of Potential 'SALT Torpedo' for High Earners in New Trump Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 13:19:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tax experts are highlighting a potential issue within President Trump's latest tax legislation concerning the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The bill temporarily increases the SALT deduction limit to $40,000 but includes a phaseout for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000. This rapid phaseout could create a so-called "SALT torpedo," resulting in an unexpectedly high effective federal tax rate, potentially reaching 45.5% on income within that specific range. Professionals advise high-income earners nearing this threshold to seek tax advice to strategize and potentially mitigate this significant tax impact. (not investment advice)</p>

Morgan Stanley raised its price target for Amazon, citing manageable tariff impacts and accelerating growth in its AWS cloud business, which pushed the stock higher. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock continued to rise following its historic achievement of a $4 trillion market capitalization and a significant meeting between CEO Jensen Huang and President Trump. The article suggests this meeting could be an olive branch to China regarding the export of previous-generation Nvidia chips, adding to investor optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

Emergency room visits for COVID-19 have reached their highest levels since February in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. This article outlines four key strategies: credit counseling, credit card debt forgiveness, lender hardship programs, and bankruptcy. Credit counseling and debt management plans can help by negotiating lower interest rates, while debt forgiveness aims to settle debts for less than the full amount owed. Hardship programs offer temporary relief like paused payments, and bankruptcy can provide a more comprehensive solution for overwhelming debt by discharging or restructuring it under legal protection. Each option has distinct qualifications and consequences for a person's credit.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, most notably the 7/7 London bombings and the subsequent mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by police, for which the force was found to have breached health and safety laws. Lord Blair, who joined the police in 1974, rose through the ranks and led Surrey Police before becoming deputy commissioner of the Met. He resigned in 2008 after losing the confidence of the newly elected London mayor, Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a bill repealing a voter-approved law that guaranteed paid sick leave and inflationary adjustments to the state's minimum wage. The original measure, passed by ballot initiative just eight months prior, will be nullified on August 28, a move celebrated by business groups as a rollback of burdensome mandates. Worker advocacy groups, who had campaigned extensively for the benefits, condemned the repeal as a betrayal of families who need sick leave to care for their children without losing pay. Proponents of the repealed law are now considering a new ballot initiative to reinstate the provisions as a constitutional amendment.</p>

The album features collaborations with several rappers and includes spoken-word tracks addressing the pressures of fame and his personal life.

While Social Security income does not automatically disqualify someone, the process has unique considerations. Because Social Security benefits are legally protected from most creditors, individuals have significant leverage in negotiations, and their fixed income can help demonstrate the financial hardship required for settlement. However, the ability to save enough money for a lump-sum payment can be a major challenge. The article advises weighing the pros and cons, such as stress from collection efforts versus the relief of resolving the debt, and considering alternative strategies like credit counseling.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts declining, high-yield savings accounts remain an attractive alternative, though the economic landscape presents new considerations. A key advantage is that rates are still high, offering significant returns compared to standard accounts. However, a major disadvantage is the potential for these rates to fall, as banks may act preemptively ahead of anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. While these accounts offer crucial flexibility for accessing funds, savers may need to use online-only banks to secure the best rates, which can be a drawback for those who prefer physical branches.

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly reforms the federal student loan system, aiming to simplify repayment and control borrowing. The legislation reduces the number of repayment plans from seven to two: a standard 10-to-25-year plan and a new income-driven option, the Repayment Assistance Plan, which extends payments up to 30 years. It also introduces borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and graduate loans, eliminating the Grad PLUS loan program for new students after July 2026. Additionally, the law tightens eligibility for Pell Grants for students on full scholarships while expanding it for those in short-term workforce training programs. (not investment advice)</p>

The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential for an increased federal deficit, which can be a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. This sharp price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further propelling the upward momentum in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The number of pubs in the UK has declined by 15,000 since 2000, and the trend continues as landlords struggle to absorb costs without alienating customers.

          <p>UEFA has ruled that Crystal Palace will be demoted from next season's Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules. The decision is based on John Textor's ownership stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. UEFA regulations prevent two clubs with the same influential owner from competing in the same tournament. Because Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, they take precedence.
