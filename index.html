          <p>President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to travel to Moscow this week for what is being described as a final attempt to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine. This diplomatic mission comes as a 10-day ultimatum issued by Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to expire, threatening sanctions if a deal is not reached. The White House has expressed growing frustration over the lack of progress after six months of diplomacy. Ukrainian officials view this visit as Russia's last chance to halt the conflict before facing significant economic penalties, though some are skeptical of the potential outcome.</p>

          <p>A tense rivalry between American Olympic sprinters Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek escalated during and after the 200-meter final at the U.S. championships. Lyles won the race but stared down Bednarek just before the finish line, prompting Bednarek to shove him afterward. Although they shook hands, a subsequent joint interview and later comments revealed lingering animosity between the two teammates. Bednarek called Lyles' actions unsportsmanlike and referenced personal issues that need to be handled, suggesting their on-track competition will remain heated.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a 4% year-over-year dip in its second-quarter operating earnings, falling to $11.16 billion. The decline was primarily driven by lower insurance underwriting profits, though its railroad, energy, and retail businesses saw gains. The conglomerate issued a strong warning about the potential negative consequences of U.S. tariffs on its diverse operations and investments. The company's cash reserves remained substantial at $344.1 billion, and it continued to be a net seller of stocks without repurchasing any of its own shares. (not investment advice)</p>

Industry groups have warned that it would be very difficult for companies to absorb such a high tariff. The situation has increased the risk of a recession in Switzerland and put deflationary pressure on the Swiss National Bank, creating significant economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CK Asset Holdings has issued a formal statement denying widespread social media rumors that Hong Kong's wealthiest family, the Lis, are selling their iconic residence at 79 Deep Water Bay Road. The company, on behalf of chairman Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, labeled the speculation as "entirely fabricated" and "groundless." The denial comes during a period of economic strain in Hong Kong, where high interest rates have forced some other prominent families to sell assets. Li urged the public to be cautious of such rumors to avoid potential scams.</p>

The bank announced plans to accelerate the yuan's use in global trade, enhance its financing functions, and strengthen offshore markets. This initiative includes developing overseas clearing banks through its Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This marks the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been a dedicated section in the central bank's midyear policy meeting readout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The trade body for the UK's car finance industry has criticized the financial regulator's proposed redress scheme for mis-selling as "completely impractical." The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) expressed concern that the scheme could cover loans from as far back as 2007, a period for which both firms and customers may no longer have the necessary paperwork. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a consultation on the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9bn and £18bn to compensate affected motorists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The practice of African leaders and elites seeking medical care in foreign countries has highlighted the systemic issues within their own public health systems. A key reason for this medical tourism is the severe underinvestment in local healthcare, with many African nations failing to meet the Abuja Declaration's target of allocating 15% of their national budgets to health. This lack of funding results in poorly equipped hospitals, a shortage of specialized treatments for conditions like cancer and heart disease, and frequent strikes by underpaid medical professionals.</p>

The body, particularly the kidneys, is also highly effective at regulating electrolyte levels. These drinks can be useful for elite athletes or individuals engaged in prolonged, heavy sweating, but for average daily hydration, plain water is sufficient and more economical.</p>
