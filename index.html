          <p>A court hearing is underway for the sentencing of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on prostitution-related charges. This proceeding follows a high-profile trial where Combs was acquitted of more severe charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking, but found guilty on lesser counts. The sentencing marks a significant moment in the legal battles surrounding Combs, who has faced numerous allegations and lawsuits over the past year. The outcome will determine the penalties he faces after spending approximately 13 months in federal custody awaiting the trial's conclusion.</p>

          <p>A growing body of data indicates that recent college graduates are facing significant challenges in securing their first full-time jobs, feeling the effects of a weakening labor market more acutely than other groups. The unemployment rate for new workforce entrants has reached a nine-year peak, narrowing the historical employment gap between those with bachelor's degrees and those with only high school diplomas. This trend, attributed to increased competition, a hiring slowdown, and the potential impact of AI on entry-level roles, is causing widespread stress and forcing many graduates to alter their career expectations and living situations.</p>

          <p>Furloughed employees of the Small Business Administration (SBA) have set up automated email replies that directly blame Senate Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown. The auto-responses claim the shutdown prevents the SBA from serving millions of small businesses, stopping an estimated 320 businesses from accessing $170 million in funding each day. This internal messaging, suggested in a memo from SBA's human resources, aligns with the Republican argument that Democrats blocked a funding bill over unrelated policy disputes. The move highlights the escalating political tensions and direct impact of the shutdown on federal agencies and the businesses they support.</p>

          <p>A large fire erupted at the Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, Los Angeles County, following reports of an explosion on Thursday night. Fire crews, including the refinery's own fire department, responded quickly and successfully contained the blaze to a specific area, preventing the need for residential evacuations. While no injuries have been reported, officials advised residents to stay indoors due to potential impacts on air quality, although initial monitoring showed no elevated levels of toxins. The incident, which occurred at the largest producing oil refinery on the West Coast, did not affect operations at the nearby Los Angeles International Airport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new findings from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), mothers in England experience a substantial and long-term decrease in their earnings after having children. The data shows that five years after the birth of their first child, mothers' monthly earnings are, on average, over £1,000 lower compared to their pre-child salary. This "motherhood penalty" is attributed to factors like unaffordable childcare, an unbalanced parental leave system, and maternity discrimination, contributing significantly to the overall gender pay gap. Campaign groups argue the issue is systemic and avoidable, not just an unfair reality for working mothers.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has brought high winds and heavy rain to Northern Ireland and Scotland, prompting the closure of hundreds of schools and the cancellation of events and travel services. The Met Office issued amber and yellow weather warnings, with wind gusts expected to reach up to 80 mph in coastal areas. In response, the Education Authority in Northern Ireland directed schools in several counties to close early as a safety precaution. Ferry services and flights have also been affected, and police are warning drivers about hazardous conditions due to surface water on the roads.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago Transit Authority projects, citing the need for a review into the city's race-based contracting requirements. The move affects the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization projects and follows similar freezes of funds for projects in New York City and green energy initiatives in Democrat-led states. Critics view these actions as politically motivated tactics to pressure Democrats during the federal government shutdown. The administration claims the review is necessary to ensure compliance with a new rule barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace the loss of buying power. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some six-month and one-year CDs offering APYs above 4%. Currently, short-term CDs often provide better rates than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, savers should compare offers from different institutions, particularly online banks which tend to have lower overhead and more competitive yields.

          <h2>Astronomers Observe Rogue Planet Undergoing Massive 'Growth Spurt'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 08:48:03 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a free-floating rogue planet outside our solar system that is undergoing a massive and unstable growth spurt. The planet, named Cha 1107-7626, is consuming surrounding gas and dust at an unprecedented rate of six billion tonnes per second. Observations from the European Southern Observatory revealed that the planet's rate of accretion—the process of accumulating mass—is the strongest ever recorded for a planetary-mass object. This discovery blurs the lines between star and planet formation, suggesting that some rogue planets may form through processes similar to those of stars, including the generation of strong magnetic fields.</p>

          <p>Dame Sarah Mullally, the current Bishop of London, has been named the next Archbishop of Canterbury, becoming the first woman to be appointed to the highest office in the Church of England. A former chief nursing officer for the NHS, Mullally became a priest in 2006 and has risen to become the third most senior member of the clergy. Her appointment is a historic moment for the Church, which has been led by men for nearly 500 years. She succeeds Justin Welby, who resigned over his handling of a safeguarding scandal, and will face challenges including declining attendance and internal divisions.</p>

          <p>Unidentified drone sightings caused significant disruptions at Germany's Munich Airport, forcing a temporary suspension of flights that affected nearly 3,000 passengers. The incident is the latest in a series of similar events across Europe, with Belgian defense officials also investigating multiple drone sightings over a military base near the German border. While the origin of the drones remains unknown, there is widespread suspicion among European leaders that Russia may be responsible for the flights. These incursions are viewed as potential attempts to probe NATO's security and air defense capabilities amid heightened regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Though cumbia originated in Colombia, the genre has found a vibrant and unique home in the migrant neighborhoods of Monterrey, Mexico. This is the land of the "sonideros," DJs who have curated and spread tropical music since the 1960s, creating a distinct subculture. An accidental slowing of a record at a party gave birth to "cumbia rebajada," a slower-paced style that became a hallmark of the local scene. This cultural movement, known as Kolombia, blended musical obsession with the aesthetics of Los Angeles' "cholo" style, creating a lasting identity that has endured through periods of social hardship and violence.</p>

          <p>The execution of a prisoner in Taiwan, the first in five years, has reignited the debate over the country's retention of capital punishment. Activists argue the execution was carried out unlawfully while an appeal was pending, defying a recent Constitutional Court ruling that narrowed the scope of the death penalty. Supporters of capital punishment cite public opinion and its perceived deterrent effect, while opponents argue it violates human rights and risks wrongful executions. The issue places Taiwan, often praised for its democratic progress, in a difficult position on the international stage, as many allies have abolished the practice.</p>

Abrego Garcia had previously been granted a withholding of removal, which should have protected him from deportation to El Salvador due to likely persecution.

Speaking at Italian Tech Week, Solomon compared the current excitement around AI to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, suggesting that the market has likely run ahead of the technology's actual potential. He predicts that while there will be big winners, a lot of invested capital will not deliver returns, leading to a market reset.
