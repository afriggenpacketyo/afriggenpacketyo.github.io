          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will cut off all new federal research grants to Harvard University, citing concerns over antisemitism, discrimination, lack of academic rigor, and mismanagement. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated Harvard has a systemic pattern of violating federal law, leading to the decision. Harvard responded by accusing the administration of illegally withholding funding for lifesaving research and innovation in retaliation for a lawsuit the university filed, asserting it will continue to comply with the law and defend against government overreach. Federal student loan funding and Pell Grants will not be affected by this decision.</p>

          <p>The Peruvian government has temporarily suspended gold mining in the northern district of Pataz for 30 days following the discovery of 13 murdered security guards who were employees of a subcontractor of the mining company Poderosa.

Poderosa claims that 39 of its workers have been killed recently by criminal gangs linked to illegal mining, and the mining suspension only applies to informal miners.</p>

          <p>Utah is struggling to save the Great Salt Lake from drying up, an environmental crisis with health and economic consequences extending beyond the state. Despite state lawmakers' efforts to overhaul water laws, critics argue that the pace and scale of these measures are insufficient to prevent a public health disaster and ecosystem collapse. The lake's decline threatens industries reliant on its minerals and brine shrimp, while exposing toxic dust plumes. The state faces challenges in balancing conservation with the needs of agriculture and real estate development, hindering progress towards restoring the lake to a healthy elevation.</p>

          <p>Roger Lowenstein reflects on Warren Buffett's imminent retirement, highlighting his unparalleled investment acumen and integrity within American capitalism. Buffett's long-term focus, aversion to Wall Street's chicanery, and commitment to shareholders have defined his career. His success was rooted in evaluating publicly available data, rather than privileged access, and he maintained a personal connection with those he interacted with. Buffett's role in stabilizing the financial system during the 2008 crisis underscores his irreplaceable presence as a figure of trust and stability, leaving a void as he prepares to step down at 95.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to instruct a super PAC on how to support his mayoral bid. This practice, known as "red-boxing," involves posting strategic information publicly for big money groups to see, circumventing direct communication restrictions. The New York City Campaign Finance Board issued a warning about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and an opponent has requested an investigation into potential coordination between Cuomo's campaign and the Fix the City super PAC.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway stock experienced a decline following Warren Buffett's announcement of his retirement as CEO at the end of the year. The news, revealed during Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, led to investor uncertainty about the company's future leadership. Other factors contributing to the stock's drop include missed earnings estimates and market reactions to uncertain trade policies. While Greg Abel will succeed Buffett as CEO, analysts suggest investors are adjusting to the absence of Buffett's influence.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest President Trump has become disengaged from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, potentially giving Prime Minister Netanyahu a free hand in Gaza. Despite earlier diplomatic efforts, Trump's administration has shifted focus, leading to concerns about a potential escalation of violence. While Trump has shown sporadic concern for Gazans, his attention has been limited. The shift is evident in the portfolio of Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who now juggles multiple missions, including the Iran file.</p>

With Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, manufacturers in China are seeking alternative markets like India, leading to concerns about "dumping." Despite assurances from China, anxieties about dumping are spreading across various sectors in India, with the country's trade deficit with China already ballooning.

          <p>A fatal plane crash in Simi Valley, involving a kit-built aircraft, has put a spotlight on the safety and regulation of these experimental planes. The crash, which killed two passengers and a dog, is the second in five months involving that model of aircraft. The FAA said the single-engine Vans RV-10, a fixed-wing airplane, departed from Lancaster en route to Camarillo on Saturday. Kit planes are popular due to their lower cost, but the incident has raised concerns about accident rates and regulatory oversight.</p>

Top aides like Stephen Miller argue that due process is meant to protect citizens, not foreign trespassers, framing the issue as a matter of national security.</p>
