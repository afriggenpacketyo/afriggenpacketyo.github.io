        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth in April slowed to 5.1%, missing analyst expectations, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the Chinese economy. However, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding expectations, suggesting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was not as severe as anticipated. The statistics bureau acknowledged external uncertainties and the need to consolidate the foundation for sustained economic recovery. The real estate sector continues to face challenges, with home prices declining, and overall domestic demand lacking momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating has amplified worries about President Trump's policies and the overall health of the American economy. This downgrade, combined with concerns over growing government debt and a bill in Congress that could further increase the federal deficit, is threatening financial market stability. The downgrade could potentially undermine the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, leading to higher premiums for U.S. debt. Analysts suggest the downgrade highlights fiscal spending and interest rates in other countries as well, potentially triggering volatility in global markets.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The diagnosis came after Biden sought medical attention for urinary symptoms, with doctors discovering a nodule on his prostate. Characterized by a Gleason score of 9, the cancer is considered high-grade, but is reportedly hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options, with medical experts noting that while a cure may not be possible, treatments can help stabilize the patient and control the cancer.</p>

          <p>NATO's Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) is under investigation for possible corruption involving arms and ammunition contracts, with several detentions made across Europe. The investigation was initiated by the agency itself and involves allegations that NSPA employees or former employees provided confidential information to defense contractors. This probe highlights the importance of oversight in defense spending, particularly as NATO countries increase their military budgets amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Transparency International emphasizes that the defense sector is especially vulnerable to corruption due to high secrecy levels and large sums of money involved.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee revived President Trump's bill to cut taxes and spending after a group of fiscally conservative Republicans initially blocked its advancement. After negotiations, the Republicans switched their votes to "present", allowing the measure to move forward without their explicit support. The bill aims to make President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, while also increasing spending on the military and immigration enforcement. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies would partially offset the bill's costs.</p>

          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, has spoken out, stating that his son changed after moving to Twentynine Palms.

The FBI is treating the incident as an act of terrorism and seeking public assistance to identify gaps in their investigation. The suspect's father recalled his son's childhood fascination with how things worked, but expressed shock at his alleged involvement in such a destructive act.</p>

While NATO officials say this buildup is not on the scale of the pre-invasion buildup along the Ukraine border, it still reflects Moscow's perception of a threat given Finland's recent NATO membership.

The piece calls for Western Europe to acknowledge the experiences of those who lived under Soviet rule and to develop a cultural and historical narrative that counters Russia's attempts to divide and rule.

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a deal, but train service will not resume immediately. The strike, which halted trains across New Jersey for four days, is a relief to commuters who rely on the system to travel to New York City and Philadelphia. NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri said the deal is fair and fiscally responsible, reflecting concessions made by way of a work rule. Full service is expected to restart on Tuesday, with Monday used to preposition equipment and conduct safety checks.</p>
