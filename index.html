          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm made a deal with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The agreement involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono services. The president's initial executive order criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz and for taking on a pro bono case related to the January 6 Capitol riot. Other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional.
