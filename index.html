          <p>WhatsApp is facing criticism for its new AI feature, Meta AI, which is integrated into the messaging service and cannot be turned off, despite being labeled as "optional." The company defends the feature, stating they are always listening to user feedback. Concerns have been raised about potential privacy violations, with critics arguing that Meta is exploiting its market position and using users as test subjects for AI. Experts warn users to be cautious about sharing sensitive information with Meta AI, as it could be used by the company.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses potential solutions to the issue of illegal immigration in the United States, focusing on financial disincentives for employers who hire undocumented workers and the elimination of federal benefits for those residing in the country illegally. The author argues that while courts may impede deportation efforts, economic measures can discourage illegal immigration by making it unsustainable. The piece suggests implementing substantial fines for companies or individuals who knowingly or unknowingly employ undocumented immigrants and advocates for ending all federal benefits for this population.

          <p>A 19-year-old U.S. citizen with intellectual disabilities was detained by Customs and Border Protection agents in Arizona for 10 days, sparking controversy and raising questions about due process. The Department of Homeland Security initially defended the arrest, stating that the individual claimed to be a Mexican citizen who had entered the U.S. illegally. However, the family provided documentation proving his American citizenship and asserted that he could not understand the implications of his statements due to his disabilities. The case has drawn attention from Arizona's Attorney General, who is investigating the matter.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges, including a 71% drop in profits, leading to a shift in Elon Musk's priorities. Musk is reducing his involvement with DOGE to refocus on Tesla, acknowledging the impact of protests and declining sales, particularly among left-leaning EV enthusiasts. The company faces increasing competition, especially in China, and must address its brand's toxicity to regain market share. Tesla's future hinges on its ability to innovate and compete in an increasingly crowded EV market.</p>

The reductions are partly due to a decision by the US State Department to decrease funding, combined with increased refugee numbers and economic pressures.
