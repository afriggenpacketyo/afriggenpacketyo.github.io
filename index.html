          <p>American Express and JPMorgan Chase are preparing to refresh their premium credit cards, Platinum and Sapphire Reserve, respectively, intensifying the competition in the luxury credit card market. JPMorgan Chase announced an imminent refresh of its Sapphire Reserve card, prompting American Express to respond with plans for significant changes to its Platinum cards later in the year, representing their largest investment in a card refresh. Both companies are expected to enhance travel, dining, and experience perks, potentially increasing annual fees, and these changes are in line with recent trends in the premium credit card sector, as both companies aim to attract and retain affluent customers with enhanced benefits and rewards programs. The Platinum card currently has a $695 annual fee, while the Sapphire Reserve card has a $550 annual fee, and JPMorgan declined to comment on rumors that they would raise their fee to $795. </p>

          <p>At least 34 Palestinians were killed in shootings near food distribution centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the southern Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. Witnesses claim Israeli troops opened fire to control crowds attempting to reach the food hubs, while the Israeli military stated troops fired warning shots at individuals approaching their positions. The GHF system, backed by the U.S. and Israel, aims to prevent Hamas from diverting aid, but U.N. agencies and major aid groups have rejected the system, stating it is insufficient and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, criticized the GHF as a "lethal distribution system," highlighting the ongoing tragedies in Gaza.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is launching three new ad features in a global rollout across the messaging app, and these ads will not appear within private chats, nor will message contents be used to determine ad displays. Instead, WhatsApp will use user country, city, language, ad interaction, and channel subscriptions to suggest content, and those who have linked their WhatsApp account to Facebook or Instagram will see more personalized ads. The new ads will appear in a separate "Updates" tab, and businesses with channels can promote ads to attract followers and charge for exclusive content, with WhatsApp taking a 10% commission. Meta is aiming to monetize WhatsApp at scale, but any perception of the app becoming too noisy or Facebook-ified could spark backlash.</p>

          <p>Meta is introducing ads to WhatsApp, marking a significant shift for the app that has historically shunned advertising, and businesses will be able to run status ads that prompt users to interact via messaging features. Meta will also monetize WhatsApp's Channels feature through search ads and subscriptions, representing a major step in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to make WhatsApp a core part of Meta's business. The company will use basic information to recommend ads, including country, city, device, language, and data on user interactions, and the new ads will be limited to WhatsApp's Updates tab to minimize disruption.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pushing for benefits reform, aiming to cut the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 2030, including changes to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) eligibility. Dozens of Labour MPs have expressed concerns about the plans, but Starmer insists the reforms are necessary, as the current system is not working for those needing support or taxpayers. The proposals include scrapping the work capability assessment and tightening Pip eligibility, but the government wants more frequent reassessments for many Pip claimants, and up to 1.3 million people could lose some support under the changes.</p>

The article also highlights the success of the Energy Star program, which certifies energy-efficient appliances and saves Americans billions of dollars annually, and ending the program could lead to higher electricity bills and hinder the nation's competitiveness in technology.</p>
