          <p>Authorities are conducting an intensive manhunt for the individual responsible for the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The FBI has identified a person of interest, releasing multiple images, and recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle believed to be the weapon used in the targeted attack. Investigators are analyzing forensic evidence, including palm prints and shoe impressions, while processing over 7,000 leads and conducting nearly 200 interviews. The suspect, described as college-aged, was seen fleeing the campus, and Utah's governor has vowed to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Adobe announced impressive fiscal third-quarter results, surpassing analysts' estimates for both earnings and revenue, which propelled its stock higher in extended trading. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.31 and revenue of $5.99 billion, demonstrating 11% year-over-year growth. Adobe also provided optimistic guidance for the fourth quarter, projecting adjusted earnings between $5.35 and $5.40 per share, above average estimates. This positive performance is largely attributed to the successful integration of artificial intelligence throughout its product portfolio, with AI-influenced annualized recurring revenue now exceeding $5 billion.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticized the conviction of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as a "witch hunt" and indicated the U.S. would "respond accordingly," following Bolsonaro's 27-year prison sentence for a coup plot. This diplomatic tension escalates after the U.S. sanctioned Brazilian Justice Alexandre de Moraes and President Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, which Brazil's President Lula da Silva condemned as an attack on sovereignty. The Brazilian leader vowed retaliation against any unilateral tariff increases, citing a U.S. trade surplus with Brazil over the past 15 years. Analysts suggest U.S.-Brazil relations are at a decades-low point and are likely to deteriorate further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SK Hynix shares soared to a 25-year high following the company's announcement of completing development for HBM4, the next-generation high-bandwidth memory essential for artificial intelligence. This significant technological breakthrough boosted investor confidence, contributing to a broader rally across Asian markets, which mirrored Wall Street's gains. The positive market sentiment is largely driven by expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts and easing inflation pressures, despite a recent CPI reading that was slightly above forecasts. This indicates a strong belief in the tech industry's growth trajectory and the potential for continued market expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, China's foreign ministry defended its actions as sovereign efforts to maintain ecological stability and sustainability, urging the Philippines to halt what it described as "infringing and provocative actions" to avoid further escalating maritime tensions in the disputed waters.</p>

Key strategies include giving children autonomy in food choices, avoiding the labeling of foods as "good" or "bad" to promote a balanced relationship with eating, and making mealtimes an enjoyable experience away from food pressure. Additionally, parents are advised to recognize natural appetite fluctuations and involve children in food preparation to enhance familiarity and acceptance of diverse foods.</p>

          <p>NATO members are bolstering defenses along the eastern flank after an unprecedented Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, which saw three drones shot down. Poland has called for a UN Security Council session and is receiving commitments for troops, artillery, and air defense systems from allies including the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Germany, and France. While U.S. President Donald Trump suggested the incident could have been a "mistake," many European and Polish leaders view it as a deliberate provocation intended to test NATO's capabilities. This article, coupled with impending joint Belarus-Russia military exercises, has intensified regional anxieties, leading to border restrictions and calls for a unified European air shield.</p>

          <p>An industrial street in downtown Los Angeles, Naomi Avenue, has transformed into an illegal dumping ground for rotting produce, fostering a severe public health and sanitation problem. Local business owners and residents report that trucks consistently discard spoiled fruits and vegetables, resulting in pervasive putrid odors and attracting "extra large" and "deformed" rats. Despite years of reporting the issue to city officials through the MyLA311 app, responses have been slow and inadequate, frustrating residents who properly manage their waste. The problem underscores significant challenges in urban waste management and the detrimental impact of illegal dumping on the quality of life for the community, including those living in makeshift shelters nearby.</p>

          <p>Many Americans are encountering significant barriers to receiving updated COVID-19 vaccines due to new FDA guidelines that primarily restrict eligibility to individuals aged 65 and older or those with specific high-risk health conditions. This shift from previous universal access means numerous healthy, younger individuals, or those seeking to protect at-risk family members, are being denied vaccinations at pharmacies. Contributing to the difficulty are pharmacists' confusion over the new rules, delays in CDC recommendations, and potential complexities with insurance coverage. While the Trump administration's health officials argue broad immunity exists, independent medical organizations maintain that everyone should have the option to be vaccinated.</p>

The court has suspended the current Births and Deaths Registration Act for two years, mandating government amendment.

Kirk, the 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA and a staunch ally of Donald Trump, was renowned for his campus debates and promotion of conservative Christian ideals. His assassination has sparked widespread shock and grief, while simultaneously exposing profound political polarizations, with President Trump attributing the violence to the "radical left."</p>

The new rule specifically targets sub-Cabinet, ambassador, and executive branch nominees, excluding judicial appointments.
