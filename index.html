          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction that would have allowed USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson to play in the upcoming football season. The players sued the NCAA, arguing its 'Five-Year Rule' violates antitrust laws by limiting their eligibility and potential to earn NIL compensation. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny. This decision deals a significant blow to both teams, as the players were expected to hold key roles, and it highlights the ongoing legal inconsistencies in challenges against NCAA regulations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is projected to move up the Atlantic Ocean without making direct landfall in the United States. Despite remaining offshore, the powerful Category 3 storm is expected to generate life-threatening surf conditions and dangerous rip currents along the entire East Coast for much of the week. Officials in North Carolina's Outer Banks have issued evacuation orders and storm surge watches due to the risk of significant coastal flooding. The storm's development aligns with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Colorado Rockies 4-3 after a walk-off single in the ninth inning at Coors Field. Despite twice holding the lead, the Dodgers' bullpen could not secure the win, with the deciding run scoring after a fielding miscommunication led to a double. Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a strong performance over seven innings, but the team's offense was unable to capitalize fully. The loss marks the Rockies' first victory against the Dodgers this season, breaking an extended losing streak against their division rival.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has handed a partial victory to the Trump administration and Florida in a lawsuit over an immigrant detention center in the Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The judge dismissed a claim regarding unclear court jurisdiction as moot, since the government has now designated a specific court for the detainees' cases. However, claims alleging that the government is violating the First Amendment by impeding confidential access between detainees and their lawyers will proceed. The case concerning legal access has been transferred to a different federal court, while a separate lawsuit challenging the facility on environmental grounds is still pending.</p>

Four masked individuals smashed their way into Menashe & Sons Jewelers, threatening staff and clearing display cases in under 90 seconds. A police source confirmed Chief Barnes and his plainclothes security detail were inside a nearby business and were unaware of the crime until emergency vehicles responded. No arrests have been made, and the swift, high-value heist has intensified concerns about public safety in the area.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted to achieve this goal. During a White House meeting, Trump asserted that mail-in ballots are inherently corrupt and claimed the federal government has the authority to dictate election procedures to the states. However, Article I of the U.S. Constitution grants states the primary authority to regulate elections, a power that can only be altered by Congress, not the president. This move is part of the president's ongoing efforts to reshape election laws, despite widespread use of mail-in voting.</p>

The documents detail multiple complaints about his conduct, including physically blocking women in an office and showing a discomfiting academic interest in sexual burglary.

These exports now total approximately $1.6 trillion, substantially more than the combined $1 trillion exported to the United States and Western Europe. The trend indicates a strategic pivot by Chinese firms to mitigate risks from U.S. tariffs and a slowing domestic economy. This shift is reshaping global commerce, potentially making South-South trade a new center of economic gravity with Chinese multinationals as dominant players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a tense summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska and subsequent meetings with European leaders in Washington, President Trump's diplomatic efforts on the Ukraine war appear to have stalled. While European leaders successfully steered Trump away from immediately endorsing a land-for-peace deal, the new plan involves arranging a direct meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, which has little chance of success without prior agreements. This approach effectively delays substantive action, such as new sanctions or arms shipments, which benefits Putin by allowing him to continue his military campaign. The article suggests that despite the flurry of activity, no meaningful progress towards peace has been made.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department for tying federal crime victim grants to immigration enforcement cooperation. The suit argues that new rules requiring grant recipients to assist federal immigration agents are illegal and unconstitutional. The states contend that this policy forces them to choose between forfeiting critical funding for services like emergency shelters and crisis hotlines, or being conscripted into federal immigration enforcement. This legal challenge is the latest battle between the Trump administration and so-called 'sanctuary' jurisdictions over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new large-scale migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. The facility, which can eventually hold up to 5,000 people, is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to increase detention capacity for mass deportations. Critics, including Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar, argue the funds could be better spent on community services and that the center lacks sufficient legal access for detainees. Administration officials defend the facility, stating it offers all necessary services and is intended for individuals with no legal right to be in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to geographically realign the sport, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that grouping teams by region into Eastern and Western conferences could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason television schedules. While such a move would likely face resistance from traditionalists, it could foster stronger regional rivalries. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process, with Nashville and Salt Lake City as potential locations, approved by 2029.</p>

          <p>An international research team is studying sediment cores drilled from the Antarctic seabed to understand centuries of climate and ocean history. By analyzing the layered mud, scientists can reconstruct past marine life, measure historical pollution levels, and calculate the amount of carbon buried on the seafloor. A key focus is using environmental DNA to assess the impact of industrial whaling, which removed vast numbers of whales from the Southern Ocean. This research aims to quantify how much carbon these large animals sequester, providing crucial data on the ocean's role in regulating the global climate.</p>

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a massive 113-year-old wooden church is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5km away. The relocation is necessary because over a century of iron ore mining has caused ground subsidence, threatening the old city center. The 672-tonne church has been lifted onto giant transporters for the two-day journey. This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to move the city's key buildings to safer ground, a process funded by the mining company. For residents, the event is an emotional moment, representing the preservation of their community's history.</p>

After a more balanced second half, a disputed handball decision against Everton's James Tarkowski led to the decisive goal. The win provides a crucial and optimistic start for Leeds in their campaign to remain in the top flight, while Everton's lackluster performance highlighted potential weaknesses early in the season.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called 'designer Xanax.' This action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to combat its distribution. The move was prompted by Kentucky's attorney general, who is also leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the federal DEA to enact a nationwide ban. The unregulated drug, linked to dozens of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year, poses a significant public health threat as it is often disguised as legitimate prescription medication.</p>
