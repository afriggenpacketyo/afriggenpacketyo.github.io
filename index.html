          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans have divided opinions on President Trump's initial 100 days in office, with his loyal base remaining supportive while others express concerns about his focus on tariffs and their impact on prices. MAGA Republicans have a more positive economic outlook, while independents, young people, and Hispanic people have become less approving. The poll also highlights differing views on immigration policies, with most Americans supporting deportation programs but disapproving of mistakenly detaining legal residents. The survey, conducted with a nationally representative sample, reveals a partisan divide in how Americans perceive the changes brought about by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's ongoing conflict with CBS News' 60 Minutes has escalated into a significant battle over media independence, sparking concerns about the erosion of press freedoms. A longtime executive producer resigned due to pressure from the parent company, Paramount, which is attempting to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with Kamala Harris. Critics argue that this capitulation sets a dangerous precedent, potentially allowing powerful individuals to influence news organizations and undermine their ability to report independently.</p>

          <p>Sidney Blumenthal argues that Donald Trump's actions demonstrate a governing philosophy centered on a ruthless quest for absolute power, disregarding traditional conservative principles. Trump's use of executive orders, attacks on the Department of Justice, and actions regarding immigration are presented as evidence of his authoritarian tendencies. The author draws parallels between Trump's approach and the legal theories of Carl Schmitt, a key figure in the Nazi regime, highlighting the potential dangers to American constitutional law and democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are expressing concerns about Donald Trump's recent order to reverse fishing regulations in the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine national monument, potentially endangering fragile ecosystems and threatened species.
