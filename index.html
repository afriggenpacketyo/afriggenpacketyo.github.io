          <h2>Indian Airlines Adjust Routes Due to Pakistan Airspace Closure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to Pakistan's airspace closure, Indian airlines are rerouting flights to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East, leading to longer and costlier journeys. Some flights may require refueling stops or cancellations, impacting IndiGo and Air India. The closure stems from escalating tensions between India and Pakistan following a tourist massacre in Jammu and Kashmir, which India attributes to Pakistani militants, a claim Pakistan denies. While the closure poses challenges, analysts suggest airfares may not significantly increase, and the impact is more symbolic than majorly disruptive. (not investment advice)</p>

Since March 2, restrictions on food, medicine, and supplies have worsened conditions for the estimated 55,000 pregnant women in Gaza. Up to 20% are malnourished, and half face high-risk pregnancies, with limited access to maternal health services and essential medicines.

          <p>Populist politics, initially appealing for their simplicity and promise of liberation, often result in increased complexity and hassle when applied to real-world problems. Brexit, for example, has led to more border controls and paperwork, while stricter immigration policies create new bureaucracies and detention facilities. Even the Trump administration, known for its populist agenda, has become increasingly interventionist and bureaucratic, attempting to micromanage various institutions. While some voters are satisfied by the challenge to elites, others may be disillusioned by the increased government intervention.</p>

Experts suggest these pouches should be used sparingly and are not replacements for homemade meals. Savory pouches, often used as meal replacements, contain less than 5% of the daily iron requirement, while some fruit pouches contain more sugar than a one-year-old should consume in a day. Some pouches are marketed to babies as young as four months old, against the recommendations of the UK government and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
