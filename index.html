          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were slated to be laid off. The injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, emphasizes the department's need to fulfill its functions and obligations mandated by Congress. This decision follows the Education Department's announcement on March 11 of a significant staff reduction. The Department of Education was established in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter and has faced multiple existential threats over the decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 4-4 decision, the Supreme Court has blocked a plan to allow Oklahoma to use public funds for a Catholic charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, leading to the tie. The deadlock upholds the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling against the school, which aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. This decision means that the long-standing guarantee of secular public schools remains in effect, but the future of religious charter schools remains uncertain as proponents may attempt to establish such schools in a way that does not require Justice Barrett's recusal.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist detained in Louisiana, met his month-old son for the first time before an immigration court hearing. The Trump administration seeks to deport Khalil, arguing his presence promotes antisemitism, despite his lawyers' claims he has spoken against it. Khalil's lawyers are challenging the deportation, citing danger he would face if deported to Syria or Algeria, and arguing his arrest was warrantless. The case has sparked concerns about free speech and due process, with a federal judge in New Jersey considering whether Khalil can be released on bail.</p>

          <p>Two Native American tribes have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government over the Indian boarding school system, alleging treaty violations and demanding compensation for abuses and financial mismanagement. The lawsuit, brought by the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes of Oklahoma, claims the government forcibly separated Native children from their families, suppressed their culture, and subjected them to abuse. The tribes seek a full accounting of the $23 billion spent on running the schools and reparations for the harm caused. The lawsuit aims to hold the government accountable for the historical injustices inflicted on Native communities.</p>

          <p>In a poignant essay, the author reflects on the simultaneous experiences of his mother's death and the destruction caused by a tornado.

The revisions follow industry lobbying, citing potential cost increases for taxpayers.
