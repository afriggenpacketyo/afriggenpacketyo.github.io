          <p>This CBS News article advises borrowers to carefully consider their options before pursuing debt forgiveness. It suggests asking if they meet the requirements, have considered other debt relief options like debt management plans or debt consolidation, and need expert help with negotiations. Debt forgiveness can offer relief but carries risks such as credit score damage and tax implications. The article emphasizes evaluating qualifications, exploring alternatives, and assessing the need for professional assistance before committing to debt forgiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that the U.S. job market remained healthy in April, with employers adding 177,000 jobs and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. This is reassuring to investors worried about a trade-induced economic slowdown. However, the article notes that the full impact of President Trump's tariffs on the labor market will be felt in the coming months, with potential risks to consumer sentiment and business investment. Several companies have already pulled their forecasts for the rest of the year due to trade uncertainty, and consumer sentiment has plunged. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that Mike Waltz was offered several ambassadorships, including Saudi Arabia, before accepting the U.N. ambassador post.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio transitions into dual roles as interim national security adviser and America's top diplomat. The Trump administration considers the Saudi Arabia post a consequential one and aims to include Saudi Arabia in the Abraham Accords.</p>

Net sales and adjusted earnings per share exceeded estimates. The company's plan to break itself up has sweetened the fundamental investment case. Despite concerns about tariffs and China exposure, the electronics business continues to perform well, and the company is working to mitigate tariff costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>DW reports that press freedom in Turkey has been under pressure for years, with journalists not only being imprisoned but also subjected to judicial measures long before a verdict has been reached. Restrictions such as house arrest, bans on leaving the country, and reporting obligations are increasingly used to silence critical voices. This practice is seen as a direct attack on the right to free reporting and a curtailing of the population's ability to inform itself freely.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports on how China could retaliate against U.S. tariffs, including using its financial power and control over rare earth elements. Since 2018, China has developed regulatory tools, including export controls, that could be used to pressure U.S. businesses. As tariff rates rose this spring, ports on the U.S. West Coast reported a slowdown in activity. China's leaders have urged nations to stand up to what they call "unilateral bullying" from the United States.</p>
