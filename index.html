        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Civil servants across China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent, locally-imposed austerity measures that often exceed central government regulations. This trend, described by one official as "ceng ceng jia ma" or adding extra layers of control, reflects a cautious approach to public spending and personal conduct among government employees. An official in Sichuan province noted his department head implemented a ban on eating out to avoid negative perceptions during a sensitive period. The shift in behavior is a direct response to the evolving and often unpredictable enforcement of anti-corruption and austerity campaigns at the local level.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major domestic policy and spending package has advanced in the U.S. Senate after clearing a crucial procedural hurdle with a narrow 51-49 vote. The passage followed intense last-minute negotiations, with three Republican holdouts eventually voting in favor, allowing the measure to proceed without the need for a tie-breaking vote. Democrats are now employing delay tactics, forcing a full reading of the 940-page bill on the Senate floor, a process that could take many hours. The legislation still faces a final vote in the Senate and must be passed again by the narrowly-divided House, indicating a challenging path ahead.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued recovery on the mound by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, a 101.7 mph fastball, and allowed only one hit and one walk while striking out one batter. Despite his strong pitching performance in his third start since returning from elbow surgery, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats at the plate. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak in a contest where their offense struggled to keep pace.</p>

          <p>A wildfire, dubbed the Lake fire, rapidly grew to 477 acres near the Silverwood Lake State Recreation Area in San Bernardino County, prompting mandatory evacuations and road closures. The blaze, which broke out late Saturday afternoon, produced flames as high as 100 feet, forcing over 100 people at the reservoir to flee, with some being evacuated from the beach by boaters. Evacuation orders are in effect for areas south of Highway 138, while warnings are in place for regions to the north.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted to begin debate on President Trump's signature domestic policy package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after a tense and prolonged session. The procedural motion passed after Senator Ron Johnson switched his vote to yes, securing the necessary majority for Republicans and avoiding a tie-breaker. Following the vote, Democrats initiated a filibuster tactic by requesting the entire 1,000-page bill be read aloud, a process estimated to take over 15 hours. The article also notes a separate legal setback for the administration, as a federal judge permanently blocked an executive order targeting a law firm that represented the president's political opponents.</p>

          <p>The Leadmill, a legendary music venue in Sheffield, has closed its doors after 45 years following a prolonged dispute with its landlords, the Electric Group. The venue, which hosted iconic bands like Pulp, Arctic Monkeys, and Oasis, is deeply ingrained in the city's cultural history. Musicians such as Richard Hawley, who compared it to Liverpool's Cavern Club, have lamented the closure, with Hawley vowing not to perform there under new management. While the new owners state it will remain a music venue, fans and staff express sorrow over losing a grassroots institution that served as a vital hub for emerging artists and the local community.</p>

The jury also found true a hate crime enhancement, agreeing with prosecutors that Woodward, who was linked to an extremist neo-Nazi group, targeted Bernstein for being gay and Jewish. This conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, bringing a long-awaited sense of justice to Bernstein's family.

          <p>The UK government is launching a new initiative partnering with major supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier consumer choices and combat rising obesity rates. Under the plan, food retailers will voluntarily report on their sales of healthy food and are encouraged to use strategies like promotions, loyalty point incentives, and store layout changes to make nutritious options more appealing. The policy is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan aimed at making the current generation of children the healthiest ever. Critics note that while welcome, the voluntary nature of the scheme and its focus on major retailers may limit its overall impact on public health.</p>

          <p>The rising popularity of "Love Island USA" has been accompanied by intense cyberbullying of its contestants, prompting the show to issue a plea for viewers to stop the harassment. This situation reflects a long-standing issue within the reality TV franchise, as the UK version has been linked to the suicides of two former contestants, leading to a government inquiry. While producers have implemented more robust mental health support, including on-site psychologists, experts argue the fundamental nature of such shows creates a difficult balance. The intense scrutiny and fleeting nature of overnight fame pose significant risks to participants' well-being, a lesson the US spinoff is now learning.</p>

Without naming individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to condemn statements from both President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. Roberts emphasized that impeachment and threats are not appropriate responses to judicial decisions, for which the appellate process exists.</p>

This reignites a recent feud between the tech CEO and the administration, which had previously seen Trump threaten to review federal subsidies for Musk's companies.

President Vucic has accused the protesters of being part of a foreign plot and has so far refused calls for a snap election.

According to US firm REalloys, building out this new capacity will be a costly and lengthy process due to significant technical hurdles. Analysts suggest that government subsidies and tariffs may be necessary to make these new overseas projects financially viable and competitive against Chinese products. REalloys is planning a US$50 million facility to process ore sourced from Brazil in Canada as part of this strategic shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Explaining the Urban Heat Island Effect as Cities Face Rising Temperatures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As heatwaves become more frequent and intense, the 'urban heat island' effect explains why cities are often significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and store the sun's energy, releasing it slowly and raising temperatures, particularly at night. This phenomenon, compounded by waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, can make city centers 4-6Â°C warmer than the countryside. With over half the world's population living in urban areas, this effect leaves a growing number of people vulnerable to heat-related health risks and highlights the need for urban planning that incorporates more cooling green spaces and water sources.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez in Venice has sparked protests from local residents and activists. Hundreds marched through the city's streets with banners like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," criticizing the event as an exploitation of Venice while its citizens struggle with overtourism, high housing costs, and environmental threats. Protesters argue that the billionaire's presence and the influx of celebrity guests highlight the city's precarious state. Despite Bezos donating to local environmental groups, many activists dismissed the gesture as an attempt to appease residents and called for a Venice dedicated to its citizens rather than wealthy tourists.</p>

          <p>Primary schools in Kent, UK, are trialing a new sun safety program to educate children as young as five on how to reduce their risk of skin cancer later in life. The initiative, which teaches pupils to check UV levels and apply sunscreen correctly, is planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, with diagnoses projected to rise in the coming years. The program, developed by the Melanoma Fund charity, aims to instill lifelong healthy habits and empower children to take responsibility for their own sun protection.</p>

Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the government and allowed the event to take place, framing it as a celebration of human rights and freedom.

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes across Gaza have killed at least 72 people, according to officials from the Hamas-run health ministry, with casualties reported in Gaza City and Khan Younis. The attacks come as President Trump stated that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could potentially be reached within the next week. Negotiations for a pause in fighting have been intermittent for months, with a recent proposal involving a 60-day ceasefire and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues, with residents facing catastrophic hunger and difficulties accessing the limited aid entering the territory.</p>

          <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona, rescued a baby who had been left alone for several days in an apartment after the infant's mother passed away. Officers were called to perform a welfare check after a neighbor reported not having heard from the woman, who had recently given birth. Upon forcing entry, they found the mother deceased and the baby on a bed in a visibly emaciated condition. The child was immediately transported to a hospital for lifesaving medical care and is now expected to make a full recovery. The cause of the mother's death is currently under investigation by the medical examiner's office.</p>
