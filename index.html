          <p>A former Army sergeant major pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 19-year-old soldier, Jaysley Beck, who later died by suicide.  Gunner Beck had reported the assault twice, but superiors allegedly pressured her to drop the complaint. The Army's failure to report the sexual assault to the police was cited as a contributing factor to her death.  This case highlights systemic issues within the military's handling of sexual assault allegations.</p>
