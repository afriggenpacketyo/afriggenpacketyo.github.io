          <p>South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, faces indictment on charges of corruption, bribery, and stock manipulation, marking a historic legal challenge for a presidential spouse. Allegations include a stock manipulation scheme that yielded over 810 million won in illicit profits and the illegal receipt of opinion poll data and bribes from the Unification Church. These charges are part of wider investigations into her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached and arrested for a short-lived martial law declaration. The ongoing probes underscore a period of significant political and legal turmoil in the nation, with several high-ranking officials also facing charges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed low-value imports under $800 to bypass tariffs, has officially concluded. President Trump enacted this change to close a perceived "catastrophic loophole" that allegedly facilitated tariff evasion and the entry of dangerous goods, including narcotics. This policy shift, initially targeting shipments from China and Hong Kong, now applies globally, with the administration expecting to generate up to $10 billion in annual tariff revenues. A six-month transition period is in place, during which postal services can opt for a flat duty per package, before full ad valorem duty collection based on shipment value becomes mandatory by February 2026.</p>

          <p>Famed Australian crocodile wrangler Matt Wright has been convicted on two counts of perverting the course of justice, including allegations of lying to police and coercing an injured witness. These charges relate to a fatal 2022 helicopter crash that tragically killed his friend and co-star, Chris "Willow" Wilson, during a crocodile egg harvesting expedition. Prosecutors contended that Wright attempted to manipulate evidence, particularly concerning the helicopter's fuel status and flight records, to avoid culpability. Despite his guilty verdict, Wright maintains his innocence and intends to appeal the decision, having been released on bail pending further legal proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK businesses are expressing significant alarm and uncertainty regarding the new U.S. tariffs on low-value parcels, which have eliminated the "de minimis" exemption for goods under $800. This policy change, effective from Friday, is expected to substantially increase costs and create new barriers for small firms attempting to export to the American market. Many companies, like Helen Hickman's hand-dyed wool business, have already paused U.S. shipments due to the inability to provide customers with accurate upfront costs. The Federation of Small Businesses is urging the UK government to offer more support, as businesses grapple with the impact on their sales and supply chains.</p>

          <p>Russian missile strikes on Kyiv have resulted in the deaths of at least 23 people, including four children, and caused damage to the European Union's delegation office, igniting widespread outrage among European leaders. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, condemned the attack, noting missiles landed perilously close to the EU premises. This bombardment, described as the largest assault on the Ukrainian capital this month, occurred shortly after a U.S.-led diplomatic initiative aimed at peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has renewed his call for stringent sanctions against Russia, while European officials are summoning Russian ambassadors in protest of the escalating aggression.</p>

          <p>Cambricon, a prominent Chinese chipmaker often referred to as "little Nvidia," has issued a cautionary statement to investors, highlighting significant risks after its Shanghai-listed stock experienced an extraordinary 533% gain over the past year. The company explicitly warned that its stock price might be detached from its underlying fundamentals, potentially exposing investors to considerable risks. This surge is largely attributed to China's supportive policies for domestic artificial intelligence chips and the emergence of new AI models. Furthermore, Cambricon reminded its stakeholders that it remains vulnerable to U.S. export restrictions, which present ongoing supply chain challenges and could negatively impact its operational performance.

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, appointed by President Trump, has lodged a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook. This latest referral alleges that Cook made misrepresentations concerning the mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and two other properties in her government ethics filings. Pulte's actions are part of President Trump's efforts to remove Cook from the Fed board, referencing a prior criminal referral related to purported false claims on mortgage applications. In response, Cook has initiated a lawsuit against Trump, seeking to block her unprecedented removal from the central bank.</p>

          <p>Officials report that Robin Westman, the attacker responsible for killing two children and injuring 18 others at a Minneapolis church school, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children" and harbored widespread hatred. The 23-year-old assailant, who had previously attended the school, left a note, though a clear motive remains elusive. Investigators confirmed Westman expressed extreme anti-religious views and animosity towards the Jewish community and President Trump, with such sentiments inscribed on firearms. Despite the legally purchased weapons and no prior watchlist appearances, the church's locked doors are credited with preventing further casualties in this tragic incident.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing Kilmar Abrego Garcia have petitioned a federal judge to impose a gag order on senior Trump administration officials, including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi. This request aims to prevent them from issuing "baseless public attacks" against their client, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and now faces criminal charges and potential deportation to Uganda. Abrego Garcia's attorneys contend that the officials' inflammatory public statements, which include accusations of gang membership and child predation, are highly prejudicial and threaten his right to a fair trial. A Maryland judge has temporarily halted his deportation to allow for further review of his case.</p>

          <p>Four senior officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resigned, expressing profound concerns over escalating political interference in the agency's scientific integrity, especially regarding vaccine policies. These high-profile departures, including the Chief Medical Officer and the Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, closely followed the White House's removal of CDC Director Susan Monarez. The departing scientists articulated unease about vaccine policy decisions being made preemptively, often without adequate scientific data, and cited instances where evidence reviews were reportedly altered or withdrawn. They characterized their collective resignation as a "bat signal" to alert the public to the perceived "weaponization" of public health.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is set to rule on the fate of suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a decision that could trigger significant political paralysis for the nation. The 39-year-old leader, who has been in office for only a year, faces accusations of ethical misconduct and undermining the military, specifically tied to a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. Should the court remove her, she would become the fifth prime minister in 17 years to be ousted by the Constitutional Court, underscoring Thailand's enduring political instability. This critical judgment also unfolds just weeks after a fragile ceasefire with Cambodia following deadly border clashes.</p>
