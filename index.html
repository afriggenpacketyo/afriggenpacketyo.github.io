          <p>Selma Blair has announced that she is "truly relapse-free" from multiple sclerosis after battling the disease for seven years, which she was first diagnosed with in 2018. The actress shared that she has been feeling great for about a year, and her stamina and energy have improved significantly. Blair is now focusing on her future dreams, including a return to acting with three upcoming movies and plans to write a young adult fantasy book. She will also continue advocating for people with chronic illnesses and raising awareness about MS, having been in remission since 2021 after undergoing stem cell transplantation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, in collaboration with state law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 immigrants in Florida this week. The operation targeted undocumented immigrants with final deportation orders, with over 275 migrants picked up who had already received such orders. This action marks the latest effort by the Trump administration to accelerate deportations of undocumented immigrants, which have thus far fallen short of the administration’s stated goals. This Florida operation was the first conducted under a formal agreement with state law enforcement known as a 287(g) agreement.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and their families gathered to commemorate the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp where tens of thousands died. British and Canadian troops entered the camp in April 1945, discovering 13,000 unburied corpses and 60,000 emaciated survivors. Belsen's notoriety stemmed from its intact state upon liberation, with huts, barracks, and witnesses still present, unlike other camps destroyed by the Germans. Overcrowding and inhumane conditions led to the deaths of between 50,000 and 70,000 people, primarily Jews, in the final months of the war.</p>

          <p>Australia's universal healthcare system, once revered, is facing a crisis due to inadequate government funding, worker shortages, and rising costs for patients. Wait times are increasing, and doctors are beginning to charge gap fees, leading more Australians to delay or forgo necessary care. Health has become a key issue for voters in the upcoming election, with both major parties promising additional funding. However, experts argue that sweeping changes to the funding model are needed to save the system.</p>

          <p>Wrexham's co-chairmen, McElhenney and Reynolds, aim to establish the club as a Premier League team with increased attendance and improved facilities, while making a positive impact on the community. The club is preparing for its first season in the Championship since 1981-82, with plans to expand the squad, improve the stadium, and develop a training ground. While the challenge of the Championship is significant, Wrexham's impressive revenue and strong alignment from top to bottom position them well for future success.</p>

          <p>The Gran Abuelo, an approximately 5,400-year-old tree in a Chilean rainforest, is threatened by a proposed highway that would cut through a protected national park. Scientists warn that the road would increase the risk of wildfires and disrupt the ecosystem, potentially endangering the alerce trees, an endangered species. Researchers are using the Gran Abuelo to reconstruct climate patterns stretching back thousands of years, data unmatched by any other species in the region, making its preservation critical for understanding climate change.</p>
