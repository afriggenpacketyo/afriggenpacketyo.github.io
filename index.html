            <p>The leaders of Canada's major federal parties engaged in a debate dominated by discussions of trade relations with the US under President Trump, as well as domestic issues such as affordability and crime. Liberal leader Mark Carney faced criticism for his association with former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, while defending his distinct approach to governance. The debate highlighted differing policy visions, with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre advocating for smaller government and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh pushing for stronger social programs. Smaller parties like the Bloc Quebecois fought for relevance, emphasizing regional interests and the need for checks on the governing party.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, despite court orders for his return. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to release Abrego Garcia, despite the US request, and the White House continues to allege ties between Abrego Garcia and MS-13, which his lawyers deny. Van Hollen's visit aims to signal continued efforts to secure Abrego Garcia's return to the US, amidst a legal battle involving the Alien Enemies Act and concerns over due process for migrants.</p>

            <p>The global economy is facing challenges due to the escalating trade war and policy changes driven by the US administration, particularly tariffs. While some view tariffs as a tactic to address trade imbalances, they impose costs on businesses and consumers. The lack of a clear international response to the US policies is concerning, raising questions about fear, complacency, or a lack of alternatives. The potential for the US to reverse globalization and reshore manufacturing jobs would require significant investment and could lead to inflation.</p>

            <p>A wind project off the coast of Long Island has been halted by order of the Secretary of the Interior, raising concerns about the future of the offshore wind industry. The project, called Empire Wind 1, had already received federal permits and broken ground, but the Trump administration has expressed opposition to offshore wind development. Critics argue that the decision was not based on evidence and threatens clean-energy growth, union jobs, and New York's renewable energy goals. The halting of Empire Wind 1 could have broader implications for the clean-energy industry beyond offshore wind.</p>

            <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents, was postponed due to disputes between attorneys and prosecutors. The hearing was meant to determine if the brothers, serving life without parole, would receive a new sentence potentially allowing their release. The delay stems from requests to recuse the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and review a new report on the brothers' potential danger to the public. The resentencing bid is one of several legal avenues the brothers are pursuing for a possible future release.</p>

            <p>A pilot project called SeaCURE has begun operating in the UK to explore the feasibility of removing carbon from seawater. The project processes seawater to extract carbon dioxide before returning the water to the ocean, where it absorbs more CO2 from the atmosphere. SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 bn tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed. The project is one of 15 being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.</p>

            <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to cut interest rates and expressing impatience for Powell's term to end. Trump's comments followed Powell's warning about the potential consequences of the administration's trade war. Trump pointed to the European Central Bank's rate cuts and claimed the US was getting rich on tariffs. The president also stated that if asked, Powell would leave.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University, with President Trump calling for the revocation of its tax-exempt status. The IRS is reportedly planning to enact the president’s demand, a move that would cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. The move is part of an ongoing battle, and a significant escalation on Trump’s attack on Harvard and his aggressive, multi-pronged assault on higher education institutions. The White has urged Harvard to change its hiring, teaching and admissions practices to help fight antisemitism on campus.</p>

            <p>Canada is facing a housing affordability crisis, with home prices in major cities like Vancouver and Toronto far exceeding average household incomes. The crisis is driven by a supply shortage, zoning laws, and the wealth generated by older homeowners. Political parties are proposing solutions such as increasing housing construction, but some argue that these measures may not be enough. The federal government has an ability to "lead persuasively" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country.</p>

            <p>The CDC has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools due to potential layoffs among staff working on the agency's response to the outbreak. A CDC employee, Dylan Neu, stated that the decision was made due to concerns about his potential layoff while in the field. The layoffs have impacted other work done by NIOSH, such as health hazard evaluations, and the CDC is struggling to find resources to support states facing outbreaks.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike over the removal of the Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO) role, which would result in pay cuts for some workers. The union claims some workers could face pay cuts of up to £8,000, while the council estimates the maximum loss to be just over £6,000. The council claims that the higher-paid role could open up the council to more equal pay claims as refuse collection is a job overwhelmingly performed by men. A consultation on plans for compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff began on 3 April.</p>
