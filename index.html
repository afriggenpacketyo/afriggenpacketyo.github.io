        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has escalated a political conflict by filing a lawsuit to remove Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office. Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" in a walkout where over 50 Democratic lawmakers fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-drawn congressional map. The lawsuit argues that leaving the state constitutes an abandonment of public duty, justifying removal. This legal action represents a significant escalation from the governor's previous order to have the absent lawmakers arrested and returned to the state capitol.</p>

          <p>As Japan marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings, the number of living survivors, or "hibakusha," is rapidly declining, with their average age now over 86. To ensure their firsthand accounts are not lost, a new generation of Japanese citizens is actively working to preserve and share these painful histories. This article highlights individuals like 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, who guides foreign tourists in Hiroshima, sharing his great-grandmother's story to convey the human cost of nuclear weapons. These efforts aim to transform the tragic past into a powerful, enduring message for global peace and nuclear disarmament.</p>

Kennedy, a noted vaccine critic, stated the decision was based on a review concluding that the technology's risks outweigh its benefits for these viruses. The move, impacting major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna, has drawn sharp criticism from health experts who credit mRNA technology with saving millions of lives and warn this decision could hamper future pandemic preparedness.</p>

          <p>In an escalating political showdown, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. The Democrats' departure broke the legislative quorum needed to pass the bill, which would create five new GOP-leaning districts. While Abbott directed state authorities to arrest and return the lawmakers, their jurisdiction does not extend beyond Texas. This move follows a similar quorum break in 2021 and highlights the intense partisan battle over electoral maps in the state.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by the fall of 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state approximately $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will not release inmates early but will transfer them to other prisons. The site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, may be repurposed, with local officials hopeful it could be restored to its historic form.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The House Oversight Committee, led by Republican James Comer, is seeking information regarding Epstein's activities and connections. The move comes after the Trump administration decided against releasing more federal files on Epstein, prompting bipartisan action from the committee. The subpoenas also target former attorneys general and FBI directors, signaling a broad effort to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the case over many years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California for allegedly orchestrating an illegal scheme to ship millions of dollars' worth of advanced AI chips to China. The individuals are accused of exporting sensitive technology, including Nvidia's powerful H100 GPUs, without the required licenses, thereby violating U.S. export controls designed to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors. According to the complaint, the defendants used their company to ship the components through intermediaries in Malaysia and Singapore to conceal their final destination.

Scientists warn that the reef is approaching a critical tipping point where it may not be able to recover between catastrophic events. This unprecedented decline highlights the severe impact of climate change on one of the world's most vital marine ecosystems.</p>

However, other experts express skepticism, questioning the operational feasibility of such metrics as official policy goals.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new ordinance requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. This measure aims to protect vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law, which takes effect next month but will not be enforced until 2027, applies to both new and old buildings. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, positioning the ordinance as a necessary public health protection.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has weighed in on the contentious redistricting battle in Texas, stating that the Republican party is "entitled to five more seats" in the state. His comments came as Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to block a vote on a new congressional map drawn by Republicans. Trump's declaration that his high vote count in Texas justifies the new seats adds a federal dimension to the state-level political fight. The situation has prompted threats of retaliatory redistricting from Democrats in other states, signaling a potentially prolonged and bitter national struggle over electoral boundaries.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has concluded its investigation into Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, finding no evidence of widespread bullying or misogyny as alleged by whistleblowers. However, the regulator criticized all parties involved for allowing a boardroom dispute to damage the charity's reputation publicly. The conflict, which led to Prince Harry's resignation, centered on disagreements over leadership and fundraising. While the current chair will remain, the commission has mandated an action plan to fix governance weaknesses, marking a mixed outcome for the charity and its departed founder.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court found that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This directive effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims at the border, lifting a policy the administration credited with a sharp drop in illegal crossings. The Justice Department may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court to reinstate the controversial ban.</p>

Investigators found that CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, exhibited negligence and ignored multiple warnings about the vessel's safety.

          <p>In a significant legal development, U.S. federal prosecutors have decided not to pursue the death penalty against three high-profile alleged Mexican drug cartel leaders. The decision applies to Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada of the Sinaloa cartel, Rafael Caro Quintero, accused of the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, and Vicente Carrillo Fuentes of the Juárez cartel. This move is notable given the Trump administration's support for capital punishment for drug traffickers. The decision may be linked to diplomatic considerations, as Mexico abolished capital punishment and typically requires assurances against it before extraditing its citizens.</p>
