          <p>President Trump, alongside Florida officials, has toured a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility, built rapidly on a remote airport runway, is designed to house several thousand detainees and is heavily fortified with security cameras and barbed wire. The project has drawn significant criticism from political opponents, who label it a "callous political stunt," and has sparked protests from demonstrators concerned about the treatment of immigrants. The center's funding is being provided in large part by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly approved a significant tax and spending package, a key component of President Trump's second-term agenda. The bill passed with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance after a prolonged debate lasting over 24 hours. The legislation, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term and implements spending reductions in social programs like healthcare, now returns to the House of Representatives. It faces an uncertain future in the lower chamber due to opposition from Democrats and some fiscally conservative Republicans.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, has accepted a plea agreement to avoid the death penalty. According to prosecutors, he will plead guilty to four counts of murder in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without any right to appeal.

          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab indicates that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would disproportionately benefit high-income households while financially harming the lowest earners. The report finds that the bill's tax cuts primarily aid the wealthy, whereas its significant spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP would reduce the income of the poorest 20% of households. These findings align with other nonpartisan analyses, including from the Congressional Budget Office, which also project the bill will add trillions to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Although the investigation ultimately concluded with no findings of misconduct, the family alleges that the university's actions effectively blocked Wu from rebuilding her career, contributing to her death.</p>

          <p>Ford announced that its vehicle sales surged by 14.2% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, significantly outperforming the estimated 1.4% industry-wide increase.

The automaker sold over 612,000 new vehicles during the quarter, with its electrified vehicle segment setting a record for the first half of the year.

          <p>Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate have proposed significant but differing cuts to Medicaid to offset the costs of President Trump's domestic policy bill. Both versions include new work requirements for recipients and would require more frequent eligibility verification, but they diverge on key details. For example, the Senate version expands work requirements to include parents of older children and proposes a different structure for phasing down state provider taxes.

This meeting, which took place at Biden's Delaware home, conveyed the deep lack of confidence within his own party following a disastrous debate performance.

Based on surveys of over 1,000 participants, the research noted that dairy products and sweets were most frequently blamed for causing nightmares and worse sleep. The study's authors theorize that the link between dairy and bad dreams might be due to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep. However, they caution that more substantive evidence is needed to confirm these self-reported observations.</p>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant single-month decline since February 2023. The slowdown is partly attributed to weaker demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax rules, which made property purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly dip, annual price growth stood at 2.1%, the slowest rate in nearly a year. Economists suggest this is a temporary soft patch, expecting the market to stabilize as buyers adjust to the new tax thresholds. (not investment advice)</p>

The broadcast, part of a gala celebrating a military pact with Russia, depicted a visibly emotional Kim and featured images of troops on the battlefield. Western intelligence estimates that North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops to support Russia, with South Korea estimating approximately 600 have been killed.

          <p>For savers looking to protect their money from inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently offer competitive returns, with many top accounts exceeding the inflation rate. While national average yields for one-to-five-year CDs range from 1.70% to 2.01% APY, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year CDs reaching 4.40% APY. Experts note that due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs often provide better returns than long-term ones at present. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to compare offers, particularly from online financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has directly attributed the central bank's decision to hold interest rates steady to President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Speaking at an event in Portugal, Powell confirmed that the Fed would likely have cut rates by now if not for the inflationary uncertainty created by the tariffs on imported goods. He explained that the Fed went "on hold" to assess the impact of the trade policies, which caused inflation forecasts to rise materially. The remarks highlight a significant rift between the White House's demands for lower rates and the Fed's cautious economic strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Chef RenÃ© Redzepi explained that he fell in love with the city's vibrant and diverse food scene, citing its grassroots creative energy and the quality of its ingredients. He was particularly inspired by the daring culinary spirit he found in places like Anajak Thai.
