          <h2>Fordo Nuclear Facility in Iran Remains a Focus of International Concern Amidst Rising Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, buried deep within a mountain, has long been a source of concern for international monitors due to suspicions of clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Despite Iranian leaders' denials, experts believe Fordo could be central to any such program because of its fortified location and the advanced centrifuges installed there. Recent IAEA declarations of Iran's non-compliance with monitoring efforts have heightened these concerns, especially since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal led to reduced cooperation with international inspectors. The possibility of the U.S. using bunker-buster bombs to disable the site has been discussed, reflecting the gravity of the situation. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to Trump, the attacks were successful, with all planes returning safely after dropping bombs on Fordo. The Israel Defense Forces also reported conducting strikes in southwestern Iran, targeting missile launchers and radar detection systems. These actions mark a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, with the U.S. military maneuvering B-2 stealth bombers in the Pacific ahead of Trump's decision to take action. </p>

          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House, signaling potentially improved relations between Belarus and the U.S. The release occurred after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, and European politicians welcomed the news. Despite this release, Belarus still holds over 1,000 political prisoners, and the country's human rights record remains a concern. </p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a law requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, making it the largest state to attempt such a mandate. The law, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, mandates the display of a 16x20-inch poster or framed copy of the commandments in classrooms. This measure is expected to face legal challenges based on the separation of church and state. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents, including faith leaders, contend it infringes on religious freedom. </p>

          <p>The BBC explores the growing trend of Y2K core, characterized by nostalgia for the late 1990s and early 2000s, as exemplified by the pop-punk band South Arcade. Despite not experiencing the era firsthand, younger generations are drawn to the music, fashion, and culture of the time, finding it offers a sense of escapism. Bands like Korn and Linkin Park, who were popular during the Y2K era, have also experienced a resurgence in popularity. The appeal lies in the pre-digital world's emphasis on physical items and a sense of individuality, contrasting with today's minimalist, digitally-driven culture. </p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee holds nearly five times more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee, with $72 million compared to $15 million, marking the widest disparity since at least July 2020. This financial advantage could provide the GOP with an early boost as they prepare for next year's midterm elections. Some Democrats suggest that the fundraising gap reflects deeper concerns within the party. The DNC, however, highlights a surge in grassroots support, raising roughly $40 million in individual donations since February.  (not investment advice)</p>
