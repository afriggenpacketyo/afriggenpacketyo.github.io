          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to dismantle the US Institute of Peace, a congressionally funded think tank.  The administration, through its "department of government efficiency" (Doge), had fired most employees after a late-night email.  The judge deemed Doge's actions illegal, citing "blunt force" tactics and declared all actions against the institute null and void.  This decision followed lawsuits filed by fired employees challenging the takeover.</p>
