          <p>India's information technology sector, a major contributor to its GDP, is experiencing significant layoffs, sparking concerns about the industry's future. While a global economic slowdown is a primary factor, the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence is transforming roles and displacing entry-level jobs, adding pressure to an already strained labor market. Economists warn that without significant upskilling of the workforce and a pivot to higher-value services, India risks falling into the middle-income trap, impacting urban consumption and overall economic stability.

          <p>A new report published in the Lancet medical journal describes plastic pollution as a grave and growing danger to human health, costing the global economy at least $1.5 trillion annually. Researchers highlight that plastic chemicals are linked to a range of diseases from infancy to old age, including impaired reproductive health, diminished cognitive function, and increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The report calls for a strong international treaty to address the crisis, noting that less than 10% of the 475 million tons of plastic produced annually is recycled.</p>

          <p>Unrest at a prison in Tuxpan, in the Mexican state of Veracruz, resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. The violence, which began Saturday and continued overnight, was reportedly sparked by inmates seeking protection from threats made by a violent criminal group within the facility. State and military forces regained control on Sunday morning, highlighting the ongoing challenges of gang violence and overcrowding within Mexico's prison system, where conflicts between cartels are often replicated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trade body for the UK's car finance industry has criticized a proposed compensation scheme for mis-selling as "completely impractical," particularly its retroactive scope to 2007. The Finance and Leasing Association raised concerns about the lack of records from both firms and customers, which would complicate fair redress decisions. While the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proceeding with its consultation, the industry warns that the estimated £9bn to £18bn cost could ultimately make borrowing more expensive for future consumers.</p>

          <p>In a move aimed at bolstering national and economic security, the Trump administration is imposing significant tariffs on imported copper and related products. This op-ed argues that the measure is necessary to counteract unfair foreign trade practices that have weakened the U.S. copper industry, leaving the nation dependent on foreign sources for a metal critical to defense and technology. The author asserts that these Section 232 tariffs will stimulate domestic investment, create jobs, and secure vital supply chains, similar to previous actions on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is running as an independent for a U.S. Senate seat in the Republican-leaning state of Nebraska. After a surprisingly strong performance in a previous race, Osborn is challenging incumbent Pete Ricketts with a campaign focused on representing the working class against wealthy political interests. By positioning himself outside the two-party system, he hopes to appeal to voters frustrated with political gridlock and believes his non-partisan, blue-collar message can build a unique coalition of support across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>Legal scholars and former prosecutors are raising alarms that the Department of Justice is being transformed into a political tool for President Trump to target his adversaries. The article points to the recent ousting of dozens of lawyers, including those who worked on cases involving Trump and his allies, and the launch of new investigations into figures like Barack Obama and James Comey. Critics argue these actions undermine the rule of law, replacing constitutional loyalty with personal loyalty to the president and creating a culture of fear within the department.</p>

          <p>The global production of farmed fur has experienced a dramatic collapse, falling from over 140 million animals in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024.

          <p>A recent federal report indicates a positive trend in adolescent mental health, with a notable decline in depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts among teens aged 12 to 17 between 2021 and 2024. The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in this group fell from nearly 13% to 10%, a development experts find very hopeful. While the exact causes are not detailed, increased willingness among teens to discuss their struggles and seek treatment may be contributing factors, though advocates stress that millions of young people still require better access to care.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency firm Coinbase has ignited a debate in the U.K. with a musical advertisement that satirizes the country's economic woes, including strikes, job losses, and a cost-of-living crisis. The ad, titled "Everything is Fine," was praised by many in the fintech and venture capital communities for its pointed critique but was viewed as cynical and misleading by others. The campaign is seen as a jab at the U.K. government's perceived slowness in embracing crypto and modernizing financial regulations, highlighting ongoing tensions between the industry and regulators.</p>

          <p>NASA employees have been asked by the Trump administration to draft plans to end two key satellite missions that monitor carbon dioxide and plant health, according to current and former staffers. The missions, known as the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, provide crucial data for climate scientists, farmers, and oil companies, and the equipment is expected to function for many more years. Ending the missions would be illegal according to some congressional Democrats, as Congress has already appropriated funding, raising concerns about White House overreach and the loss of invaluable climate data.</p>

          <p>Two men, aged 23, have appeared in court facing charges related to the kidnapping and sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. The case has drawn political attention after a local council leader alleged the accused were asylum seekers and accused authorities of a cover-up, a claim the BBC could not verify. Police and the Home Office have followed national guidance by not disclosing the immigration status of the charged individuals, stating that foreign nationals who commit crimes will face justice.</p>

          <p>In a significant move, the naval forces of India and the Philippines have conducted their first joint patrol in the disputed South China Sea. The two-day exercise, involving three Indian vessels and two Filipino frigates, comes as the Philippines seeks to strengthen military cooperation with allies amid a series of clashes with China in the contested waters. The maneuver is likely to be viewed as a provocation by Beijing, which claims nearly the entirety of the sea, though Filipino officials reported the patrol was successful and without any untoward incidents.</p>

          <p>India is in a difficult position following President Trump's threat of a "penalty" for its continued purchase of Russian oil, a trade that has surged since the war in Ukraine began. While Trump announced a 25% tariff, officials in New Delhi have remained noncommittal, stating their import decisions are based on market prices. Russia has become India's top oil supplier, and analysts suggest India is weighing its options, potentially using its Russian oil purchases as a bargaining chip while exploring alternatives to avoid a direct confrontation with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
