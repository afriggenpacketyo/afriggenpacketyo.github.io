          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured on Friday after escaping from an Arkansas prison nearly two weeks prior. Hardin, who was serving decades-long sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped from the Calico Rock prison by disguising himself in an outfit resembling a law enforcement uniform. He was apprehended near Moccasin Creek, approximately 1.5 miles west of the prison's North Central Unit, thanks to tracking dogs. Authorities confirmed his identity through fingerprint analysis, assuring the public that there is no longer an active threat to safety. The optimism score reflects the relief and stability brought about by the capture of a dangerous escapee.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 gang member who was previously deported to El Salvador, stating that the Department of Justice made the decision to bring him back to face federal charges. Trump expressed confidence in the DOJ's case against Abrego Garcia, who is now indicted on human smuggling and conspiracy charges. According to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Garcia played a significant role in a human smuggling ring, transporting women, children, and MS-13 gang-affiliated individuals throughout the United States. Democrats had previously advocated for Abrego Garcia's return, but Senator Chris Van Hollen stated the return was about due process rights.</p>

In 2020, German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters stated that he had evidence that Madeleine McCann was dead and identified Christian Brückner as a suspect.
