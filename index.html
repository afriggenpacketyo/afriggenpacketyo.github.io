          <h2>Singapore's July Inflation Rate Drops to 0.6%, Lowest Since January 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 02:53:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, reaching its lowest point since January 2021. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%, signaling a broader trend of price moderation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) attributes this decline to factors such as falling retail, electricity, and gas prices, along with an easing of global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price increases. This significant economic cooling strengthens the argument for the MAS to potentially loosen its monetary policy at the upcoming October meeting, aiming to provide a crucial buffer against the anticipated moderation in economic growth for the latter half of the year. Furthermore, the central bank expects core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is forecast to experience temperatures up to 30C on the upcoming bank holiday Monday, with regions like the Midlands and North-West expecting the highest heat. This could lead to record-breaking late August temperatures in parts of Wales and Northern Ireland, with warm weather also anticipated for events like the Notting Hill Carnival. However, this brief warm spell will quickly end as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are expected to bring blustery winds and rain across most of the UK by Monday night. This transition signals a return to more changeable, cooler, and wetter conditions for the remainder of the week, offering welcome relief to areas that have endured a particularly dry summer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced its intention to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in a transaction valued at approximately $18 billion. This significant deal, initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, involves Keurig Dr Pepper paying JDE Peet's shareholders 31.85 euros per share, which represents a substantial 33% premium over the Dutch firm's 90-day volume-weighted average stock price. A key strategic element of this acquisition is Keurig Dr Pepper's plan to subsequently split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies. This move effectively unwinds the 2018 merger that formed the third-largest beverage company in North America, signaling a strategic re-evaluation of its business structure.

          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. have begun carrying their assigned service weapons, acting on a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This move represents an escalation in President Trump's intervention into policing in the nation's capital, where nearly 2,000 Guard members are currently stationed. Despite earlier statements that troops would not be armed, the new guidance permits them to use force as a last resort against imminent threats. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have voiced concerns, asserting that the initiative is unnecessary given declining violent crime rates in D.C., which contradicts the president's claims of an "epidemic of crime."</p>

          <p>India's ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, asserted that India will continue to purchase oil from sources offering the "best deal" to protect the interests of its 1.4 billion people. This declaration precedes the implementation of 50% US tariffs on India, which include a 25% penalty for acquiring Russian oil and weapons. Despite US claims that these imports help fund the war in Ukraine, Delhi maintains its trade decisions are based on market factors and prioritize national energy security. India's Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar robustly defended this position, emphasizing India's strategic autonomy and criticizing the US's inconsistent application of secondary tariffs on other major importers of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>Daniil Medvedev was eliminated from the US Open in a dramatic first-round defeat against Benjamin Bonzi, following an on-court meltdown. The controversy erupted when a photographer walked onto the playing surface during Bonzi's match point, between his first and second serves. This unprecedented interference led to a six-minute delay and a furious reaction from Medvedev, who vehemently protested the umpire's decision to allow Bonzi another first serve, inciting the New York crowd. Despite the significant disruption, which initially caused Bonzi to lose focus, he ultimately secured a remarkable 6-3 7-5 6-7 (5-7) 0-6 6-4 victory. The United States Tennis Association has since revoked the photographer's credential for the 2025 US Open.</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets, particularly in China and Hong Kong, experienced significant gains on Monday, with the Hang Seng Index surging over 2% and approaching a four-year high. This robust rally was largely fueled by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole, which signaled potential interest rate cuts as early as next month. The tech sector, featuring companies like Nio and ASMPT, alongside Chinese property stocks such as China Vanke, recorded strong increases. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest that maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining this momentum, while a potential capital rotation from the US to China following Fed rate cuts is also identified as a key factor driving recent equity market gains.

          <p>President Donald Trump vehemently criticized the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, labeling it an unconstitutional affront to his presidential appointment power and accusing Democrats of using it to block his judicial nominees. He explicitly urged Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon this century-old custom, which grants home-state senators significant influence over judicial appointments, to allow "strong Republican candidates to ascend." Trump argued that this tradition effectively gives Democrats veto power, dramatically slowing his administration's ability to fill federal judgeships compared to his first term.

          <p>Global labor markets are undergoing a significant transformation, moving from the "Great Resignation" of the pandemic era to what economists now term the "Great Stay." This new phase is characterized by fewer employees voluntarily leaving their jobs and a cautious "no-hire, no-fire" approach from employers. Economic insecurity and uncertainty are compelling workers to remain in their current positions, especially in sectors like IT, while companies defer hiring decisions without necessarily reducing headcount. This trend is observable in both the US, with decelerating nonfarm payroll growth, and the UK, where job vacancies have decreased across most industries. Businesses are awaiting clearer economic signals before committing to new hiring, reflecting a widespread cautious sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The airline industry is on the cusp of a major transformation in booking technology, moving from traditional reservation systems to modern digital retail platforms. Companies like Flyr are developing "offer and order management" systems that will enable features like shopping carts, allowing passengers to combine different flights, seat classes, and ancillary services in a single booking. This aims to offer more personalized and flexible travel experiences, empowering passengers to easily modify or refund purchases. Riyadh Air is set to be the first "digitally native" airline, launching without legacy Passenger Service System (PSS) technology, signaling a significant shift in industry practices to compete with online travel agents.</p>

          <p>Boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been released from a prison in northern Mexico, where he was detained after his deportation from the United States. He is now awaiting trial on serious accusations of involvement with cartels and illegally trafficking arms into Mexico. A judge granted his release, but imposed conditions including a prohibition from leaving Mexico and a three-month period for further investigation into the case. Chávez, who has a documented history of drug addiction and multiple arrests, denies the claims, labeling them as "speculation" and "urban legends." This high-profile legal battle unfolds against the backdrop of the Trump administration's increased pressure on Mexico to intensify its efforts against organized crime.</p>

          <p>Some Starbucks workers are expressing significant dissatisfaction with the company's labor practices, citing low pay, erratic scheduling, and a perceived lack of corporate responsiveness to employee needs. While Starbucks offers benefits like healthcare and stock grants, many baristas feel the company's intense focus on cost-cutting has eroded its commitment to workers, leading to understaffing and unstable hours. Following a critical New York Times report, Starbucks pledged reforms, including ending "clopening" shifts and providing schedules further in advance. However, employees, some struggling to make ends meet on current wages, remain skeptical, fearing the changes are more about public relations than genuine improvement.</p>

This crisis disproportionately affects Black infants, who die at more than twice the rate of White infants, reflecting deep structural inequities. The state plans to expand prenatal services, regionalize obstetric care, and strengthen community health programs to address the issue.
