            <p>President Trump, at 78, underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed, his first such exam of his second term. While promising transparency, the White House plans to release a summary of the findings. Trump's health details have been limited since 2018, and he avoided providing updates during the 2024 campaign. The 2018 evaluation showed "excellent" cardiovascular health for his age, with concerns limited to high cholesterol and being overweight, conditions managed with medication.</p>

            <p>Experts suggest China is bracing for economic hardship, viewing Trump's tariffs as 'bullying' and aiming to lessen reliance on the U.S.. Xi Jinping appears confident in China's resilience, believing other nations will gravitate towards China due to tariff-induced uncertainty. China could retaliate by restricting business operations for more companies and curbing exports of essential resources like rare earth minerals, potentially disrupting global high-tech supply chains. Some analysts believe Trump has already signaled weakness by pausing reciprocal tariffs, encouraging China to delay.</p>

            <p>President Trump suggests trade partners can avoid tariffs by increasing energy purchases from the U.S.. Trump is pushing for 'energy dominance' and wants the EU to buy $350 billion in American energy to reduce the trade deficit. The U.S. is already a major oil and gas producer and exporter. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is seen as a commodity with the potential for increased exports to countries seeking to avoid tariffs.</p>

            <p>Despite rising recession fears and China's retaliatory tariff hikes, Donald Trump insists his trade war is 'doing really well'. A recent economic survey indicates soaring consumer expectations for price growth, reaching a four-decade high. Beijing raised tariffs on US products to 125%, accusing Trump of 'unilateral bullying'. Some Wall Street figures express concern, with BlackRock's CEO suggesting the US might already be in a recession, while JPMorgan Chase's CEO highlights 'considerable turbulence' in the economy.</p>

            <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported a glitch in the system used for tariff exemptions, impacting freight shipments from China and nations under the 90-day pause. The glitch prevents the collection of tariffs, adding to the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the new trade policies. Customs is advising importers to file cargo release forms separately and pay duties later, causing confusion and increased paperwork. Experts worry about Customs' ability to handle the rapid pace of tariff changes, potentially disrupting business decisions and economic growth.</p>

            <p>Analysts estimate a 'Made in the USA' iPhone could cost significantly more due to higher labor costs and tariffs on imported parts. The iPhone 16 Pro, currently priced at $1,199, could increase by 25% based on labor alone, potentially reaching $1,500. One analyst estimated Apple would need to spend $30 billion over three years to move 10% of its supply chain to the U.S.. Challenges include finding a skilled U.S. workforce and navigating trade policy changes, making a fully American-made iPhone unlikely.</p>

The airline also lowered its first-quarter outlook, citing weakened demand and fare discounting across the industry. Frontier attributed the weaker demand to a drop in consumer confidence in March.
