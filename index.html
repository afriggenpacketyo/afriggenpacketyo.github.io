          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting departments such as Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The budget prioritizes homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure while significantly reducing discretionary funding. It also proposes a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion for the southern border. Senator Patty Murray criticized the proposal for defunding programs that help working Americans and favoring tax breaks for the wealthy.</p>

The Conservative party experienced significant losses, while the Liberal Democrats increased their council seats and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire councils.

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has responded to President Donald Trump's executive order to cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, asserting that Congress, not the president, controls its funding. The CPB emphasized its independence from the federal government, as established by Congress, which forbids any government entity from exercising control over public broadcasting. Trump's order claims that NPR and PBS have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda, while critics argue the move is authoritarian and threatens fact-based news for millions of Americans.

          <p>Jussie Smollett and the city of Chicago have reached a settlement agreement after his conviction for staging a hate crime was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Smollett, who initially reported being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in 2019, was later convicted of orchestrating the incident himself. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the conviction, citing a due process violation, as Smollett had already performed community service and forfeited a $10,000 bond as part of an earlier agreement. Details of the settlement remain undisclosed, and the parties are scheduled to meet in court later this month.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 216 pediatric deaths this flu season, marking the highest number in 15 years since the swine flu pandemic. Overall, the CDC estimates at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations, and 26,000 deaths from the flu this season, with data still preliminary and subject to change. Health officials attribute the severity of this season to declining flu vaccination rates among children, which have fallen from 64% to 49% in recent years. Research indicates that flu vaccinations are highly effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths, even if they don't prevent illness entirely.</p>

          <p>Gardening, while often seen as a source of fresh produce and beautiful flowers, offers valuable life lessons about resilience, patience, and community. Starting a garden can be overwhelming, but talking to friends, borrowing books, and simply getting started are great ways to begin. Gardening also teaches the importance of relinquishing control and embracing surprises, both positive and negative. Connecting with nature through gardening can improve mental well-being, reduce stress, and foster a sense of community, even when things don't go as planned.</p>
