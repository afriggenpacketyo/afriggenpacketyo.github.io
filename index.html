        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating expanding its tariff-free rice imports from the United States as part of ongoing negotiations regarding increased levies imposed by Washington. The proposal involves raising the import amount from the U.S. to approximately 410,000 tons, up from the current 350,000 tons. Japan currently imports about 770,000 tons of rice tariff-free globally each year. This consideration reflects Japan's effort to balance trade relations amidst evolving economic pressures from the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>Germany is facing a "cocaine surge" and a general increase in hard drug use, according to the head of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). The official said the international drug trade is shifting focus to Europe due to market saturation in North America. He also expressed concerns that the recent partial legalization of cannabis has complicated police work, making it harder to prove drug dealing. The incoming coalition government plans to evaluate the cannabis legalization in autumn 2025, with potential for reversal.</p>

          <p>Following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining legal sex as biological sex, Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson stated that provisions and services should be accessed based on biological sex. While stopping short of explicitly stating trans women should use men's toilets, Phillipson reiterated the ruling's clarity. She emphasized the need for appropriate services for all people, including trans people, and noted that many businesses already offer unisex or individual cubicle options. The EHRC is expected to provide additional guidance to ensure safe and respectful access to services for everyone.</p>

The Supreme Court has issued orders related to the program, but the administration's actions have been met with criticism and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Tarik El-Abour, a professional baseball player with autism, who has defied negative stereotypes often associated with the condition. El-Abour's success contradicts statements made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who claimed that autistic individuals would never be able to hold jobs or play baseball. El-Abour, who is currently playing in a scouting league, emphasizes that his autism helps him focus and embrace repetition, qualities beneficial for a baseball player. The article also highlights other autistic athletes who have achieved success in professional sports.</p>

          <p>Assistance for Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollees facing coverage issues may be harder to obtain due to federal staff reductions. Two out of six divisions of caseworkers have been eliminated, potentially impacting the resolution of complex issues. The cuts come as ACA enrollment is at an all-time high, and proposed changes to the ACA could create further confusion and problems for consumers. These changes, coupled with fewer caseworkers, could extend the time needed to resolve difficulties. (not investment advice)</p>
