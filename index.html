          <h2>Warner Bros. Discovery Announces Plan to Split Into Two Public Companies</h2>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced its intention to divide into two separate publicly traded entities by mid-2026, marking a significant shift in the media industry as it adapts to the transition from traditional cable to streaming services. The split will create a streaming and studios company, housing movie properties and HBO Max, and a global networks company, which will include CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head the global networks business. This strategic move aims to empower the brands with sharper focus and flexibility to compete effectively in the evolving media landscape. The announcement follows earlier reports of WBD considering such a split and comes as Comcast prepares to spin off its cable networks into a new company. The market responded positively, with Warner Bros. Discovery shares rising over 9% in premarket trading. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf dismissed a controversy surrounding a social media post where he criticized an MP's call for a burka ban as a "storm in a teacup." Yusuf, who initially resigned after criticizing MP Sarah Pochin, later returned to work for the party in a different role. The controversy began when Pochin questioned the Prime Minister about banning the burka, prompting Yusuf's critical post. Yusuf expressed regret over the post, attributing it to exhaustion, and clarified his views on face coverings, suggesting a broader ban rather than one specifically targeting the burka. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage acknowledged the incident as a "speed bump," noting Yusuf's quick regret over the comments. </p>

          <p>Following days of clashes between law enforcement and protesters in Los Angeles sparked by immigration enforcement operations, President Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. Protests escalated, resulting in clashes with soldiers, property damage, and freeway blockades, leading to numerous arrests and injuries to both protesters and officers. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it a chaotic escalation. The protests were triggered by ICE operations in the area, which resulted in arrests and sparked widespread demonstrations against federal immigration policies. The article outlines the sequence of events, the reactions of various officials, and the ongoing tensions between federal and local authorities regarding immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is urging the European Union to streamline its financial systems by establishing a single regulator. In a letter to the European Commission, NBIM argues that "better and simpler regulation" is crucial for EU markets to improve business dynamism and attract institutional investors. NBIM, which manages Norway's oil and gas revenues, held â‚¬285 billion in securities issued by EU member states and European corporations at the end of 2024. The fund emphasizes the need to address regional fragmentation in securities law, corporate law, insolvency, and tax regimes, as well as standardize the pan-European debt issuance process. </p>

          <p>ABC News suspended senior national correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a critical message on X targeting White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and President Trump. Moran's post, which was later deleted, described Miller as "richly endowed with the capacity for hatred" and accused Trump of using hatred for self-glorification. ABC News stated that the post violated their standards of objectivity and impartiality. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned Moran's comments as "unhinged and unacceptable," while Vice President JD Vance described the post as a "vile smear." The incident follows a recent defamation settlement between ABC News and Mr. Trump related to a reporting error in the E. Jean Carroll case. </p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive aerial attack on Ukraine, deploying nearly 500 drones and 20 missiles, according to Kyiv officials, marking the largest barrage of the war. Ukraine's air force claimed to have intercepted 277 drones and 19 missiles, with only a small number hitting their targets, resulting in one reported injury. The attacks primarily targeted central and western regions of Ukraine, often occurring at night to exploit the difficulty of spotting drones in the dark. Despite the ongoing conflict, the Kremlin stated Russia remains committed to prisoner of war exchanges and repatriation of deceased soldiers, accusing Kyiv of failing to uphold its end of the agreement. The return of prisoners and bodies is one of the few areas of agreement between the warring parties amid stalled broader negotiations. </p>

          <p>Democrats are struggling to connect with voters, particularly young men, and are exploring strategies to create their own media presence to compete with influential voices. However, experts argue that the party's problem extends beyond media representation to a broader issue of authenticity and relatability. The party's tendency towards "D.C. speak" and a fear of alienating potential voters are hindering their ability to connect with the public. While some Democrats have found success by being themselves and engaging in open conversations, a top-down approach to manufacturing a liberal version of popular figures is unlikely to succeed. </p>

Cryptocurrency firms have become significant political donors, spending heavily in recent elections to support both Republican and Democratic candidates. The GENIUS Act, aimed at creating a regulatory structure for stablecoins, has garnered bipartisan support, although some Democrats are pushing for amendments to prevent Trump and his family from profiting from stablecoins.

          <p>The Labour Party is attempting to put behind them a misstep regarding the Winter Fuel Payment, which initially limited the payment to pensioners receiving pension credit, a decision that drew criticism. The government has since reversed course, expanding eligibility for the payment, and is now clarifying who will qualify and who will need to repay it. The reversal is projected to cost Â£1.25 billion, raising questions about how the government will finance it without permanently increasing borrowing. The incident has been viewed as a significant setback for the Labour government, prompting questions about their fiscal management and policy decisions. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants, arguing they are globally insignificant. However, a new analysis shows that emissions from American fossil-fuel plants contribute 5% of global planet-heating pollution, making the U.S. power sector the sixth-largest emitter worldwide. The move is part of a broader effort to dismantle environmental regulations, despite concerns about the health and economic impacts of power plant emissions.
