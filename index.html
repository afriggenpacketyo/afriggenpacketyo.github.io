          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant surge after a tax on solar and wind projects, which would have primarily affected components from China, was removed from the Senate's version of a major legislative bill. Companies like NextEra Energy and Array Technologies saw their shares jump, reflecting investor relief. The provision had been criticized by industry groups as punitive, potentially adding billions to the sector's tax burden. Despite this positive development, the Solar Energy Industries Association warned that the overall bill remains detrimental to the renewable energy sector, as it still phases out key investment and production tax credits that have historically supported the industry's growth.

          <p>Apple has filed a lawsuit against Di Liu, a former senior design engineer for its Vision Pro headset, accusing him of stealing thousands of confidential documents before leaving to join competitor Snap. The lawsuit alleges that Liu downloaded sensitive files containing information on Apple's technology, product design, and supply chain during his final two weeks at the company. Apple claims Liu concealed his new role at Snap, which prevented the company from immediately revoking his access to proprietary systems. The tech giant is seeking damages and a forensic inspection of Liu's devices to ensure all stolen trade secrets are deleted, continuing its pattern of legally pursuing former employees over information leaks.</p>

The company recently hired top researchers from competitors like OpenAI and Google to form a new "Meta Superintelligence Labs" (MSL), a move that could add an estimated $1 billion in annual expenses. Despite the high cost, Wall Street appears to be giving Meta a pass, believing these investments will enhance user engagement, improve ad targeting, and eventually lead to new revenue streams. However, the performance of Meta's Llama large language model, which currently lags behind competitors, will be a key metric for evaluating the success of this costly strategy.

          <p>A Republican legislative proposal aims to provide tax relief to seniors through a new temporary deduction, rather than by eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits as previously discussed. The Senate's version of the bill proposes a "senior bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for eligible taxpayers, while the House version suggests $4,000, both targeting individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes under $75,000. This approach is designed to benefit lower- and middle-income seniors more directly than a full tax repeal would. However, critics from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget warn that this deduction, combined with other tax cuts in the bill, would accelerate the insolvency dates for both Social Security and Medicare.

          <p>Following Elon Musk's threat to form a new political party if a major spending bill passes, this article examines the significant hurdles facing any third-party movement in the United States. The American "winner-takes-all" electoral system, dominated by Democrats and Republicans for over a century, presents a formidable structural barrier. Experts note that successful third parties typically require a strong grassroots movement fueled by popular unrest, substantial funding, and the ability to tap into widespread dissatisfaction. However, history shows that even when third parties gain traction, they often act as "spoilers" by drawing votes away from major candidates, prompting the established parties to adopt their popular policies, which ultimately leads to the third party's decline.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank would have likely lowered interest rates this year if not for the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariff plan. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell confirmed that the announcement of higher levies on imported goods caused inflation forecasts to rise materially, forcing the Fed to maintain its current policy stance. This admission provides context for the Fed's decision to hold rates steady despite pressure from the White House for an ease in monetary policy. Powell reiterated that future decisions will be data-dependent and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis, declining to signal whether a rate cut could be expected in July. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate-passed Republican spending package includes an expansion of the child tax credit, though policy experts note that its structure may exclude some of the lowest-income families. The Senate bill proposes permanently increasing the maximum credit to $2,200, while the House version calls for a temporary increase to $2,500. A key issue is the credit's partial refundability, which limits the benefit for families who earn too little to owe federal income tax. Because the credit is tied to earnings and only a portion is available as a cash refund, the poorest households may not be able to access the full value of the proposed increase, highlighting a persistent challenge in designing tax relief for low-wage earners.</p>

The presiding senator sustained the point of order, and the title was removed from the legislative text. Schumer later told reporters that the name was misleading and that the bill represented a "big ugly betrayal" that would harm millions of Americans, a sentiment echoed by other Democrats who condemned the bill's passage.</p>

This agreement would see Kohberger plead guilty to four counts of murder in exchange for four consecutive life sentences, thus avoiding the death penalty. Ben Mogen, father of victim Madison Mogen, expressed relief at avoiding a prolonged trial and appeals process. In contrast, the family of Kaylee Goncalves voiced fury, stating they were not consulted and believe the deal fails to deliver full accountability for the November 2022 stabbings. A change of plea hearing is expected soon, where a judge will ultimately decide whether to accept the agreement.</p>

Other suggested uses include funding strategic home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, or financing a small business venture or educational pursuits.

However, vaccine experts interviewed by NPR have raised significant concerns about the study's validity. They point out that the research relies on data from the early 1980s, a period with vastly different infant mortality rates, and uses observational methods that are not as reliable as randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, subsequent research by the same authors did not replicate the negative findings, and numerous international health bodies, including a WHO advisory committee, have repeatedly reviewed the evidence and found no cause for concern regarding the DTP vaccine's safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services from proceeding with its planned mass layoffs and major agency restructuring. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 Democratic attorneys general who argued the overhaul would cause "severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible" harm to public health services nationwide. In her decision, Judge Melissa DuBose stated that the Trump administration's plan lacked a "rational basis" and that HHS failed to provide evidence that critical services would continue uninterrupted. The plan, announced by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., involved laying off some 10,000 employees and consolidating numerous sub-agencies, a move the judge found was outside the executive branch's authority without congressional action.</p>

          <p>This analytical article questions the political strategy behind the Republican party's push to pass its massive tax and spending bill, describing the move as incomprehensibly reckless. The legislation, which pairs large, regressive tax cuts with significant reductions in programs like Medicaid and food assistance, is deeply unpopular in polls and is projected to add trillions to the national debt. The author explores several potential explanations for the GOP's persistence, including a reliance on a partisan media bubble that downplays the bill's negative impacts and a genuine ideological commitment to its principles. Ultimately, the piece suggests that the primary driver is the unstoppable political momentum created by President Trump, who has ruthlessly enforced party loyalty to pass his signature legislation.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a prominent televangelist whose global ministry was famously rocked by a sex scandal in the 1980s, has passed away at the age of 90. Swaggart built a media empire through his televised sermons, founding the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge and the SonLife Broadcasting Network. His career took a dramatic turn in 1988 when he was caught with a sex worker, leading to a tearful, nationally televised apology to his followers and his defrocking by the Assemblies of God. Despite this and subsequent controversies, including another scandal and inflammatory remarks about other religions and gay people, he continued to preach and record gospel music for the remainder of his life.</p>

Key provisions include new work requirements for Medicaid, an increased cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and a new tax deduction for tipped workers.

          <p>Civil society groups in Togo report that several people were killed during anti-government demonstrations in the capital, Lome, over the weekend. The unrest was sparked by controversial constitutional reforms that position long-time leader Faure Gnassingbe to remain in power indefinitely, a move opponents have labeled a "constitutional coup." A coalition of opposition parties and civil rights organizations accused security forces of using tear gas, batons, and committing abuses against protesters. While the government acknowledged that bodies were recovered from a lagoon, it claimed the deaths were due to drowning. This was the second major protest in a month, despite an official ban on demonstrations in the country.</p>

          <p>A provision within the Republican-led budget package would create a new federal tax deduction for tipped workers, but critics argue it may not help the lowest-paid employees. The proposal, a key part of President Trump's economic agenda, would eliminate federal income tax on a portion of tip earnings, with the House and Senate versions offering different deduction limits and income caps. While the White House estimates this would boost take-home pay for eligible workers, policy analysts note that over a third of tipped workers already earn too little to owe federal income tax and thus would not benefit. Labor advocates argue that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to support low-wage workers.</p>

Since then, egg prices have started to decline, although they remain significantly higher than a year ago. The removal of the surcharge at the popular 24-hour diner chain, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually, reflects a broader, albeit slow, normalization of food prices after a period of intense inflation.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether pursuing credit card debt forgiveness is a sensible strategy for consumers struggling with high balances, particularly in the current high-interest-rate environment. Forgiveness programs can potentially reduce a person's debt by 30% to 50% for those with significant balances and a demonstrated financial hardship. With credit card APRs near record highs, taking action is crucial, as delaying can lead to spiraling interest costs. However, the article cautions that forgiveness is not a universal solution, as it can negatively impact one's credit score and takes time to complete. It advises individuals to thoroughly explore all alternative debt relief options, such as debt management or consolidation, before committing to a forgiveness plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charter Communications, the parent company of Spectrum, has stated that a recent act of vandalism that cut fiber-optic lines in Los Angeles should be considered "domestic terrorism." The June 15 incident in Van Nuys severed 13 cables, disrupting internet and phone service for over 50,000 customers and affecting critical facilities like a military base and 911 dispatch centers. The company argues that the intentional nature and severe impact of such attacks on vital communications networks pose a significant threat to national security and public safety. This call for reclassification comes as the telecommunications industry reports a rising number of deliberate attacks on its infrastructure nationwide.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Use of Defamation Lawsuits by Politicians as a Political Weapon is on the Rise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 13:25:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are expressing concern over a growing trend of politicians from both parties using defamation lawsuits as a political weapon against media organizations. This tactic, once primarily associated with Donald Trump, has seen a bipartisan escalation with Governor Gavin Newsom's recent suit against Fox News. Experts warn that this litigious environment has a chilling effect on free speech and puts immense pressure on news outlets, especially publicly owned companies that may have other business before the government. The trend risks weakening long-standing press protections and weaponizing the legal system for political gain, a development that legal scholars find pernicious and troubling for the future of journalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist and state assembly member, has been officially confirmed as the winner of New York City's Democratic mayoral primary. The final ranked-choice voting tabulation showed Mamdani defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo by a significant 12-point margin. Mamdani's victory, which was widely expected after he took a commanding lead on election night, represents a stunning upset and a major win for the progressive wing of the party. He will now face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November general election. Cuomo, who conceded on primary night, is still contemplating an independent run.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts Major Overhaul of Environmental Law to Accelerate Housing Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 13:11:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in an effort to address the state's severe housing shortage. Governor Gavin Newsom pushed for the changes, which will exempt most new housing projects built within existing urban areas from the law's strict environmental review process. Proponents, including housing advocates, argue this will remove bureaucratic roadblocks that have long been weaponized to block desperately needed construction. However, some environmental and social justice groups have vehemently opposed the move, warning that it undermines public participation and could facilitate harmful industrial development in low-income communities without proper scrutiny.</p>
