          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched investigations into four companies operating 34 pornography websites over their adherence to new age verification rules. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, mandate effective tools to prevent minors from accessing adult content. The investigation follows previous probes into other platforms and comes amid public debate, with a petition to repeal the act gaining significant traction while the government maintains its stance. Critics also question the effectiveness of the measures, pointing to the increased use of VPNs to bypass the checks.</p>

          <p>Moderna will cut approximately 10% of its global workforce by the end of the year due to dwindling sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and market uncertainty. The company, which saw its shares drop over 20% this year, aims to reduce annual operating expenses by about $1.5 billion by 2027. CEO Stephane Bancel stated the decision was difficult but necessary to align the company's cost structure with business realities while continuing to invest in its product pipeline. The restructuring comes as Moderna navigates new policy hurdles and prepares to release its quarterly results.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to review the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The case challenges a lower court's ruling that blocked the duties, arguing the president overstepped his authority as Congress holds the power to levy tariffs. The Trump administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs, which it has declared national emergencies. The outcome of this legal battle will significantly impact a central component of Trump's economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a rival proposal for Heathrow Airport's expansion, challenging the airport's own plan. The "Heathrow West" proposal features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive process of diverting the M25 motorway. Arora's plan estimates a cost under £25 billion and aims for the runway to be operational by 2035, arguing it presents a lower-risk and more cost-effective solution. This marks the first time competing bids have been invited for the expansion, a project long debated and delayed.</p>

          <p>A group of 43 peers, including prominent lawyers, has cautioned the UK government that recognizing a Palestinian state could violate international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria outlined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. This comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets certain conditions. The government has defended its position, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 UN members already recognize Palestine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 20-minute radar-related issue within the UK's air traffic control system, managed by NATS, led to significant travel chaos on Wednesday, grounding flights and causing over 150 cancellations. The system was quickly switched to a backup, but the brief outage forced a reduction in air traffic for safety, causing knock-on delays that continued into the next day. This is the second major NATS failure since 2023, prompting sharp criticism from airlines like Ryanair and easyJet. Experts explain that even a short failure degrades the system's capacity from a "motorway" to a "country lane," especially during peak travel season.</p>

          <h2>Post-Pandemic Strategies Diverge for Vaccine Makers Moderna and BioNTech</h2>

          <p>Moderna and BioNTech, the two companies that became famous for their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, are now pursuing distinctly different business strategies. Moderna has doubled down on its mRNA technology, investing its pandemic windfall into a large pipeline of other vaccines. In contrast, BioNTech has used its earnings to diversify through acquisitions, notably expanding into promising new cancer therapies. This strategic divergence is reflected in their stock performance, with BioNTech's shares gaining while Moderna's have slid, as Wall Street assesses their long-term viability beyond the COVID-19 vaccine boom.

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, is traveling to Israel and the Palestinian territories to press for a ceasefire and address the "unimaginable scale" of suffering in Gaza. The visit comes amid growing international pressure on Israel and as more European nations consider recognizing a Palestinian state. The trip also follows an open letter from over 200 German celebrities urging the government to halt arms exports to Israel. A member of the delegation suggested that Germany's recognition of a Palestinian state is "not a taboo" and could happen sooner than previously expected.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its shares to jump over 9% in premarket trading. The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and improvements in its Aetna insurance unit. While Aetna has been grappling with higher medical costs in its Medicare Advantage plans, the division's performance was better than anticipated. The positive results mark a potential turnaround for the company under CEO David Joyner, who took over in late 2024 amid struggles to improve profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Energy giant Shell reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, despite the impact of lower global oil and gas prices.

CEO Wael Sawan noted the company's performance was strong despite a challenging macroeconomic environment.

          <p>A China-led international expedition has discovered the deepest known chemosynthesis-based ecosystem on Earth, located up to 9,500 meters deep in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The researchers found thriving colonies of tubeworms and molluscs in the hadal zone, a region previously thought to be largely barren. These organisms derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions involving methane and hydrogen sulphide seeping from tectonic faults. This remarkable discovery, published in the journal Nature, challenges existing models of life at extreme limits.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has announced she will not enter the 2026 race for governor of California, a decision that throws the contest wide open. In her statement, Harris acknowledged that politics and institutions have "too often failed the American people" and called for "new methods and fresh thinking." Having served in elected office for over two decades, her decision to step away from a gubernatorial run leaves her future political path open. Allies suggest she will likely focus on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections, positioning herself as a central figure in shaping the party's future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite having an elite quarterback in Joe Burrow, the Cincinnati Bengals' window to win a Super Bowl may be closing due to questionable team-building decisions. The analysis argues that the franchise has failed to adequately build around Burrow, retaining the same coaching core and making minimal roster upgrades this offseason. The team has become bogged down in contract disputes and has a recent history of anemic drafts, leaving the roster with significant holes, particularly on the offensive line and in the pass rush. The franchise seems to be banking on Burrow's individual brilliance to overcome these deficiencies.</p>

          <p>Rodney Taylor, a double amputee with electronic prosthetic legs, was placed in solitary confinement at the Stewart detention center in Georgia after complaining about a flooded cell. Taylor, a Liberian-born man detained by ICE, refused to enter the cell due to the risk of water damage to his prosthetics. His case highlights the challenges disabled individuals face within the immigration detention system, as he has also struggled to receive proper maintenance and fitting for his prosthetic legs. Advocates say his experience demonstrates a system ill-prepared to handle detainees with anything beyond basic medical needs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Emil Bove, a lawyer known for his loyalty to Donald Trump, to a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Court of Appeals. The confirmation proceeded despite a letter from over 80 retired judges and allegations from multiple whistleblowers that raised serious ethical concerns. Whistleblowers claimed Bove directed lawyers to defy court orders and misled Congress, among other issues. Critics argue his confirmation sets a dangerous precedent, rewarding personal fealty over judicial independence and undermining faith in the judiciary's impartiality.</p>
