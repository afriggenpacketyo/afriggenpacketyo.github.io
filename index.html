          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 07:20:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chancellor has announced that changes to the winter fuel payment will be implemented this year, allowing more people to qualify for the allowance. This decision reverses a previous policy that limited the payment to those on pension credit, a move widely criticized after local elections. While details on the specific changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear, the government aims to address concerns from charities and MPs regarding pensioners with slightly too high incomes who were affected by the previous policy. The pensions minister clarified that the payment will not revert to a universal system benefiting all pensioners, including millionaires, but eligibility will be expanded, with further details expected in the autumn Budget. Optimism for the economic situation has resulted in this partial reversal of the measure. </p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, after a nine-year hiatus due to preparation complexities. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a change from the original version that offered grilled or fried chicken with various sauce options. Customers have been actively petitioning for the return of the Snack Wrap, with one Change.org petition garnering nearly 19,000 signatures.

          <p>NFL legend Carl Banks engaged in a social media dispute with radio host Gregg Giannotti after Giannotti criticized Knicks player Karl-Anthony Towns, calling him a "loser" on WFAN. Banks defended Towns, citing his personal knowledge of Towns and his family, and Giannotti responded by claiming Banks owed him money from a past appearance. Giannotti's criticism stemmed from Towns' performance and salary, which he believes hinder the Knicks' progress, while Banks viewed Giannotti's comments as genuinely pathetic. The Knicks' season ended with a Game 6 loss to the Indiana Pacers, highlighting defensive issues the team faced throughout the series.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its potential to increase the US budget deficit and create unsustainable debt. Musk expressed his disappointment on X, hinting at potential campaign challenges against politicians who supported the bill in the upcoming midterm elections. The bill, which includes tax breaks and increased defense spending, has faced opposition from various factions within the Republican Party, including Senator Rand Paul, who opposes raising the debt ceiling. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the bill, emphasizing President Trump's unwavering support, but other Republicans expressed differing opinions on the matter.</p>

Trump has criticized these rulings, claiming they are driven by hatred and questioning the judges' motives.

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a former Charles Manson follower, has been recommended for parole after serving 56 years for her role in the Tate-LaBianca murders. The decision marks a significant step for Krenwinkel, who has been incarcerated longer than any other woman in California, but her release still requires approval from the governor, who has previously vetoed similar parole decisions in high-profile cases. Supporters argue that Krenwinkel has demonstrated substantial rehabilitation, survived abuse, and poses no threat to society, while family members of the victims continue to oppose her release. Advocates highlight the growing recognition of the impact of childhood trauma and the psychological control exerted by cults, urging a reevaluation of her case in light of these factors.</p>

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home also fell 4%, although they were 18% higher than the same week last year, with increased supply on the market being the main driver of demand.

          <p>A State Department employee published a radical piece on the department's Substack, accusing European governments of waging an aggressive campaign against Western civilization. The author, Samuel Samson, a recent college graduate with no foreign policy experience, criticized Europe's governments and implied that the US would punish allied governments if they did not change their policies on free speech, election administration, and migration. Samson's writings suggest a deliberate strategy to seed the US government with radical opponents of philosophical liberalism who aim to replace it with a form of illiberal Christian government. His ascent in the State Department demonstrates the success of this radical right strategy of 'entryism'.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has successfully implemented a universal pre-kindergarten program, offering public elementary school to all 4-year-olds regardless of income. The program's success is attributed to a combination of motivated individuals and strategic legislation that closed a loophole and addressed concerns from private childcare facilities. The program avoids the common issues of bankrupting private childcare by allowing public schools to contract existing qualified providers. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's focus on the 'how' rather than the 'why,' emphasizing the importance of keeping the childcare industry afloat, developing an appropriate curriculum, and building sufficient facilities to feel the benefits.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to reduce imports of Russian gas and oil, the European Union has increased its purchases of Russian fertilizer since the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's share of EU fertilizer imports has grown to about 30%, raising concerns about dependence on Russia and undermining fair competition for European producers. The EU plans to introduce tariffs on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, gradually increasing them to 50% by 2028, to encourage sourcing from alternative markets or increasing the use of organic fertilizer. While fertilizer producers support the tariffs, farmers' groups are concerned about the lack of affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer.</p>

The girls' mother reported that Decker had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and was supposed to seek mental health treatment under the parenting plan, but never did.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that it is "extremely hard" to make a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid rising trade tensions. This statement comes as White House officials suggest that the two leaders may speak this week, despite stalled trade talks. Washington and Beijing have blamed each other for violating a trade agreement reached in Switzerland on May 12, with China criticizing the U.S. for limiting China's access to advanced technology and revoking visas for Chinese students. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has described the recent U.S. actions as based on "groundless reasons" that undermine China's interests.</p>

The inner section of the Oort Cloud resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy. This discovery, relying on data and simulations, challenges the previous understanding of the Oort Cloud's shape and could provide clues about the orbits of distant comets.</p>

The parasites, called trematodes, can cause gastrointestinal problems and other health issues if ingested. The parasite was probably carried to the U.S. by the red-rimmed melania, or Malaysian trumpet snail, which is host to a number of parasitic species and was introduced to the United States, Hechinger estimates, decades ago.

          <p>New research suggests that a sustained signal in the brain, following an experience, is crucial for generating an emotional response. The study, involving air puffs to the eye, found that an initial sensory phase is followed by a sustained phase in emotion-related circuits. Disrupting this sustained phase with ketamine blocked the emotional response, indicating its importance in linking experience and emotion. While the study provides insights into the neural basis of emotion, some researchers argue that the sustained signal may be involved in other cognitive processes as well.</p>
