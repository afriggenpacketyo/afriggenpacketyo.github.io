          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping marked the 80th anniversary of World War II's end with a major military parade in Beijing, where he stated the world faces a choice between "peace or war" and "dialogues or confrontation." The event, attended by leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, showcased China's growing military capabilities and emphasized national sovereignty. U.S. President Donald Trump, in a social media post, urged Xi to acknowledge U.S. contributions to China's freedom while accusing Beijing of conspiring against Washington alongside Russia and North Korea. The parade highlighted shifting global alliances, with Western leaders largely absent, reflecting China's increasing regional influence and its complex relationship with the U.S. and its allies.</p>

          <p>A brush fire erupted in the Hollywood Hills, with flames rapidly moving uphill through dense vegetation towards several residential properties. The blaze, which started north of West Sunset Boulevard, prompted a rapid response from both city and county fire departments, deploying air and ground crews. Initial reports indicated one vehicle was on fire, but within half an hour, helicopter water drops were significantly slowing the fire's progression below the homes. Approximately 80 firefighting personnel were assigned to contain the quarter-acre blaze, with no structures reported involved at the time.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading as investors evaluated rising global bond yields and ongoing trade developments. Chinese markets were particularly attentive following President Xi Jinping's speech at a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II's end, an event attended by numerous world leaders including Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw an increase, while mainland China's CSI 300 also edged up. In contrast, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined despite stronger-than-expected Q2 GDP growth, and Japan's Nikkei 225 also recorded losses, with government bond yields rising across the region.

          <p>Ben Griscti, a player for Australia's Adelaide 36ers basketball team, is recovering from a fractured vertebra sustained when a backboard collapsed during practice. The incident occurred after a teammate's dunk, forcing Griscti to miss the start of the National Basketball League season. Despite the severity of the injury, which is not expected to require surgery, there was a reported 90-minute delay for an ambulance to arrive, attributed to other emergencies in the territory. Griscti has since returned home, and while no timetable for his return has been set, he expressed gratitude for support and intends to be back soon.</p>

The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates and adopted a more optimistic outlook, despite reducing its overall economic growth forecast for the year due to lower productivity. Consumer and business confidence are also reportedly rising, suggesting an end to a long period of consumer pessimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump dismissed recent speculation about his health as "fake news," asserting that he was highly active over the Labor Day weekend, engaging in media interviews and visiting his Virginia golf course. The rumors, which circulated on social media, were fueled by his lack of a public schedule for two days and comments from Vice-President JD Vance, who suggested he was prepared to step in if anything happened. Trump expressed frustration over the constant scrutiny of his well-being, reiterating his robust health and rejecting claims that anything was amiss. This ongoing cycle of speculation and dismissal highlights the intense media focus on the health of public figures and the rapid spread of unverified information online.</p>

          <p>US filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court battle against Rochdale Borough Council to gain control of Hopwood Hall, his ancestral stately home in Greater Manchester, which he has been working to restore since 2017. DePree claims he fulfilled the conditions of a £1 purchase agreement by securing planning permission to refurbish the 15th-century building as an event venue, investing £750,000 of his own money. However, the council argues he failed to produce a viable business model and locked him out in November 2024, leading to accusations of evasive and misleading conduct. This legal dispute highlights the complexities and challenges inherent in large-scale heritage preservation projects.</p>

          <p>Valentine Low's new book, "Power and the Palace," reveals several anecdotes about the British royal family, including Queen Camilla's experience fighting off a sexual assault as a teenager. The book recounts how Camilla, then a teenager in the 1960s, used her shoe to defend herself and ensured the perpetrator's arrest, a story she later shared with Boris Johnson. This disclosure aligns with Queen Camilla's public campaigning against domestic abuse and violence against women, aiming to destigmatize such experiences. Other revelations in the book include Queen Elizabeth II's private views on Brexit, insights into royal finances, and interactions between royals and politicians.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a U.S. strike on a Venezuelan drug-carrying vessel resulted in 11 deaths, marking what appears to be the first U.S. military operation against drug cartels in the southern Caribbean. Trump identified the crew as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. designated a terrorist group, and alleged ties to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. This action follows the U.S. doubling its reward for Maduro's arrest and deploying warships to the region. Venezuelan officials deny the gang's current activity in their country and Maduro has threatened a "republic in arms" if attacked by U.S. forces.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, spewing lava 330 feet into the sky from its summit crater, marking the 32nd such episode since December 2024. All lava from this ongoing eruption has remained contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied from a lower chamber, inflating the volcano and forcing molten rock through narrow vents to the surface, creating spectacular fountains. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has a history of such repeated eruptions, and while scientists can predict eruptions days in advance, the ultimate duration and form of the current activity remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Safer Living Foundation, a unique UK program that significantly reduced reoffending rates among sex offenders, has been forced to close due to a lack of funding. Operating in Nottingham, the foundation provided a safe space and support for individuals with sexual convictions, achieving a 2% reoffending rate compared to the national average of 15.1%. Its closure highlights a societal reluctance to fund rehabilitation efforts for sex offenders, despite evidence suggesting such programs are effective in preventing further harm and protecting potential victims. Experts argue that greater investment in community-based treatment and early intervention is crucial to address the scale of sexual offenses.</p>

Despite being found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, Google was not forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, a key demand from the Department of Justice. The decision allows Google to continue making payments for preloading its products, albeit with restrictions against exclusive contracts.

          <p>Police forces and councils nationwide have issued fresh warnings regarding a surge in parking scams, ranging from fake text messages about unpaid tickets to card-skimming devices on parking machines. Scammers employ various deceptive tactics, including urgent language and fake official websites, to trick individuals into divulging personal information or making fraudulent payments. Experts advise checking for specific details on genuine fines, avoiding clicking suspicious links in texts, and inspecting payment machines for tampering. If targeted, individuals should restart devices, change passwords, and contact their bank's fraud department to protect themselves from financial harm, underscoring the need for constant vigilance against evolving fraud schemes.</p>

This decision is significant for Apple, as the revenue from Google's default search engine deal is crucial for its services business.

Testimony revealed a National Guard commander was questioned about his "loyalty to the country" for hesitating on a show-of-force operation.
