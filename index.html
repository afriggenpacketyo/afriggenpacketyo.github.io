          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to send military troops to Portland, Oregon, to address what he terms "domestic terrorists" targeting federal facilities. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Oregon's Democratic governor and senators, who argue there is no insurrection and accuse the president of attempting to provoke violence for political gain. While the Pentagon has confirmed its readiness to support the Department of Homeland Security, local officials have stated that no federal assistance is necessary or welcome. The planned deployment is part of a broader pattern of using federal forces in cities with ongoing protests.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 5 storm in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting alerts for Bermuda. While no immediate watches or warnings are in effect for the United States, the storm is generating powerful swells expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the season and is forecast to remain a major hurricane for several days. Forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda, another system developing in the region that could impact the Southeast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially suspended his campaign for re-election, citing financial pressures and media speculation that have hindered his ability to run effectively. The decision comes after a judge allowed the city's Campaign Finance Board to review his now-dismissed federal corruption case, making it unlikely he would receive public matching funds. Adams, who faced a five-count indictment that was later dropped, will remain in office to serve out his term but did not endorse another candidate. His withdrawal significantly reshapes the mayoral race just weeks before the election.</p>

          <p>The master of ceremonies for the Ryder Cup has stepped down after being recorded leading a profane chant directed at European golfer Rory McIlroy. The incident is one of several instances of unruly fan behavior that have marred the golf tournament at Bethpage Black in New York, with McIlroy and his wife being subjected to frequent jeers. Two spectators were ejected for a verbal altercation, and both team captains have commented on the crowd's behavior, with Europe's captain stating some fans "crossed the line." The emcee has since apologized for her actions.</p>

          <p>Moldova has held a critical parliamentary election that will determine its future alignment with either the European Union or Russia. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of "massive interference" through disinformation and vote-buying schemes, a claim pro-Moscow parties deny. The election pits Sandu's ruling party against a pro-Russian bloc in a tight race, with the large diaspora vote expected to be a significant factor. The outcome is pivotal for the nation, which is situated between Ukraine and Romania and has been heavily impacted by the regional conflict.</p>

Democrats are insisting that extending the healthcare tax credits, which are set to expire, must be part of any deal to keep the government open, warning of soaring premiums for millions of Americans. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune argue that the subsidy issue is a separate policy debate for the end of the year.

          <p>European golfer Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match at the Ryder Cup because of a neck injury. As a result, his match against Harris English of the United States has been declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. The unexpected withdrawal changes the point dynamics for the final day, with Europe now needing only two more points to retain the trophy. Hovland's injury flared up on Saturday, and he was unable to recover in time for the final session.</p>

          <p>Denmark has issued a temporary nationwide ban on all civilian drone flights after multiple unmanned aerial vehicles were spotted near military facilities and airports. The sightings, which caused significant disruptions including the closure of Copenhagen's airport, are being treated as a potential "hybrid attack," though no specific actor has been officially named. The ban is timed to coincide with an upcoming EU summit in the country, and a German air defense frigate has arrived to assist with airspace surveillance. Russia has denied any involvement in the incidents.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system. The proposal passed with 50.4% of the vote, a much tighter margin than polls had predicted. This revised plan, which keeps all data stored on individual users' smartphones and under government control, was developed after a previous version was rejected in 2021 over privacy concerns. Supporters believe the digital ID will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy infringements and data tracking.</p>

          <p>The Health Ministry in Gaza has reported that the death toll from the ongoing war with Israel has now exceeded 66,000 Palestinians. The update comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss a new 21-point ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the conflict. The plan reportedly includes the release of all remaining hostages and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces. International pressure on Israel continues to mount, with key allies recognizing a Palestinian state and considering sanctions amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a public health crisis as diabetes rates have nearly doubled over the past 20 years, now affecting over 16% of the adult population, the highest in the European region. Public health experts attribute the dramatic increase to lifestyle factors and criticize the government's food and health policies, citing a lack of regulation on unhealthy foods and insufficient preventative care. High obesity rates and the widespread use of starch-based sugars are identified as major contributing factors. Critics argue that without a fundamental policy shift focused on prevention, especially among children, the situation will not improve.</p>

The statement comes as North Korea has continued to advance its weapons programs and strengthen ties with Russia and China. However, Kim reiterated that his country's nuclear status is non-negotiable and that any meeting would depend on Washington abandoning its "obsession with denuclearization." The U.S. State Department has maintained its commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, leaving the prospects for a productive summit uncertain.</p>

The demonstrations, which were initially sparked by a government ban on social media, turned violent, resulting in at least 72 deaths and widespread property damage. Young protest leaders claim the violence was caused by outside infiltrators and are now focused on building a new political future, with discussions underway to form a new party ahead of elections scheduled for March 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government is providing a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker and its supply chain manage the fallout from a month-long production shutdown caused by a cyber-attack. The shutdown has suspended work at JLR's UK facilities, raising concerns that some suppliers could face collapse. A local MP has suggested that further government assistance may be necessary to stabilize the situation. The incident has been described as a "wake-up call" for British businesses to improve their cybersecurity defenses against increasingly frequent and sophisticated attacks.</p>

          <p>The European Union's steel industry is concerned about the potential expansion of U.S. tariffs to a growing list of "derivative" products containing steel. After the Trump administration raised tariffs on direct steel imports to 50%, it is now consulting on adding more goods, such as furniture or window frames with metal components, to the list. European business leaders and politicians warn that this ad-hoc process creates significant uncertainty and additional costs for manufacturers. The move is part of a broader protectionist strategy by the U.S. aimed at shielding its domestic industry from foreign competition. (not investment advice)</p>

The tragedy occurred at a campaign event for actor-turned-politician Vijay, where the crowd size was reportedly more than double what had been approved by authorities. The sudden surge of people forced the speaker to halt his address and led to the deadly stampede. Police have filed a case against senior members of Vijay's political party, and the state's chief minister has announced compensation for the victims' families.</p>
