          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air experienced a significant IT outage, leading to a temporary, system-wide ground stop for all their flights. The airline issued an apology for the inconvenience, warning of residual impacts and advising passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the ground stop request, though the specific cause of the computer issues was not immediately disclosed, causing widespread travel disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and prudent policymaking. While it exhibits defensive characteristics during financial stress, its market size is significantly smaller than traditional safe havens like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc. Experts believe that while hurdles like market depth and a managed exchange rate constrain its global role, it has the potential to grow into an important diversification asset for investors.

          <p>Following a week of deadly sectarian clashes in Syria's Druze-majority city of Sweida, armed Bedouin clans have announced their withdrawal under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The fighting, which killed hundreds and displaced over 128,000 people, prompted humanitarian aid convoys to enter the southern city. Despite the cautious calm, tensions persist, with some Bedouin fighters remaining on the outskirts and demanding the surrender of a local Druze leader they blame for the violence.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight operating for Delta Connection was forced to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The pilot, in an apology to passengers, stated the military aircraft appeared unexpectedly and that he was not given a heads-up by air traffic control. The FAA and SkyWest are investigating the incident to determine how the two aircraft came into such close proximity during the jet's landing approach.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast is emerging in the energy policies of the U.S. and China, particularly as the demand for electricity from technologies like AI grows. While China is forging ahead with significant investments and ambitious goals in renewable energy, the Trump administration is actively canceling tax credits for wind and solar, labeling them "unreliable." This divergence in strategy highlights the different approaches the two global powers are taking to address both climate change and the race for technological supremacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to derail the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the change and that he might restrict the deal for the new D.C. stadium if the team does not comply. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 confirmed infections, making it a top-10 country globally for outbreaks and surpassing U.S. case numbers. The spread, concentrated in provinces like Alberta and Ontario, is linked to low vaccination rates and fueled by a post-pandemic rise in vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Health officials are struggling to contain the highly contagious virus, which was declared eliminated in Canada in 1998, highlighting a major public health challenge.</p>

          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, the stock market is being buoyed by strong corporate earnings and numerous pro-business provisions in President Trump's recent legislation, according to some analysts. These provisions, including tax cut extensions and new deductions, are expected to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy, potentially offsetting tariff impacts. Furthermore, massive spending on data centers, energy infrastructure, and defense, combined with a more favorable environment for mergers, creates a positive outlook for equities.

          <p>The UK government has warned that people retiring in 2050 are projected to be worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are boosted. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions, noting that nearly half of working-age adults are not saving into a private pension. The analysis revealed stark disparities, including a significant gender gap in private pension wealth and low savings rates among certain groups.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ believes the technology is on the verge of a major breakthrough, predicting it will cross a practical "usefulness" threshold within the next five years. The company, founded in 2018, currently produces small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful superconducting systems for industrial use. The firm's CEO compared the current state of quantum technology to the pivotal era of semiconductors in the 1950s, just before integrated circuits revolutionized computing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with most Americans now saying the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. The poll also shows a strong desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices, as disapproval of Trump's handling of inflation has reached a new high. While the president's political base remains strongly supportive, the broader public shows growing doubt about his policies.</p>
