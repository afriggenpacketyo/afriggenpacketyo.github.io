          <p>An official from Spain's government has attributed recent anti-migrant violence in the southeastern town of Torre Pacheco, Murcia, to inciting social media posts disseminated by far-right groups. The unrest led to five minor injuries and one arrest, as groups armed with batons roamed the streets seeking foreign-origin individuals, with social media videos depicting clashes and burning barricades. This disturbance followed an attack on an elderly man, though the reasons behind that initial assault are still unclear. Authorities are now actively investigating possible hate crimes and appealing for calm, particularly in a town where migrants comprise a substantial portion of the population.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Pam Bondi, America's Attorney General, amidst growing calls for her resignation concerning the Jeffrey Epstein files. Critics, including prominent conservative figures and major campaign donors, accused Bondi of failing to deliver significant revelations about Epstein's client list, despite her earlier promises. A Justice Department memo, co-released with the FBI, explicitly stated there was no incriminating client list or evidence of blackmail against high-profile figures. This ongoing controversy underscores a perceived division between the FBI and the Justice Department, with some of Trump's allies expressing considerable frustration over the lack of anticipated disclosures.</p>

          <p>Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reports that President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained a minor leg injury during an alleged Israeli airstrike on a secure government facility in Western Tehran last month. The alleged attack, which reportedly targeted entry and exit points and cut power to disrupt air flow, forced officials to escape through an emergency hatch. Iran claims this strike, occurring during a 12-day conflict with Israel, was similar to a plan that led to the assassination of a Hezbollah leader. Israel has previously stated its military targets Iranian leaders and nuclear scientists to prevent nuclear weapon development, with the broader conflict ultimately ending in a U.S.-brokered ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Genetic genealogy, a sophisticated technique initially developed for family history research, is revolutionizing cold case investigations, notably leading to the capture of the infamous Golden State Killer. Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney with a biology Ph.D., pioneered this method by meticulously building family trees from crime scene DNA, helping identify perpetrators decades after their offenses. Her groundbreaking work, now continued by her firm Firebird Forensics, has since solved numerous sexual assault and homicide cases, including the decades-old "John Doe #147" case. While raising some privacy concerns, this powerful forensic tool offers victims and law enforcement a critical new path to long-awaited justice.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly bolstered its security measures. The agency is deploying military-grade drones for enhanced aerial reconnaissance and establishing mobile command posts to drastically improve direct communication with local law enforcement, addressing critical failures identified during the Butler incident. These substantial upgrades, costing up to $1.5 million per unit, aim to prevent a repeat of the July 13, 2024, shooting, which injured Trump and killed one rallygoer. Six personnel were recently suspended following an internal investigation, as the Secret Service works diligently to restore confidence in its protection protocols and capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new Senate report has revealed that the U.S. Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled multiple critical requests to bolster President Trump's security apparatus before the July 2024 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. Authored by Sen. Rand Paul, the report sharply criticizes "communication failures and negligence," directly contradicting earlier Secret Service testimony to Congress. Requests included enhanced counter-drone systems and additional counter-assault personnel, with a lack of formal process for resource requests cited as a major contributing factor. The findings highlight fragmented communications, as the agent leading communications at Butler was assigned just two days prior and reportedly unaware of a second command post.</p>

Liverpool has officially retired Jota's number 20 shirt across all club areas, and head coach Arne Slot encouraged players to openly express their grief.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" following Donald Trump's threat to impose a sweeping 30% tariff on nearly all EU imports. In response, the EU has strategically paused €21 billion in retaliatory tariffs until August 1, aligning with Trump's new deal deadline, while simultaneously finalizing a significant free trade agreement with Indonesia to diversify its global markets. Macron's strong call for trade war readiness, however, contrasts with more pragmatic responses from Germany and Italy, who advocate for a swift negotiated solution. The tariff threat is widely perceived as a negotiating tactic, yet it has sparked considerable fury and heightened concerns over existing global instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is making "transshipping" a central focus of his latest trade efforts, threatening higher tariffs on goods that make pit stops in third countries to evade duties. This strategy, partly aimed at curbing China's alleged circumvention of trade barriers, could fundamentally redefine how global trade operates by expanding the definition of "substantial transformation." While the precise rules are still under negotiation on a country-by-country basis, this aggressive stance has already angered China and raised significant concerns among supply chain logistics companies about increased complexity and potential litigation.

          <p>Veteran actor Richard Kind, widely recognizable from roles in "Curb Your Enthusiasm," "Only Murders in the Building," and as the voice of Bing Bong in "Inside Out," openly embraces his status as "just a little famous." Despite not always being a household name, Kind has cultivated a respected 45-year career across Broadway, film, and television, including his current role as announcer and sidekick on John Mulaney's Netflix show. He attributes his enduring self-assurance to learning to laugh at himself, a valuable defense mechanism developed in childhood. Kind humbly views his success as contributing to the whole, famously stating he is "parsley on a plate of meat and potatoes," yet the freshest parsley.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, the 72-year-old French woman who garnered international recognition after publicly testifying at her mass sexual assault trial last year, has been awarded France's highest honor, the Legion of Honour. Pelicot courageously waived her right to anonymity during the high-profile case against her husband, who systematically drugged and sexually assaulted her, additionally inviting dozens of other men to abuse her over nearly a decade. Her profound dignity and courage in seeking to "make shame swap sides" from victim to perpetrator deeply moved and inspired France and the world. Her husband was ultimately sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in jail for aggravated sexual assault, and Pelicot's memoir is set for release next year.</p>

Co-curated by his granddaughter, Isca Greenfield-Sanders, the exhibit showcases his five-decade artistic journey and his pivotal role as one of the youngest participants in the landmark 1951 9th Street Show. Sanders, a lifelong friend of renowned artists Willem and Elaine de Kooning, skillfully navigated the burgeoning art world while steadfastly prioritizing his family life. The exhibition serves as a significant reintroduction of his profound contributions to the first homegrown international art movement in the United States.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has announced the killing of two Russian agents, stating they were "liquidated" after resisting arrest, following the recent shooting death of a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer, Colonel Ivan Voronych. SBU head Vasyl Malyuk confirmed that the agents, tracked by Ukrainian security services, were responsible for Voronych's death. The SBU, which primarily focuses on internal security and counter-intelligence, has played a prominent role in sabotage and assassinations deep inside Russia since the 2022 invasion, and claims responsibility for previous high-profile killings of Russian generals. This incident underscores the escalating covert operations and intense counter-intelligence efforts in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples reveals five essential weekday habits that significantly contribute to the happiest relationships, habits often neglected amidst busy schedules. These practices include cultivating a "mini morning routine" for initial connection, sending thoughtful check-ins throughout the workday to stay top-of-mind, and prioritizing individual "me time" to de-stress before reuniting. Crucially, happy couples intentionally carve out daily "us time" without distractions, and conclude the day with a quiet check-in to address any unsaid thoughts or feelings. These small, consistent, and intentional rituals are vital for fostering emotional intimacy and preventing minor issues from escalating, ensuring a strong connection even on the most hectic weekdays.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese Shijian satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have successfully docked in geostationary orbit, potentially marking a historic in-orbit refuelling mission. US-based space situational awareness provider COMSPOC reported that the satellites "appeared visually merged" for several days in early July, following multiple close approaches observed since June. If confirmed, this would represent a significant autonomous satellite servicing feat that the United States has yet to achieve. The observations, including flanking by US surveillance satellites positioned for optimal viewing, highlight the advanced capabilities China is developing in space technology and complex orbital operations, pushing the boundaries of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Dame Melanie Dawes, head of media regulator Ofcom, has publicly urged the BBC to "get a grip quicker" on controversies and expedite internal investigations to restore flagging public trust. She specifically cited the "own goals" related to the broadcast of Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance and a withdrawn Gaza documentary, which she believes have significantly eroded public confidence. Dawes emphasized the BBC's perceived slow response compared to immediate public awareness, calling for faster conclusions to ongoing reports. While acknowledging the BBC's usual high-quality output, she warned that continued delays risk a "real risk of a sort of loss of confidence" in the corporation, particularly as the Culture Secretary demands explanations for recent incidents.</p>

These influential figures, commanding vast young male audiences, operate with perceived impunity, blurring the lines between traditional media and online platforms. Their open embrace of conservative values, anti-"woke" sentiments, and glorification of traditional "male" ideals mirrors Donald Trump's cultural politics, effectively normalizing his brand of "popularly elected vandalism."
