          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations purportedly related to Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the death of Iranian Armed Forces Chief Mohammadhossein Bagheri and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Hossein Salami. The strikes also reportedly killed two leading Iranian nuclear scientists, prompting Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to pledge retaliation, while Israel declared a state of emergency and warned of potential missile and drone attacks. Oil prices surged, and U.S. stock futures declined amid fears of a broader regional conflict, with the U.S. stating it was not involved but had been briefed beforehand and directing its embassy in Jerusalem to shelter in place. The article reports fatalities in Tehran and airstrikes on Natanz, Khandab, and Khoramabad, sites of key nuclear facilities and a ballistic missile base, as tensions escalate in the Middle East. Optimism is low as the situation indicates a dangerous escalation. </p>

          <p>According to an expert with the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins are not a viable alternative to gold and do not pose a threat to its role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist and head of research at the association, argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He emphasized that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the notion of crypto as 'gold 2.0'. Reade's comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices due to heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar.

          <p>Israel launched preemptive airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and research scientists, initiating what it described as a potentially days-long operation, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," aimed at rolling back Iran's nuclear capabilities, leading Iran to threaten retaliation. Iranian state television reported the death of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps head Hossein Salami, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the strikes would continue until the threat is removed. The United States affirmed it was not involved in the operation, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing the priority of protecting American forces in the region and urging Iran not to target U.S. interests. President Trump convened a National Security Council meeting, and the U.S. Embassy in Israel advised personnel to shelter in place amid the threat of Iranian retaliation, adding further tension to the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily paused a court order that would have required President Trump to return control of the California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to Gov. Gavin Newsom. This emergency stay came after a U.S. District Judge ruled that Trump's mobilization of the Guard amid protests over immigration raids was illegal. The 9th Circuit scheduled a hearing for the following Tuesday, meaning the National Guard will remain federalized through the weekend. The legal battle centers on whether Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the 10th Amendment, with Newsom arguing the deployment was designed to inflame the situation and deprive the state of resources.</p>

The average age for first-time mothers also increased from 26.6 in 2016 to 27.5 in 2023, with experts citing factors such as changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, dropping from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023, which may be attributed to delayed sexual activity or improved contraceptive practices among adolescents. This trend reflects broader societal shifts in family planning and reproductive health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Israel's broad and sweeping attack on Iran, characterizing it as a preventive war rather than a preemptive strike, highlighting the moral and practical risks associated with such actions. The author differentiates between preemptive attacks, which thwart imminent threats, and preventive attacks, which remove the source of a threat based on a judgment call about timing. Israel's actions are compared to historical examples of preventive wars, such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American war on Iraq, while acknowledging the potential justification for Israel's actions given Iran's history and genocidal intent. The article concludes that Israel's campaign may be necessary but carries immense danger, urging Israel to acknowledge the existential threat from Iran rather than relying on shaky rationales about preemption.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily halted a judge's ruling that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles, allowing the administration to proceed with the deployment while the court considers the appeal. The initial ruling by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that California officials were likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles. Newsom had argued that Trump unlawfully bypassed him when calling the National Guard into service, but the appeals court granted an administrative stay in response to the government's emergency motion. This legal battle highlights the ongoing tensions between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement and the use of military forces in civilian contexts.</p>

          <p>The owner of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic, Antonio Espaillat, and his sister Maribel Espaillat were arrested following a roof collapse in April that resulted in the deaths of 236 people. Authorities accused the Espaillats of negligence for failing to prevent the collapse, which also left over 180 people injured, and of attempting to intimidate or manipulate company employees who could serve as witnesses. The Espaillats were arrested after being interrogated for several hours, while a government-appointed committee continues to investigate the cause of the collapse. The nightclub, which had operated for nearly five decades, was known for its Monday night merengue parties that attracted international celebrities and high-profile Dominicans.</p>

          <p>North Korea announced that it has successfully repaired and relaunched a 5,000-ton destroyer that was damaged in a failed launch attempt last month, with leader Kim Jong Un attending a ceremony to mark the achievement. During the ceremony at the Rajin shipyard, Kim revealed Pyongyang's plan to build two more destroyers of the same type annually, and he also acknowledged that a worker had died during the repair work. The newly launched warship is scheduled to be handed over to the navy around mid-2026, while in April, Kim attended a ceremony for the launch of another new 5,000-ton destroyer at a shipyard in the western port city of Nampho.</p>

          <p>A burglary suspect was killed in a Lynwood home after being shot, with authorities suspecting that the shot was fired by an accomplice during the heist. Deputies responded to a call about a burglary in progress and found a man who had been shot and died at the scene, and homicide detectives believe the man was part of a group of about five men who entered the home. The suspects were startled by a resident, and while fleeing, one of them fired a weapon, striking one of their own, with the other suspects last seen running north on Linden Street, while the identity of the deceased has not been released.</p>

          <p>The United States has publicly distanced itself from the Israeli military strikes in Iran, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating that the U.S. was not involved and emphasizing the priority of protecting American forces in the region. Rubio warned Iran not to retaliate against U.S. interests, as Iranian state TV accused Washington of being "complicit" in the attack, which it claimed had "killed children". The Israeli strikes, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, targeted Iran's nuclear program and other military sites, prompting Israel to declare a state of emergency and anticipate retaliation, with Israeli officials reportedly notifying the U.S. before beginning the strikes. Prior to the strikes, President Trump warned that a military operation against Iran would "blow" negotiations to curb its nuclear program, but also indicated that something "could well happen," while the U.S. had partially evacuated embassy staff from Iraq amid concerns of potential retaliation.</p>

          <p>Democrats have criticized the forcible removal of Senator Alex Padilla by Secret Service and FBI officers at a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, calling it a "violent" and "horrifying" abuse of power. Padilla was grabbed, shoved, and pushed to the ground before being handcuffed after he showed up and asked a question about Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Tensions have been high between Democrats and the Trump administration over the use of the National Guard and Marines to quell protests against the administration's anti-immigration program in Los Angeles, and a district judge issued a temporary restraining order on the deployment. Democrats are characterizing the incident as a sign of authoritarianism and a threat to dissent in America.</p>

Unlike tourists in many places, visitors to China are often impressed by the beauty and innovation of subway stations in major cities, which are often sparkling clean. China has built bigger and more infrastructure projects than anyone else, including dams, bridges, and high-rises, and its STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by more than eight to one. Most of the nationâ€™s top officials are engineers, whereas in the US, their counterparts are often lawyers, leading Wang to contrast China's 'engineering state' with the US's 'lawyerly state'.</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Antonio Brown is reportedly wanted by Miami authorities on the charge of attempted murder with a firearm, stemming from an altercation at a Miami boxing event in May. A warrant calls for Brown to post $10,000 bond and remain under house arrest until trial, with the incident involving a physical altercation and witnesses claiming Brown was the shooter. The alleged victim, who had known Brown since 2022, told police that Brown ran toward him with a gun and shot at him twice, potentially grazing his neck, leading to a fight over the weapon, though Brown has claimed he was "jumped" and was only being detained to share his account. Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowler with a history of off-field issues, last played in the NFL in 2021 and has since faced multiple legal troubles.</p>
