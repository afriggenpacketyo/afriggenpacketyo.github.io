          <p>Voters in South Texas have approved the incorporation of SpaceX's launch facility into a new city named Starbase. The vote, largely supported by SpaceX employees, formalizes the area as a city, granting it control over local governance. While SpaceX officials state this move is to foster community growth and streamline launch operations by potentially closing Boca Chica Beach, critics worry about Elon Musk's increased control over the area and environmental impact. The city's creation coincides with SpaceX's request to increase launch frequency, sparking debates over public access and environmental justice.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Harry's unsuccessful appeal to reinstate his UK security, Meghan Markle subtly expressed her support by sharing a family photo on social media. The photo depicts Harry with their children in Montecito, California.

Harry has expressed a desire for reconciliation with the royal family, admitting his father King Charles is currently not speaking to him due to the security dispute.</p>

          <p>Since Donald Trump's return to power, widespread firings of federal workers, particularly probationary employees, have led to chaos and legal challenges. While some workers have been rehired due to court orders, many remain in limbo, facing uncertainty over their job status, backpay, and benefits. The administration's actions, driven by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge), have been criticized as a "sham" and a "hellish way of treating people." The situation has disrupted government functions, eroded job security, and raised concerns about the loss of expertise within the civil service.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions, China may consider selling off U.S. Treasury bonds as a retaliatory measure, potentially impacting mortgage rates. Experts suggest that such a move could significantly affect the U.S. economy, particularly homeowners. While the Chinese central bank has stated it has no immediate plans to alter its foreign reserves, the possibility of future actions remains. The impact would stem from the fact that mortgage rates tend to track the 10-year Treasury yield, so it doesn’t bode well for mortgages if investors decide to sell U.S. Treasury bonds.

          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This comparison can lead to insecurity and feelings of inadequacy in the recipient. The phrase often stems from a deeper issue: a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations. Open and clear communication, without shame or comparison, is essential for a thriving relationship.</p>
