          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan faced hours of suspension due to a non-operational train halting between stations. The JR East reported that the train stopped in Tochigi Prefecture, north of Tokyo, around 11:25 a.m., leading to service disruptions on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line between Tokyo and Sendai stations. Passengers on one of the affected trains were transferred using a gangplank to another train, while the other train returned to Utsunomiya Station. Service resumed at 5 p.m. after inspections were conducted. The incident underscores the challenges in maintaining the reliability of high-speed rail infrastructure. </p>

President Trump's plan to deport as many illegal immigrants as possible has faced criticism due to its potential economic consequences. Studies have shown that illegal immigrants do not take jobs away from native-born citizens and that their removal can worsen the economy. The analysis suggests that the primary motivation behind mass deportations is to instill terror and control, rather than to improve economic conditions. </p>

Additionally, rising rates of cannabis use among young people may exacerbate mental health issues. </p>
