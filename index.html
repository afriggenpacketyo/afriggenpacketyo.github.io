          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is defending the company's ambitious $850 billion plan for a global network of AI data centers, a project with an energy demand equivalent to powering over 13 million homes. Acknowledging concerns about a potential market bubble and a circular financing model with partners like Nvidia and Oracle, Altman insists the massive buildout is necessary to meet the soaring, near-infinite demand for AI compute power. He frames the enormous investment and its associated risks as a natural part of a historic technological revolution, confident that the long-term value of AI will be gigantic for society.

          <p>In response to a noticeable decline in tourist numbers, Las Vegas is actively courting local residents with significant discounts on hotels, dining, and attractions. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has launched a campaign framing a Nevada ID as a key to special offers, with major resorts like Caesars and Virgin Hotels offering substantial rate reductions and perks. While some locals observe that weekends remain busy, the city-wide effort aims to fill the midweek gap by encouraging "staycations" and boosting local spending to support the community's primary industry.</p>

          <p>An unusually aggressive squirrel in San Rafael, California, has attacked multiple people, sending at least two individuals to the emergency room with bites and scratches. Residents in the Lucas Valley neighborhood have posted warning flyers after several unprovoked attacks where the squirrel reportedly leaps onto people. A local wildlife rescue organization suggests the squirrel's behavior may stem from being hand-fed by humans as a baby, leading it to lose its natural fear. Experts remind the public not to feed wild animals, although they also note that squirrels are not considered vectors for rabies.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has adopted a noticeably softer diplomatic tone towards China, calling for engagement in a "spirit of mutual understanding." This shift comes as the EU seeks Beijing's assistance on critical global issues, including the war in Ukraine and climate change. While acknowledging Europe's ongoing concerns about China's export controls and market access, the more conciliatory language marks a departure from previous, more assertive stances.

          <p>A sniper opened fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and critically injuring a third before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, noting that unspent shell casings found near the shooter were engraved with anti-ICE messages. This attack is the latest in a series of violent incidents targeting Texas immigration facilities, prompting federal and state officials to condemn the violence and call for an end to what they describe as dangerous political rhetoric against law enforcement.</p>

A government source affirmed its commitment to the project but emphasized the need to "get this right" by learning from past mistakes. The repeated postponements have caused frustration, as the plan was anticipated to be a key announcement at the upcoming Labour Party conference.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has been framed by many on the political right as their version of a "George Floyd moment," signaling a belief that the left has made coexistence impossible. Conservative author Tanner Greer explains that Kirk was seen not just as an organizer but as a symbol of competing democratically, making his death feel like an attack on the very possibility of civil political engagement. This perspective helps explain why prominent Republicans are blaming a collective "they" rather than an individual shooter, fueling an emotional and sometimes authoritarian response rooted in a deep sense of personal and political loss.</p>

          <p>A bronze-painted statue depicting President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands appeared on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., but was removed by U.S. Park Police in less than 24 hours. The installation, titled "Best Friends Forever," was placed by an activist group called The Secret Handshake, which had a permit for it to remain for several days. The Department of the Interior stated the statue was removed for non-compliance with the permit, though the group alleges it was an illegal removal intended to suppress critical speech. The White House dismissed the artwork, acknowledging the past association but stating Trump had ostracized Epstein.</p>

          <p>Medical professionals are pushing back against President Donald Trump's assertion that taking Tylenol during pregnancy is linked to a "very increased risk" of autism, a claim not supported by conclusive scientific evidence. Obstetricians report receiving anxious calls from patients and worry the remarks will cause unnecessary fear, potentially leading pregnant women to avoid the safe and recommended pain reliever for dangerous fevers. While some studies have explored a possible association, major medical organizations maintain that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is safe for use during pregnancy when needed, and that untreated pain or fever poses a greater risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inexpensive, generic drug called leucovorin, derived from folic acid and typically used to treat chemotherapy side effects, is being studied as a potential treatment for autism. Some researchers theorize that certain children with autism have a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, and leucovorin can bypass this issue. One family reported their nonverbal son began speaking just days after starting the off-label treatment. While preliminary studies have shown positive effects on speech, more research is needed for FDA approval, a process hampered by the drug's low profitability for pharmaceutical companies.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" in the U.S. have increased by 70%. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria carrying a gene known as NDM, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers noted a more than fivefold increase in NDM cases in recent years, a trend they called "a grave danger." The misuse of antibiotics, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, is cited as a major contributing factor to the surge in antimicrobial resistance.</p>

Following their discussion, Trump posted on social media that he believes Ukraine, with European support, is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede territory. While the statement was met with cautious optimism in Ukraine, it remains unclear if this rhetorical change will translate into a concrete policy pivot from the White House.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old protester in Epping, UK, has been fined £276 for refusing a police order to remove his balaclava during a demonstration outside a hotel housing asylum seekers. When asked to remove the face covering, the man, Joshua Meadows, reportedly questioned why he could not wear it when others could wear burkas. He pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the police order and to a separate charge of cannabis possession. The protest was one of several held at the location following a sexual assault committed by an asylum seeker housed at the hotel.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low following a Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to carefully consider their financial situation before entering the market. Experts suggest buyers first determine the actual interest rate they are eligible for based on their credit score, as it may differ from the national average. They should also explore alternatives like buying mortgage points or using an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to secure an even lower initial rate. Finally, buyers must weigh the risk of waiting for rates to fall further against the possibility that they could rise again, as has happened in the recent past. (not investment advice)</p>

While the ZDX is being discontinued, Honda will continue its partnership with GM on another EV, the Honda Prologue, assembled in Mexico.

He also claimed the UK has abandoned its North Sea oil reserves due to high taxes, despite regulators projecting that 90% of future production will come from existing fields. The windfall tax on oil and gas profits, which Trump criticized, was implemented by the Conservative government to address bumper profits following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary has launched an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments, following a BBC investigation. The report found that some migrants were being taken on long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment that reportedly cost the Home Office £600. While asylum seekers receive a weekly bus pass, taxis are routinely booked for other necessary travel without public transport being offered as an alternative. The practice has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum as a wasteful use of taxpayer money.</p>
