          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reassured investors during an earnings call that the company could emerge stronger from the current tariff environment, citing its broad selection, low pricing, and speedy delivery. Jassy drew parallels to the Covid-19 pandemic, where Amazon gained market share despite economic uncertainty. The comments followed Amazon's first-quarter earnings report, which beat expectations, but its operating income forecast for the current period came in light due to tariff and trade policies. CFO Brian Olsavsky acknowledged the ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's sweeping tariffs, leading to a wider guidance range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Block (XYZ) reported first-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, with a disappointing outlook causing the stock to tumble 15% in extended trading. The company cited a more dynamic macro environment, including the impact of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, as reasons for a more cautious stance. While gross profit rose 9%, it still missed analysts' forecasts, and gross payment volume also came in light. Despite these challenges, CFO Amrita Ahuja highlighted that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, reflecting continued discipline and efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

Cook noted that tariffs are expected to add $900 million to Apple's costs for the current quarter, assuming no new tariffs or other major changes occur. Apple is already sourcing about half of its iPhones for the U.S. from India and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than those from China.

The charges stem from an incident in February 2024, when mercury was spilled inside an SUV at a car wash Kulikoff owned. Authorities allege that Kulikoff conspired to move the contaminated vehicle outside the city to the Kern County town of Boron. If convicted, Kulikoff faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for conspiracy to transport hazardous waste.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported a steep sales drop at U.S. restaurants in its first-quarter earnings report, citing economic uncertainty and diminished consumer sentiment, representing the largest decline since the COVID-19 pandemic. CEO Chris Kempczinski attributed the decline to "heightened anxiety" about the economy, largely driven by tariffs, which is weighing on lower-income Americans. The company noted a sharper-than-anticipated drop in traffic to U.S. restaurants. The company remains cautious about the overall health of the consumer.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the new health secretary, plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines, a move the administration calls a "radical departure" aimed at providing straightforward public health information. Experts, however, note that new vaccines already undergo placebo-controlled trials. The HHS has not specified which vaccines would be included, though updated COVID-19 shots are being considered, which vaccine experts fear could slow down vaccine access. Experts suggest that requiring placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly, and drug makers could forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether.</p>

          <p>Despite objections from Governor Gavin Newsom, Democratic state lawmakers in California approved changes to a bill that removed tougher penalties for soliciting 16- or 17-year-olds for sex. The action followed a heated debate, with Republicans accusing Democrats of being soft on sex offenders and Democrats expressing concerns about enhanced punishments potentially targeting children in LGBT or interracial relationships. The bill, AB 379, originally included a provision extending the same punishment for soliciting minors under 16 to suspects soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds.</p>

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the cost of AI for customers will come down over time, partly due to Amazon's custom chips. AWS has diversified away from China for components in the past six years.</p>
