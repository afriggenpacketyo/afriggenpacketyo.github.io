The United States, Germany, and Italy are the primary suppliers of arms to Israel, with the US providing the majority.

Germany's commitment to Israel's security complicates the prospect of an arms embargo, posing a challenge for the European Union.</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, creator of "Succession," has released a new movie, "Mountainhead," a satire of the tech right, premiering on HBO. The film, written and shot quickly, captures a sense of "nowness," focusing on tech oligarchs in Utah who create deepfakes that destabilize global reality. The story follows three billionaires who contemplate taking over failing nations and eventually consider a coup in the U.S. The movie explores themes of unchecked power, technofeudalism, and the influence of Silicon Valley on society.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are hopeful for a swift resolution to the trade war with the US after President Trump delayed imposing 50% tariffs until July 9. The delay follows a call between Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, where they agreed to fast-track trade negotiations. The EU's "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table. However, Trump's previous flip-flopping on border taxes has left businesses uncertain, and existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in effect.</p>
