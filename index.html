            <h2>OPEC Reduces Oil Demand Forecast Amid Trump's Trade War Uncertainties</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 12:07:05 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>OPEC has lowered its oil demand growth forecast for 2025 and 2026, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs on global economic growth. The cartel now projects a demand increase of 1.3 million barrels per day for both years, a decrease of approximately 150,000 bpd from previous estimates. This adjustment reflects concerns about trade-related dynamics introducing uncertainty into the short-term global economic outlook, as Trump's tariffs on China and other countries weigh heavily on prices. Despite the lowered demand forecast, key OPEC+ members have agreed to accelerate oil production starting in May, contributing to a decline in crude oil futures since the tariff announcement.

            <p>US stock markets opened higher on Monday after the White House announced a temporary tariff rollback on Chinese-made smartphones and some other electronics devices. This decision, which exempts these goods from the 145% levy imposed under Trump's new trade regime, spurred gains in European markets as well. Apple's share price saw a significant rise, driven by the fact that a large portion of its iPhones intended for sale in the US are manufactured in China. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all experienced gains in early trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Steve Bray, known as "Stop Brexit man", was found not guilty of failing to follow a police order after playing music on loudspeakers during a protest outside Parliament in London. Bray argued that playing music was part of his fundamental right to protest, and the judge agreed, stating that Bray believes he has an important message to disseminate and needs the volume to get it across. The incident occurred before then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was questioned by MPs in the House of Commons on 20 March last year. Bray is known for playing loud music at protests in Westminster, including D:Ream's Things Can Only Get Better at the gates of Downing Street when Sunak announced the general election last May.</p>

The families have sent a letter to the Justice Secretary, urging the government to ensure Abedi cannot harm anyone else, emphasizing that he should not have access to items that can be weaponized. In response, inmates of separation centers have been barred from using kitchens, highlighting concerns about security and privileges afforded to dangerous prisoners.</p>

The dispute centers around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles, which the union argues will result in significant pay cuts for workers. The city council declared a major incident due to the accumulation of rubbish on the streets, leading to public health concerns. Military planners and neighboring authorities have been called in to assist with waste clearance, but the strike remains unresolved, with residents reporting an increase in vermin and expressing concerns about the ongoing disruption.</p>

            <p>Campaigners with Canada’s Liberal party planted “stop the steal” buttons at a conservative conference to link the Conservative party to Donald Trump. Two Liberal party staffers infiltrated the Canada Strong and Free Network Conference (CSFN) in Ottawa and strategically placed provocative buttons designed to create the false impression that Conservative supporters of party leader Pierre Poilievre were embracing Trump-style rhetoric. The Liberal party confirmed the incident, saying some campaigners had “regrettably got carried away” with buttons “poking fun” at reported Conservative infighting. The incident comes in the final stretch of a heated campaign only weeks away from elections, in which the Liberals who hold a polling lead have consistently sought to characterize Poilievre as Canada’s version of Trump.</p>

According to Khan, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, acquired these companies to stifle their astronomical growth and maintain its dominance in the social networking market. The FTC is currently pursuing a trial to determine whether Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp constituted a monopoly, potentially leading to the divestiture of the two companies. Meta disputes the FTC's allegations and maintains that it does not have a monopoly in the social networking market.</p>

            <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that "more than 10" countries have made "very good, amazing" trade deal offers to the United States after President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on imports from many nations. Hassett also said there is no chance at all — "100% not" — that the U.S. will experience a recession in 2025. He denied there was any insider trading by Trump or White House officials ahead of the president's monthslong pause in so-called reciprocal tariffs Wednesday. Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are mulling whether offers of trade pacts from other countries are "good enough," Hassett said in the interview.

            <p>Airlines are increasingly focusing on wealthier leisure travelers to offset concerns about a slowing economy and weaker demand. Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines have pulled their 2025 outlooks, citing a murky U.S. economic picture and weaker near-term demand. Airline CEOs are warning about slowing bookings, including weaker corporate travel, citing President Donald Trump's trade war, mass government layoffs, fewer visitors from Canada and other countries, and more recently, weaker demand for domestic coach seats as price-sensitive consumers grow skittish about planning trips. Airlines are adding premium seating and expanding airport lounges, hoping wealthier travelers will continue to splurge despite economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Brazilian doctors said Monday that former President Jair Bolsonaro is conscious and remains in intensive care following a 12-hour surgery for a bowel obstruction the day prior. The far-right leader was hospitalized due to problems related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen in September 2018. Doctors at the DF Star Hospital said in a press conference in Brasilia that they do not expect to discharge Bolsonaro this week. The former president is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil's Supreme Court for allegedly attempting to stage a coup in January, 2023, with riots led by his supporters in Brasilia.</p>

It includes a diverse selection of top cases for the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max at a variety of price points. The iPhone 16 Series has a new camera layout and a programmable action button, meaning cases from previous models won’t fit. The new camera control button is touch-sensitive, and case manufacturers offer varying degrees of exposure to the button, with some cases having cutouts for it and others covering the button while maintaining the button's touch sensitivity. In my mini review for each case, I've noted how each model allows you to access the camera control button.</p>

            <p>The World Health Organization has described the conditions at hospitals in Gaza as "beyond description" following recent Israeli attacks. A major facility was put out of service by an Israeli air strike. WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC it was seeing "attack after attack" on hospitals and healthcare workers, and medical supplies were critically low due to Israel's blockade of the territory. On Sunday, staff at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City said an Israeli strike had destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care.</p>

Along with concerns over a higher cost of living came a surge in worries over the labor market: The probability that the unemployment rate would be higher a year from now surged to 44%, a move up of 4.6 percentage points and the highest level going back to the early Covid pandemic days of April 2020.

While initially framed as a consortium with BlackRock, TiL will now hold the majority share, with BlackRock only taking a 51% stake in two ports along the Panama Canal. This strategic acquisition significantly expands MSC's control over the maritime chessboard, with TiL's reach now spanning 31 countries.

Kugblenu argues that the joke's premise is flawed, as British people have ample access to fluoride, and that the focus on Wood's teeth reveals more about American beauty standards than about Wood herself. Ultimately, the comedian concludes that the skit missed its target and failed as satire.</p>
