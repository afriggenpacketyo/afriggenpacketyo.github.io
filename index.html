          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 23:13:30 EDT</div>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has confirmed a massive $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, effective from July 2024 through the end of 2033. The company has not disclosed the identity of its partner, citing a confidentiality request to protect trade secrets. This long-term deal is a significant boost for Samsung's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies and competes directly with industry leader TSMC. The news comes as Samsung aims to advance its 2-nanometer technology and has caused its shares to rise, despite recent struggles to meet AI-related demand.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal, establishing a 15% tariff on many European exports to the US, a figure lower than the threatened 30% but higher than previous rates. The agreement is being presented as a significant victory for the Trump administration, which also secured commitments for the EU to purchase more American energy and arms. For the EU, the deal avoids a more damaging trade war and provides stability, though it represents a notable concession on tariff levels. The agreement also sets the stage for upcoming US trade negotiations with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Google Admits Its Alert System Failed to Warn Millions During 2023 Turkey Earthquake</h2>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system significantly failed during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, underestimating the quake's magnitude. Instead of sending a high-level "Take Action" alert to ten million people in the immediate vicinity, only 469 such warnings were dispatched for the initial 7.8 magnitude tremor. The system's algorithms misjudged the quake's strength, leading to less urgent "Be Aware" notifications for most. Google has since updated its algorithm, stating that a simulation with the new changes would have correctly alerted all ten million users at risk.</p>

          <p>In a poignant essay, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler reflected on the band's final performance with Ozzy Osbourne just weeks before the singer's death. Butler described being shocked by how "frail" Osbourne appeared during rehearsals, needing assistance to move and singing while seated in a chair. The farewell show, a major tribute event, culminated in Osbourne performing from a throne on stage. Butler expressed gratitude for the final concert but lamented the strange, somewhat distant ending to their 57-year friendship, noting it was a privilege to share the stage one last time.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, a move that could lead to strike action later in the year. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque," highlighting that it is lower than the pay rises awarded to other public sector workers like doctors and teachers. With a high turnout expected in its consultative vote, the RCN is demanding that the government enter negotiations over the summer to avert a formal strike ballot. Another health workers' union, GMB, has also already voted to reject the same pay deal.</p>

          <p>Top medical groups, including the American Medical Association, are voicing "deep concern" over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This independent panel of experts provides crucial, evidence-based guidelines for primary care, from cancer screenings to managing chronic diseases. The potential move follows the recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, raising fears that the USPSTF could also be filled with political appointees lacking necessary expertise. Critics warn that such an action could erode trust in medical guidelines and disrupt patient care nationwide.</p>

          <p>An economic model from The Observatory of Economic Complexity forecasts a significant reconfiguration of global trade following the new US-EU tariff agreement. The Tariff Simulator predicts that by 2027, global exports to the U.S. could drop by over 46% compared to recent averages, while U.S. exports are projected to rise. The model suggests that the 15% tariff framework will cause countries to rewire trade relationships away from the U.S., with China, Canada, and Mexico seeing the largest decreases in exports to America. Logistics experts warn that the tariffs will make many products more expensive, potentially reducing product diversity for U.S. consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's political landscape is experiencing a significant shift with the surge of the far-right Sanseito party, which increased its parliamentary seats from one to fifteen. The party's "Japanese First" platform, echoing Donald Trump's rhetoric, has capitalized on public frustration over a sluggish economy, inflation, and stagnant wages. This discontent is compounded by rising anti-immigrant and anti-tourist sentiment, as the country grapples with a record number of foreign residents and issues of tourist behavior. Analysts suggest this populist movement challenges the long-standing dominance of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and marks a new, more volatile era in Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations—Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Lucia—are experiencing a significant increase in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, largely fueled by Americans. These programs allow individuals to gain a passport by purchasing real estate, with minimum investments starting around $200,000. Estate agents and investment migration experts report that political and social volatility in the U.S. is driving many to seek a "plan B" passport, which offers visa-free travel to over 150 countries. While controversial, these programs are a major source of revenue for the island nations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a trade agreement at Trump's golf resort in Scotland, narrowly avoiding a larger trade war. The deal establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the US, half the rate Trump had threatened, while a 50% tariff on steel remains. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to investing $600 billion in the US and purchasing $750 billion in American energy products. Both leaders hailed the deal as a major achievement that brings stability, though it marks a significant concession from the EU's pre-Trump tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights cases of imported dogs arriving with serious behavioral issues or infectious diseases like Brucella canis, which can be transmitted to humans.

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the brilliant and influential musical satirist known for his witty and incisive songs in the 1950s and 60s, has died at the age of 97.

He famously retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his career as a mathematics lecturer. His work, which blended dark humor with sharp social critique, inspired generations of comedians and songwriters, including "Weird Al" Yankovic, who called him a "living musical hero."</p>

Excavations have unearthed a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts dating back to 580 BCE. Experts from the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department argue these findings challenge the long-held narrative of a northern-centric origin for Indian civilization and literacy. The claims have turned the site into a symbol of Tamil pride and identity, fueling a north-south political divide and leading to accusations that the federal government is attempting to suppress the findings.</p>

The cuts have shuttered a cultural center, decimated the staff at the National Archive of Remembrance, and halted subsidies, threatening decades of work on truth, memory, and justice for the estimated 30,000 people who were "disappeared."</p>

They tracked the plane to the United States, obtained its flight logs, and used them to prove its use in the murder of a group of activists and French nuns in 1977. This evidence was crucial in convicting the pilots and has returned the plane to Argentina as a chilling witness to state terrorism.</p>

The complex structure of the conglomerate may be difficult for the market to value, and the stock may be suffering from a lack of direct exposure to the currently popular data center sector.
