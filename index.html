          <h2>Record-Breaking Wisconsin Supreme Court Election: A Litmus Test for Trump and Musk?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court election, the most expensive judicial race in US history, is seen as a key indicator of public sentiment towards President Trump's second term.  The race pits Republican-backed Brad Schimel against Democrat-backed Susan Crawford, with significant financial backing from Elon Musk supporting Schimel.  The outcome will influence the court's ideological leanings and its decisions on crucial issues like abortion access and redistricting, potentially impacting the balance of power in Congress.  Musk's involvement raises concerns about the influence of money in judicial elections and the potential impact on democratic processes.</p>
