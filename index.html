          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. would cease bombing Houthi rebels in Yemen, stating the group had pledged to halt attacks on American ships in the Red Sea; however, Houthi leadership stated that they would 'evaluate' the proposal before agreeing. The announcement followed weeks of U.S. airstrikes in Yemen, prompted by Houthi attacks on vessels they claimed were connected to Israel's allies. The U.S. military has suffered losses during the conflict, including drones and a fighter jet, and the administration faced scrutiny over its planning of the attacks. The situation remains fluid as the Houthis evaluate the U.S. proposal and the long-term implications for regional stability are assessed.</p>

Despite tensions on trade and borders, Carney expressed a commitment to standing firm against the U.S. president and urged him to cease referring to Canada as the 51st state.

          <p>A New York Times article details an antisemitic incident at a Philadelphia bar owned by Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, where a customer arranged letter boards into an offensive message targeting Jewish people. The incident occurred amid a record high in antisemitic episodes in the United States, as reported by the Anti-Defamation League. Temple University suspended a student believed to be involved, and the bar fired employees deemed responsible. Portnoy, who is Jewish, initially expressed outrage before offering to send the individuals on a tour of Auschwitz, later revoking the offer for one student who allegedly denied involvement.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration, allowing the Pentagon's transgender military ban to take effect while legal challenges continue.

Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, while the White House celebrated the decision as a victory for military readiness. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups condemned the ruling, asserting that the ban is discriminatory and unrelated to military effectiveness, and will be devastating for transgender service members.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of 12% despite the company's ongoing revenue growth acceleration, as analysts raised concerns about a decline in international revenue. CEO Alex Karp defended the company's performance, stating that Palantir is "pretty happy" and will continue to partner with the world's best people. While Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and increased its revenue guidance for the year, analysts attributed the stock's decline to the company's high software multiple and the potential for compression as revenue growth slows. Karp remains optimistic, highlighting the company's 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S. as drivers of its success.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to enforce a ban on transgender troops serving in the military, overturning lower court rulings. The court's decision was brief and unsigned, providing no specific reasoning. The three liberal justices dissented.

The judge said that he considers pro-Palestinian advocacy and criticism of the state of Israel, as well as antisemitism, free speech because hate speech is not prohibited under the First Amendment.

Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" and used real estate analogies to shut down the debate. However, when discussing tariffs, Carney struggled to interject, displaying visible frustration through clenched jaws and silent mouthing of "never, never." The analysis suggests that while the meeting was more cordial than expected, tensions remained evident in Carney's non-verbal cues.</p>
