          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has proposed suspending the agency's influential monthly jobs report. Antoni, from the conservative Heritage Foundation, criticized the report for its frequent revisions, suggesting a shift to more accurate but less timely quarterly data. The move follows the president's dismissal of the previous commissioner over data revisions he found disappointing. The White House affirmed its goal is to provide trustworthy data, while experts note that declining survey response rates have made timely economic reporting more challenging.

The meeting precedes a planned in-person summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy has indicated that Russia may be signaling a readiness to discuss ending the war, but he remains wary, stating that Russian military movements suggest preparations for new offensives rather than a move toward peace. Trump has described his upcoming meeting with Putin as a "feel-out meeting" to determine if a deal to end the war is possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, suggesting he should replace his chief economist or focus on his side career as a DJ. The rebuke came after a Goldman Sachs research note, led by economist Jan Hatzius, predicted that American consumers would bear an increasing share of the costs from the administration's tariffs. Trump disputed this, claiming on social media that tariffs are primarily paid by foreign governments and companies, bringing substantial revenue to the U.S. Treasury. The president asserted the bank's economic predictions have been consistently wrong.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are projecting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This estimated increase is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025 and is intended to help benefits keep pace with rising prices. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration using inflation data from July, August, and September, with the final figure typically announced in October. The projection reflects a 2.7% annual rise in the consumer price index as of July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to address crime in Washington, D.C., by federalizing the city's police, deploying the National Guard, and using federal officers. However, his authority is limited by the Home Rule Act, which caps such a takeover at 30 days without congressional approval. D.C.'s attorney general has called the move unlawful, citing that crime rates are at a 30-year low despite a post-pandemic spike. While the police union welcomed the move, critics argue it's a symbolic exercise of power that overlooks the complexities of municipal governance and may not achieve its stated goals.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine, a location chosen for its historic ties as former Russian territory. The summit follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, including setting a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is not expected to attend but will be briefed afterward, though he has expressed concern over any deal made without his country's input. The meeting aims to be a "feel-out" session, with Trump hoping to persuade Putin to end the conflict, potentially through territorial swaps.</p>

This article compares the potential earnings between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account. While a high-yield savings account may offer a higher initial rate, its variable nature means earnings could fluctuate if market rates fall. In contrast, a CD provides a fixed, guaranteed return for a set term, potentially earning more over six-month or one-year periods, offering stability against market volatility for risk-averse savers.

          <p>England is currently in its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 33°C (92.1°F) in London. This prolonged period of hot, dry weather has led to what the national drought group calls "nationally significant" water shortfalls. The shortages are causing widespread environmental damage, impacting farms, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk, with millions now under hosepipe bans. While the public is becoming more aware of heat-related health risks, the conditions are also disrupting rail services and raising concerns about a potentially catastrophic harvest for farmers across the country.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash, are presented as a tool for seniors needing to supplement their retirement income. While these loans are federally regulated and can provide financial flexibility without monthly payments, they are not without risks. Borrowers must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance to avoid default. The loan balance grows over time, which can significantly deplete the home's equity, impacting potential inheritance. The article advises that these loans are safest for seniors who plan to remain in their homes long-term. (not investment advice)</p>
