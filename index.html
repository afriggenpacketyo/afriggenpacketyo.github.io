          <h2>Stevie Wonder, at 75, Affirms He Will Never Retire From Music</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:15:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the age of 75, music legend Stevie Wonder has declared he has no plans to retire, stating he will continue playing as long as he is breathing. This comes after a well-received UK tour and confirms his ongoing work on a new album, "Through The Eyes Of Wonder," his first since 2005. Wonder views his songs as timeless statements from his spirit and sees performing them as essential as breathing. The article also touches on his role as a civil rights advocate, with Wonder expressing concern that America is currently experiencing a regressive trend, though he remains hopeful that people will awaken to the truth.</p>

          <h2>Insiders Reveal UK's High-Speed Rail Project Was Inherently Flawed From Its Inception</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 19:03:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project is described as a prime example of project mismanagement, now billions over budget and years behind schedule. Insiders and analysts suggest the project was doomed by a combination of factors, including an overly ambitious goal for speed that dramatically increased costs and complexity. The article explores how the UK's unique geography as a small, densely populated island, combined with a democratic system requiring extensive public consultation and political compromise, created immense financial and logistical hurdles. These systemic challenges, from negotiating with property owners to navigating a complex planning system, raise questions about the feasibility of large-scale infrastructure projects in the country.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 116-year history, Girlguiding has introduced a new set of 72 badges to keep the organization relevant to modern girls' interests. The new additions were developed with input from over 20,000 girls and volunteers and include contemporary activities and skills. Badges now available range from 'laughter' and 'bee rescuer' for the youngest members to 'fandoms' for Rangers interested in pop culture like Taylor Swift, and 'booktivist' for learning about empowerment through reading. The update aims to build confidence and address current issues while maintaining the organization's core values of fun and education outside of school.</p>

          <p>The UK government has officially confirmed a national inquiry into the 'Battle of Orgreave,' one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers clashing with striking miners at a coking plant in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what she called "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the news, hoping it will finally bring truth and justice to the affected mining communities.</p>

          <p>Once overshadowed by tequila, artisanal mezcal is now a booming half-billion-dollar industry, gaining prominence in high-end bars and restaurants worldwide. The spirit, primarily produced in Oaxaca, Mexico, is crafted by hand in a traditional process by family-owned distilleries, or palenques. The article highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros who, after migrating to the U.S. for work, returned to Mexico to expand their family business. Their partnership with American entrepreneur John Rexer and a subsequent acquisition by Bacardi has transformed their local operation into a global success, benefiting their entire community.</p>

          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game broadcast, ESPN host Elle Duncan made an off-color joke about the lack of defense, comparing it to a "girls' trip to Cancun" where there is "no D." The comment drew immediate on-air reactions from her colleagues and subsequently generated a mixed response on social media. Some viewers criticized the remark as unprofessional, while others defended it as harmless humor. The incident occurred at halftime of the high-scoring game, which ultimately saw Napheesa Collier's team defeat Caitlin Clark's team 151-131. Clark did not participate in the game due to a nagging groin injury.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Price of Children," reveals a Vatican-run program from 1950 to 1970 that sent approximately 3,500 Italian children to the U.S. for adoption under the guise of being orphans. In reality, most were the children of unwed mothers who were pressured or deceived into relinquishing them, with many believing the placement was temporary. The investigation found that the church often falsified documents, declaring the children abandoned to make them eligible for U.S. orphan visas. The article shares the painful stories of adoptees who later discovered their mothers never consented to their adoption and the lifelong trauma caused by the separation.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler is drawing frequent comparisons to Tiger Woods for his dominant performance in men's golf. This article analyzes how the 29-year-old has become the sport's undisputed leader, winning four majors in the last four seasons and demonstrating a machine-like consistency. His success is attributed to a combination of a calm, mechanical mindset, unorthodox but effective technique, and a significant improvement in his putting after consulting with English coach Phil Kenyon. Peers like Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele acknowledge Scheffler as the new benchmark in golf, achieving a level of supremacy that many thought would not be seen again so soon after Woods's era.</p>

Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, condemned the decision as a destructive act that will cripple the agency's ability to use science in protecting public health and safety.

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships asserts that the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection," the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, authentic confidence, and protects mental health. It suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, undermining this connection. The author provides practical advice for parents, such as validating emotions, welcoming a child's full self without judgment, and modeling their own emotional awareness to build a strong internal foundation in their children.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to create a new water ombudsman to serve as a single, empowered point of contact for consumer complaints against water companies. This new consumer champion will have legal powers to address issues such as leaks, incorrect billing, and other disputes. The move is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces intense public scrutiny over rising bills and a record number of sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030, signaling significant reforms to come for the industry and its regulator, Ofwat.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Australia is actively undermining its own diplomatic efforts to stabilize its relationship with China. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China was portrayed positively by Chinese media, the author contends that simultaneous actions by his government send a contradictory message. Specifically, the threat to force the sale of the Chinese-leased Darwin Port is highlighted as a self-sabotaging move. The author suggests such actions create uncertainty and damage the trust necessary for Chinese investors to view Australia as a reliable partner, thereby negating the intended goodwill of the diplomatic visit.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described the atmosphere in her city as one of widespread fear due to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. In an interview, she stated that ICE raids have made many residents, including legal residents and citizens, afraid to leave their homes, impacting local businesses and community life. Bass heavily criticized the tactics used by federal agents, describing "masked men in unmarked cars" snatching people off the street, which she likened to kidnappings. She also condemned the deployment of the National Guard to the city as a misuse of taxpayer money and an unnecessary show of force that was never requested.</p>

In a Truth Social post, Trump called the story "typically untruthful," asserting his own expertise by stating, "Nobody had to explain that to me.
