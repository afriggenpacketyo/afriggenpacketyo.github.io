          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political entity, the "America Party," following a poll on his social media platform, X. He suggested the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, acting as a deciding vote between the two major parties. This move comes after a public falling out with Donald Trump, despite Musk being a major donor to his 2024 campaign, and amid Musk's vocal opposition to a recent five-trillion-dollar spending bill. The party does not yet appear to be registered with the Federal Election Committee.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and subsequently released from the hospital after responding to a call at an ICE detention facility on July 4th. Authorities report that over a dozen masked individuals in black, some wearing body armor, vandalized the facility and used fireworks to lure law enforcement into an ambush. Several armed suspects were taken into custody after a chase, with a federal source indicating eight people were arrested. The Department of Justice is closely monitoring the incident, vowing to prosecute those responsible for assaults on federal officers or property.</p>

          <p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited Syria to engage with the new Islamic-led government that replaced the Assad regime. Lammy stated his purpose was to urge the new leadership towards inclusivity, transparency, and accountability, emphasizing the UK's desire for a peaceful transition. This visit follows the lifting of sanctions by the US and UK, part of a broader Western effort to reset relations. Despite concerns over recent violent attacks on minority groups and the government's authoritarian direction, Lammy asserted that UK engagement and humanitarian aid aim to support stability and a more inclusive future for all Syrian communities.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 32 fatalities, including 14 children, in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, where more than two dozen campers remain missing. Hundreds of people have been rescued, many by helicopter from trees, as emergency crews continue search operations. Local officials expressed shock at the flood's ferocity, stating that the rainfall far exceeded what was forecasted by the National Weather Service.</p>

This marks a potential shift from their long-held "no draws" mantra.

This criticism comes as the NWS faces nationwide funding cuts and staffing shortages, including a vacant key warning coordination meteorologist position in the local San Antonio office.

The highly unconventional autobiography was not written but dictated over four years, allowing him to speak freely on any topic without fear of hurting those he knew. The work, which editors at UC Berkeley have labored for years to reconstruct, contains his uncensored thoughts on everything from President Theodore Roosevelt to his own family's heartbreak. Twain's 100-year embargo was intended to free him from social constraints and, as experts note, also served as a brilliant, long-term marketing strategy.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire, burning in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, has grown to nearly 80,000 acres, making it the largest wildfire in California so far this year. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, has forced over 200 people to evacuate and threatens about 50 structures. Fueled by heat and wind, the fire is primarily impacting the Carrizo Plain National Monument, a habitat for several endangered species. Over 600 firefighters are battling the fire as concerns grow over an impending heat wave expected to bring triple-digit temperatures to Southern California, further elevating fire risk.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing criticism from Jewish groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" during a rally in Iowa. While celebrating his new budget bill, Trump referred to some bankers as "Shylocks and bad people." The term originates from the ruthless Jewish moneylender in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware the term was considered offensive. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the slur "very troubling and irresponsible," as it evokes centuries-old stereotypes about Jewish people and greed.</p>

          <p>Colombian authorities have arrested Elder José Arteaga Hernández, the alleged mastermind behind the June 7th assassination attempt on conservative senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe. Uribe was shot twice in the head during a campaign rally in Bogota and remains in intensive care. Arteaga, who has a long criminal history, is accused of coordinating the attack and hiring a minor to carry out the shooting. The attack has been widely condemned, with U.S. officials blaming "violent leftist rhetoric" and calling it a direct threat to Colombia's democracy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How Billionaires Pay Lower Effective Tax Rates Than the Middle Class</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 13:01:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis prompted by a query to ChatGPT reveals that while the wealthiest Americans pay a similar or higher income tax rate on paper, their overall effective tax burden is often lower than that of the middle class. The key difference lies in how wealth is taxed versus how labor is taxed. Billionaires derive most of their financial gains from appreciating assets like stocks, which are only taxed upon sale. They leverage strategies like "buy-borrow-die," where they take out tax-free loans against their assets to fund their lifestyle, effectively avoiding taxes on their wealth's growth.

          <p>The arrest of boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. by U.S. authorities has sent ripples of unease through his hometown of Culiacan, the heart of the Sinaloa Cartel's territory. While Chávez Jr. was arrested for immigration violations, U.S. officials also highlighted an active Mexican warrant for him on trafficking charges and alleged ties to the cartel. In Culiacan, where his legendary father is an idol, the news is discussed in hushed tones. The public linking of the famous boxing family to organized crime has unsettled a city already tense from a recent internal cartel feud.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) is under fire for sending an email claiming President Trump's new spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled this "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, phased-out deduction for seniors. Opponents argue the email is a politicization of a previously apolitical agency, using partisan language to mislead the public about the bill's actual effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>One Year into Power, UK Labour Voters Express Disappointment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 12:11:02 EDT</div>

          <p>A focus group of voters who supported the UK's Labour Party in the 2024 election reveals a strong sense of disappointment after one year of the party being in government. Participants from Kent, who were key to Labour's victory, felt the party has not delivered on its promises, particularly on immigration, and expressed frustration over repeated policy U-turns. While some were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of turning the country around in a year, others felt "lied to." The sentiment reflects a souring relationship with the electorate and suggests growing interest in rival parties like Reform UK.</p>
