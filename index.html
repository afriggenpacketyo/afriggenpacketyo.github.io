          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing travel bans and restrictions on nationals from 12 countries, citing national security concerns. The order affects Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with additional restrictions for Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The White House claims these restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, referencing a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, as an example of the dangers posed by inadequately vetted foreign nationals. Exemptions exist for athletes, visa holders for persecuted minorities, Afghan nationals with Special Immigrant Visas, and lawful permanent residents of the U.S., and the order has faced immediate condemnation from Democrats and human rights groups.</p>

          <p>China has approved the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, marking a significant milestone for the country's aviation ambitions. This development occurs amid increasing U.S. export restrictions targeting China's access to key technologies. While this engine differs from those used in commercial jets, experts say its development reflects China's growing ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines. Li Gaiqi, the chief designer of the AES100, emphasized the importance of this achievement for China's aviation sector.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that leprosy existed in the Americas long before European explorers arrived, challenging previous beliefs that the disease was solely introduced by settlers. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur discovered that Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a second species of bacteria, was responsible for leprosy in the Americas, with evidence suggesting it existed 1,000 years prior to European contact. This revelation changes the understanding of leprosy's history in the Americas, proving it was endemic among Indigenous populations. The study, which involved analyzing over 800 DNA samples from ancient human remains and recent medical cases, also suggests the possibility of unknown animal reservoirs for the disease.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of Judi Lynn Weinstein and Gad Haggai, two Israeli-American hostages killed during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. The remains were found in Khan Younis, Gaza, following a special operation based on precise intelligence. Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed condolences to the families, stating that the couple were killed in the initial terrorist attack and taken into Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades. The recovery brings closure to the families but underscores the ongoing plight of remaining hostages held in Gaza, as efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage release remain deadlocked.</p>

          <p>Divorce lawyers report a seasonal pattern in filings, with peaks in late summer and early spring, while December and January see a significant drop. This trend is attributed to families delaying proceedings during holidays and summer vacations to minimize disruption for children. A study from the University of Washington supports this, finding divorce filings consistently peak in March and August, driven by a "domestic ritual" calendar. While some experts dismiss sentimental reasons, others note increasing rates of "gray divorces" among people over 50, often driven by women's increased financial independence.</p>

          <p>A recent EU drug report highlights a concerning trend of increasing synthetic drug use in Europe, with many substances now being produced locally. Synthetic stimulants like cathinones are gaining popularity, but the long-term health risks remain largely unknown due to their novelty and evolving nature. While cocaine remains Europe's most popular illicit drug, polysubstance use is a leading cause of drug deaths. The report also notes a rise in deadly synthetic opioids like fentanyl and nitazenes, exacerbated by the ban on opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, prompting calls for more drug checking services.</p>
