          <p>According to U.S. officials, Hamas' response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire agreement is considered a setback, as it seeks changes to the guarantees for a permanent end to the war, which has been a major point of contention with Israel. The U.S. claims that Israel has already accepted the proposal. The core issue remains the terms for a lasting resolution to the conflict. The U.S. continues to push for proximity talks to begin immediately to close a 60-day ceasefire deal. The goal is to achieve a permanent ceasefire and sustained aid for Palestinians. </p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older, and for individuals aged 12 to 64 with health conditions that increase their risk from the coronavirus, but with restrictions on who can receive it. The vaccine uses a lower dose by refining its immune target, and it has been shown to be safe and at least as effective as Moderna's existing vaccine in a study of over 11,000 people. The decision to limit the vaccine's use reflects skepticism from some officials about broad vaccination recommendations. The CDC has also changed its recommendations for children's COVID-19 vaccination, citing a review of data regarding safety and benefits.</p>

          <p>During an Oval Office send-off marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration, Elon Musk lashed out when questioned about a New York Times report alleging his frequent use of ketamine. Musk dismissed the report and defended his work in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Times reported that Musk used ketamine as often as once a day in 2024. Musk claimed that he is not taking drugs, writing that he tried prescription ketamine a few years ago, but has not taken it since then.</p>
