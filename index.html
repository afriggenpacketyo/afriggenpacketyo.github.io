          <p>A high-ranking UN official has cautioned the Security Council against Israel's potential full reoccupation of the Gaza Strip, labeling it a 'deeply alarming' move with potentially catastrophic results. The warning comes amid reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing for a complete conquest, a plan that has reportedly caused division within Israel's own military leadership. The UN official stressed that such an expansion would endanger more Palestinian civilians and the remaining Israeli hostages, while reiterating that Gaza must be part of a future Palestinian state. The official also condemned the severe restrictions on humanitarian aid, highlighting the unfolding famine and rising death toll from malnutrition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that aligns with economists' expectations following a significant rate cut in June. This decision comes as India faces increased trade pressure from the U.S., with President Trump threatening higher tariffs over India's trade relations with Russia. While acknowledging resilient domestic growth, the RBI noted that the outlook for external demand remains uncertain due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and global financial market volatility. The central bank maintained its GDP growth forecast for the fiscal year but lowered its inflation projection, citing a more benign near-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan forward David Martínez was the star of the match, scoring two goals to secure a 2-1 victory for Los Angeles FC against Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty kick in the 38th minute and, after Tigres equalized, netted the game-winner with a skillful individual play. The result leaves the Mexican club, Tigres, on the verge of elimination from the tournament, as their advancement now depends on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes. Despite the win, LAFC's own chances of advancing to the next round remain slim due to their overall point tally.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in northern Mexico are facing severe economic hardship after the U.S. suspended live cattle imports due to concerns over the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. The ban, the third in eight months, has crippled a $1.2 billion export industry already weakened by years of severe drought. U.S. officials are taking measures to prevent the pest, which was eradicated in the U.S. decades ago, from spreading north, including plans to release billions of sterile flies in Mexico. Mexican ranchers are now forced to sell their cattle domestically at a significant loss and are exploring new ventures like beekeeping to survive the financial crisis.</p>

          <p>A sudden and extreme downpour, known as a cloudburst, has triggered devastating flash floods in the village of Dharali in India's northern state of Uttarakhand, leaving more than 100 people missing. The incident caused the Kheerganga river to swell, sending a massive wave of water and debris through the popular tourist area, submerging buildings and roads. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the extensive damage, continued heavy rainfall, and poor connectivity in the mountainous region. While around 130 people have been rescued from the wider Uttarkashi district, disaster response teams are struggling to reach the epicenter of the disaster.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has levied a 41% tariff on Syria, the highest rate for any country, just three months after lifting long-standing sanctions. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the move sends a powerful symbolic message and threatens to hinder Syria's desperately needed reconstruction after 13 years of civil war. The country is grappling with a collapsed infrastructure, ongoing violence, and the challenge of rebuilding under a new transitional government. Experts suggest the tariff could be a political tool to maintain leverage over Syria's new leadership, potentially pressuring them on issues like relations with Israel, rather than a meaningful economic policy.</p>

The Fever were playing without their star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury but remained an active presence from the bench. The Sparks' offense was led by Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson, who both scored 25 points, as the now-healthy LA team improved to eight wins in their last nine games. The game was briefly interrupted in the second quarter when a sex toy was thrown onto the court, an incident players and officials handled by quickly removing it and continuing play.</p>

The proposed legislation, which requires parliamentary approval, aims to control the supply of medications like puberty blockers and hormones for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. Under the new rules, such treatments would only be dispensed after approval by a national ethics committee, pending new protocols from the health ministry. The measure, which also establishes a national registry to monitor treatments, has been criticized by transgender rights advocates but is supported by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's conservative government.</p>

The scheme reportedly involved routing shipments through Singapore and Malaysia to conceal their final destination in China, violating U.S. export controls designed to limit Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology.

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered their largest annual decline in coral cover since record-keeping began nearly 40 years ago. The severe loss is attributed primarily to widespread coral bleaching caused by record heat stress from climate change, compounded by cyclones and outbreaks of coral-eating starfish. The report warns that the reef may be approaching a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events.

They point out that China's rate was a low 39.6% of GDP in 2023.

          <h2>Dodgers Rookie Pitcher Roki Sasaki Shows Progress in Recovery, Aiming for Late-Season Return</h2>

          <p>Dodgers' rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who was sidelined early in the season with a shoulder impingement, is showing encouraging signs of a comeback. After a disappointing start to his MLB career, the highly-touted Japanese phenom has been progressing in a throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and a new two-seam fastball added to his arsenal. The team is hopeful that he could return to the active roster by the end of August, potentially providing valuable pitching depth as a starter or reliever for their postseason push. While his contribution this year remains uncertain, his recent progress marks a positive turn for a player once seen as a long-term project.</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire, now the largest in California this year, has scorched nearly 84,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest and remains only 9% contained. The blaze, which started as several smaller fires, is threatening over 800 structures in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, forcing evacuations and injuring at least three people. Over 1,900 personnel are battling the fire, which is burning through steep, inaccessible terrain of chaparral and brushland. Officials are concerned that a forecast of hot and dry weather through the weekend will increase fire behavior and create more dangerous conditions for firefighters.</p>

          <p>Meta announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, has deleted over 6.8 million accounts in the first half of the year as part of a crackdown on global scam operations. Many of these accounts were linked to criminal centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to target individuals with fraudulent investment schemes and other scams. The company is also rolling out new security features, such as alerts when a user is added to a group by an unknown contact, to better protect users. In one instance, WhatsApp collaborated with OpenAI to disrupt a Cambodian group that was using ChatGPT to generate scam scripts for a pyramid scheme.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has instructed its army to create a plan to ensure that only state institutions possess weapons by the end of the year, a move that would effectively disarm the militant group Hezbollah. The decision, which follows pressure from the United States, is part of implementing a ceasefire agreement from November 2024 aimed at ending hostilities with Israel. Hezbollah, the only faction to retain its arms after the country's civil war, has been severely weakened by recent conflict but remains a powerful force. A Hezbollah leader has already rejected the plan, stating the group will not disarm while facing Israeli attacks.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter revenue of $7.69 billion, exceeding analyst expectations, but its adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents fell just short of estimates. The company's stock slid in after-hours trading following the announcement. While overall sales grew 32% year-over-year, AMD noted that its AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export restrictions that eliminated sales of its MI308 chip to China. Despite this setback, the company saw strong growth in its Client and Gaming segment and provided a sales forecast for the current quarter that is above market expectations.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program in April 2025. The judge stated that the transfer of funds could cause 'irreparable harm' to flood-prone areas that rely on the program for mitigation projects like stormwater management. The injunction blocks the government from repurposing the funds while the court fully considers the case against the program's termination.</p>

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem dubbed the new facility the 'Speedway Slammer,' stating it would house the 'worst of the worst' undocumented individuals.

          <p>A massive, state-backed Chinese copper mining project in Afghanistan's Logar province is reportedly making significant progress and could begin extraction this year, 17 years after the contract was first awarded. The Mes Aynak mine, one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits, has been stalled for years due to security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and a lack of infrastructure. The project's advancement signals a deepening of economic ties between Beijing and the Taliban-led government. To address historical concerns, officials have stated the mine will use a costlier underground mining process to better protect the valuable Buddhist relics at the site.</p>

Notably, the murder rate fell by nearly 15%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a record one-year drop of 18.6%.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units can be kept at 82 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler. The ordinance, aimed at protecting tenants from the growing danger of extreme heat waves, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to give property owners time to comply. Officials are encouraging landlords to use 'passive' cooling methods like reflective roofing and better windows, rather than just air conditioning. The law will be complaint-driven, with public health inspectors working with landlords to achieve compliance before issuing fines.</p>
