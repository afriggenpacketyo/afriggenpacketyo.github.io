          <p>The European Union is actively negotiating with the United States to prevent a new round of 30% tariffs scheduled for August 1. In preparation for a potential failure to reach a deal, the EU has devised a four-part strategy that includes preparing countermeasures and consulting with other nations affected by U.S. trade policies. As a potential compromise, the bloc is reportedly considering offering reciprocal tariff reductions on automobiles if the Trump administration lowers its own duties. The ongoing trade dispute creates significant economic uncertainty, given that the U.S. and EU share the world's largest bilateral trade relationship.</p>

          <p>HMP Pentonville in London has been put into special measures following a damning report from the chief inspector of prisons. The inspection revealed that the cockroach-infested facility had illegally detained numerous inmates past their release dates due to inaccurate sentence calculations. The report also highlighted "chaotic and even frightening conditions," with many prisoners confined to overcrowded cells for over 22 hours a day. The watchdog expressed grave concerns over poor oversight, especially given three recent suicides, prompting calls for urgent reform and investment.</p>

          <h2>European Union Agrees to New Sanctions Package, Lowering Price Cap on Russian Crude Oil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:39:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has approved its 18th sanctions package against Russia, notably including a lower price cap on Russian crude oil exports. This measure aims to further curtail Moscow's revenues, which are crucial for funding its war in Ukraine, while keeping Russian oil on the global market to prevent price shocks. The original G7-backed cap, set at $60 per barrel, restricted access to Western shipping and insurance services for buyers paying above the threshold. While the new price level was not explicitly stated, EU officials confirmed the reduction as part of a broader push to increase pressure on the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Sir Grant Shapps, the former UK defence secretary, has defended the government's decision to use a super-injunction to hide a major data breach involving thousands of Afghans who worked with Britain. He argued that the secrecy was justified to prevent individuals from being "pursued, murdered and executed" by the Taliban. The breach, which also exposed data of over 100 British officials, was discovered in August 2023 and led to a covert resettlement scheme for those affected. The Ministry of Defence has not disclosed how many people may have been harmed as a result of the leak.</p>

          <p>New regulations in the UK will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers starting next July. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority, aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees on what is currently an unregulated form of credit. While the new rules will provide consumers with more rights, such as access to the Financial Ombudsman, they will also likely result in some shoppers being denied credit. This is a significant step toward regulating a rapidly growing sector popular among young adults.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly incident at a Texas camp, experts are urging parents to question summer camps about their safety protocols for extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and wildfires. With minimal federal oversight and varied state-level regulations, the responsibility often falls on parents to vet a camp's preparedness. Key questions include a camp's strategies for heat mitigation, its location relative to floodplains, and its specific emergency action plans for evacuation and communication. Experts stress that generic assurances are insufficient and that detailed procedures for monitoring weather and alerting campers are crucial for ensuring child safety.</p>

A cross-party committee of MPs described the situation as "woeful," blaming years of underinvestment and weak regulation for the rampant sewage discharges.

In a letter to DHS and the State Department, lawmakers suggest the administration may have misled Congress and federal courts about the arrangement. Their concerns are based on recent court filings where El Salvador's government stated the detained migrants remain the "legal responsibility" of the U.S., contradicting U.S. claims.

Key to this adoption is a user-friendly national e-ID system and the "once-only principle," where citizens provide data to the government just once.

Trump has alleged, without evidence, that the files were doctored by Democrats, while also labeling the controversy a "hoax."

Trump has personally backed a surge in air defense systems for Ukraine, including up to 17 Patriot batteries, to counter Russian air barrages.

While an earlier demonstration was peaceful, a later group of protesters reportedly threw eggs, set off fireworks, and caused damage to the hotel. One officer sustained minor injuries, and police have begun identifying suspects using bodycam and drone footage. The protest, which was met by a smaller pro-refugee counter-demonstration, followed calls from local politicians to stop using the hotel for asylum seekers after an occupant was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce a bill that would lower the voting age to 16 for all UK elections, potentially adding 1.5 million new voters to the electorate. This change, a key Labour manifesto promise, would align national election rules with those already in place in Scotland and Wales. The move presents a new challenge for political parties, who must now engage a generation that primarily consumes news through social media platforms like TikTok. Analysts suggest that authenticity will be crucial, as simply adopting youth-oriented slang will not be enough to win over this new, politically aware demographic.</p>

          <p>Shares of Swedish defense company Saab soared over 12% after it reported second-quarter profits and sales that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The company's strong performance is part of a broader trend benefiting European defense stocks, as nations across the continent increase their security budgets. This "era of rearmament" is driven by NATO's push for members to boost defense spending and Europe's own initiatives to strengthen its industrial base. Saab's CEO noted that market activity is extremely high, and the company is ramping up production to meet the surging demand for its defense portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the hype, Flagg remains publicly reserved and intensely focused on improvement, a trait that has defined his rapid ascent through high school and college.

The cancellation means Colbert will not be replaced, and the network will be without a late-night talk show for the first time since 1993.

Abbott, who had previously apologized for the original remarks, stated it is "obvious" the current party leadership wants to force her out.

          <p>The recent action by India's market regulator against high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has put a spotlight on the ambiguous boundary between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation. Arbitrage involves profiting from price discrepancies across different markets, while manipulation involves intentionally distorting prices for an unfair advantage. Experts suggest the key distinction lies in intent; creating a price difference by influencing a less liquid market to profit in a more liquid one can cross the line. SEBI accused Jane Street of just that, alleging the firm manipulated India's Nifty 50 index to benefit its large options positions, a charge the firm disputes. (not investment advice)</p>
