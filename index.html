          <p>The UK government is organizing a chartered flight next week to evacuate British nationals from Israel, following escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, particularly after US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Britons interested in this flight are required to register online but are advised not to go to the airport unless specifically instructed. This initiative follows collaborative efforts between the UK government and Israeli authorities to plan evacuation flights from Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is advising against all travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories due to the ongoing conflict. The current situation is highly volatile and could escalate further. The score reflects a precautionary measure amidst international tensions.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, world leaders and organizations have expressed a range of reactions, from grave alarm and calls for de-escalation to cautious support. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged diplomacy, while allies of Iran, such as Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the strikes and vowed retaliation. Israeli leaders lauded the U.S. action, with Prime Minister Netanyahu praising President Trump's show of strength. The strikes have raised fears of a broader regional conflict and prompted calls for Iran to return to negotiations to resolve the crisis. The world now braces for the fallout of these strikes, with concerns about potential retaliation and further escalation in the Middle East.

The images, released by U.S. defense contractor Maxar Technologies, depict truck and vehicle movements near the entrance of the underground military complex. Fordo, located deep under a mountain and reinforced with concrete, is considered Iran's most hardened nuclear site. The facility, along with nuclear sites at Natanz and Isfahan, was targeted in the U.S. strikes, with President Trump claiming the operation "completely obliterated" Iran's key enrichment facilities.

          <p>The article discusses how Latino voters respond to perceived threats to their community, referencing the current escalation of immigration raids in Los Angeles and the deployment of military forces. While economic issues are typically the primary focus for Latino voters, they tend to coalesce as an ethnic voting bloc when they sense a serious threat. The author argues that Trump's immigration crackdown is likely to decrease his support among Latinos, as such actions activate deeper questions about belonging and acceptance in American society. The piece suggests that Democrats cannot assume Latino support based solely on opposition to harsh immigration policies, and Republicans cannot maintain Latino voters through economic appeals alone.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, and searches are underway for people trapped under rubble in Tel Aviv.
