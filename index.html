          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This call follows allegations from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has asked the Justice Department to investigate Cook for potential mortgage fraud. Pulte accuses Cook of falsifying documents for properties in Michigan and Georgia to secure more favorable loan terms. The incident marks an expansion of Trump's pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, which has previously focused on Chairman Jerome Powell, to influence interest rate policies.</p>

The hearing, which saw significant support for the rapper outside the courthouse, focused on legal arguments about whether the charge was filed within the legal time limit. The chief magistrate will rule on September 26, and Ó hAnnaidh remains free on unconditional bail.</p>

          <p>Chris Brain, a 68-year-old former priest, has been found guilty of 17 counts of indecent assault against nine women who were part of an influential church group he led in Sheffield. The group, known as the Nine O'Clock Service (NOS), was prominent in the 1980s and 90s. Prosecutors detailed how Brain sexually abused women recruited into a "homebase team" tasked with caring for him and his family. The jury acquitted him of 15 other charges and is still deliberating on five remaining counts, including one of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>A UK High Court decision to block a hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers poses a significant challenge to the government's accommodation strategy. The ruling was based on the hotel's breach of local planning controls and the negative impact on the community, including protests and fear of crime. While the decision doesn't set a nationwide ban, it may empower other local councils to launch similar legal challenges if they can demonstrate tangible harm. This complicates the government's efforts to reduce its reliance on hotels for asylum seekers, a system currently housing around 32,000 people.</p>

The policy expands the grounds for rejection and is part of a broader effort to tighten legal immigration. Critics have raised concerns about the subjective nature of what might be defined as "anti-American," potentially giving adjudicators broad discretion to deny applications.</p>

          <p>French police have arrested a man on suspicion of murder following the discovery of four bodies in the River Seine near Choisy-le-Roi, a suburb of Paris. The investigation began after a passer-by spotted the first victim on August 13, leading to the discovery of three other bodies nearby in an advanced state of decomposition. An autopsy revealed that one victim had been strangled and another showed signs of violent injuries. Prosecutors have not yet established a link between the victims and are questioning the suspect.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has proposed a controversial plan to reduce the number of professional rugby clubs in Wales from four to two. The WRU's chief executive described this as a "radical step" necessary to ensure the financial sustainability and competitiveness of the sport in the country. This preferred option is one of four models being considered, with the goal of creating two better-funded elite teams. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the existing regional clubs, and a consultation period will begin before a final decision is made in October.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates this fall will likely be influenced by four primary factors, according to financial experts. The Federal Reserve's future policy decisions and commentary, rather than direct rate changes, will set the market's tone. Key economic data, particularly inflation reports (CPI and PCE) and labor market statistics, will guide the Fed's actions. Additionally, investor activity in mortgage-backed securities and 10-year Treasury bonds will cause daily fluctuations. Finally, broader geopolitical events and economic trends that affect things like oil prices can also significantly impact the direction of rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some farmers in Florida are significantly reducing their crop production due to labor shortages driven by President Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement policies. Farmers report that many migrant workers have left the state out of fear of detention and deportation, while others are in hiding. While the H2A agricultural visa program is an option, farmers say rising costs make it unaffordable to rely on exclusively. The situation is creating economic hardship for the agricultural sector and raising concerns among industry groups about the long-term security of the U.S. food supply.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the transfer of convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell to a minimum-security prison in Texas is an outrageous example of preferential treatment. The author notes that such a move is highly unusual for an inmate convicted of her crimes and suggests it may be the result of a deal struck with the Justice Department. The piece frames the transfer as a "slap in the face" to the victims of Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. It calls for more transparency to combat what one attorney terms a "government-sponsored cover-up" surrounding the full extent of their criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The cost of food continues to rise, with UK inflation data showing a 4.9% increase in the year to July, the highest rate since early 2024. Several factors are contributing to this trend, including adverse climate conditions like drought in the UK and extreme weather abroad, which reduce crop yields and increase wholesale prices. Global events, such as the war in Ukraine, disrupt supply chains for goods and farm inputs. These pressures, combined with rising labor costs, are forcing businesses to pass on the increased expenses to consumers, impacting household budgets.</p>
