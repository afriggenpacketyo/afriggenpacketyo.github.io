        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Middle and major powers are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, using trade, investment, and technology to exert influence, reminiscent of Cold War realpolitik. This approach, while agile and ambiguous, carries risks of entanglements that could escalate instability, requiring leaders to balance relationships between multiple powers without fully committing to any single one. This strategy, exemplified by Henry Kissinger's approach in the 1970s, aims to prevent adversaries from uniting against a nation by fostering closer ties with multiple powers while maintaining strategic ambiguity. The current geopolitical landscape, characterized by declining post-war institutions and rising military budgets, makes triangular diplomacy a prominent approach for leaders. The effectiveness of this approach will depend on careful management of relationships to avoid unintended consequences. The optimism score is calculated with these aforementioned realities.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) deployed a custom-wrapped food truck in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to troll President Trump over his tariff policies. The stunt, intended to mock Trump's tariff policies with the acronym TACO ("Trump Always Chickens Out"), was widely criticized and ridiculed by conservatives on social media. Republican figures and commentators derided the effort as a cheap gimmick and an example of the Democratic Party's struggles with messaging during Trump's presidency. The DNC defended the stunt, stating it was meant to highlight Trump's tendency to back down on his tariff threats.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially reversing long-standing U.S. immigration policy. This proposal, driven by concerns that the asylum system is being exploited, would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a difficult timeframe given current backlogs. Advocates worry that this change would prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, potentially pushing them into the underground economy. The proposed rule would also require asylum-seekers to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit, instead of the current six months. The score is based on the overall impact of the proposed changes on asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>The White House has formally requested Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in funding for NPR, PBS, and international aid, aiming to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cuts. The package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in cuts to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Republicans in Congress have expressed eagerness to act on the rescission process, while Democrats have voiced opposition to the proposed cuts. The optimism score is based on the potential impact of the cuts on public broadcasting and foreign aid programs.</p>

          <p>The White House has revealed a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing the previous image that had drawn comparisons to a mugshot. In the new photograph, Trump stares directly into the camera with a serious expression, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie and an American flag pin.

A White House official stated that the previous portrait was intended as a placeholder, and the new portrait reflects the "optimism and resolve of America."

          <p>President Trump has formally requested Congress to take back the $1.1 billion set aside for public broadcasters, including NPR and PBS, for the next two years. This request follows accusations of partisan bias from Republican allies and sets the stage for a potential elimination of federal funding.

The request is part of a larger package of proposed clawbacks, which include funding for foreign aid. The optimism score is based on the potential impact of the funding cuts.</p>
