          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a one-actor adaptation of Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray* on Broadway, playing all 26 roles with the aid of wigs and elaborate camerawork. The article discusses how the play uses social media tropes to critique the modern obsession with maintaining an idealized aesthetic and the dangers of performing a persona for others, which can erode one's interior life. In contrast, *Vanya*, another play featuring a single actor, suggests that there is richness to be found in seeing oneself as the embodiment of multiple intertwining voices. The adaptation prompts viewers to consider when putting on a performance is a perversion of the truth and when it is a way of becoming more freely oneself.</p>

          <p>Jacob Henriques, an assistant admissions director at Emmanuel College in Boston, has been arrested and charged with attempted sex trafficking of a minor. The article reports that Henriques allegedly used his position to access the personal information of prospective students, contacting them with offers to pay them for sex and sending them pornography. He is accused of contacting a 17-year-old girl within hours of her college tour, offering her $400 for "some fun" and continuing to text her despite her rejections, even after she blocked his number. Emmanuel College has since fired Henriques, and the FBI is seeking to identify other potential victims.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen data-gathering programs that track deaths and disease in the U.S. appear to have been eliminated due to layoffs and proposed budget cuts. According to the article, programs tracking abortions, pregnancies, job-related injuries, lead poisonings, sexual assault, and youth smoking have been terminated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Critics argue that these cuts will hinder the ability to monitor and improve public health, while officials claim the changes aim to eliminate waste and focus on emerging infectious diseases.

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ+ health, impacting research on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affecting this population. The New York Times article details how termination letters cited a lack of alignment with agency priorities and concerns about research based on "gender identity." Scientists are quoted expressing concern that the cuts create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address health disparities. The cuts follow a surge in federal funding for LGBTQ+ research during the Obama administration, but critics argue that the research is riddled with ideological bias.</p>

It argues that science and technology are value-neutral, and it is up to human beings to ensure they are used for good, advocating for scientists to educate the public and participate in public discourse to guide technological development toward beneficial outcomes.</p>

The article cites dwindling supplies of clean water, food, and medicine, with bakeries forced to close and prices of available food soaring.

          <p>Despite warning signs that Donald Trump's tariffs were destabilizing the US economy, Republicans in Congress worked to protect his signature trade policy. The article recounts how a Senate resolution targeting the tariffs was blocked through a White House veto threat and parliamentary tactics in the House. The vote took place against the backdrop of data showing the US economy contracted in the first quarter of the year, which economists attribute to the tariffs. While Democrats criticized the policy, Republicans defended the tariffs as a gamble that would pay off, leading to renegotiated trade policies with numerous countries.</p>

          <h2>One Moment That Foretold It All: Trump's Choice of JD Vance as Vice President</h2>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president was a pivotal moment, signaling a shift from his first term's uneasy coalition to a more loyal and uninhibited "royal court." According to the article, Vance's embrace of MAGA ideology and willingness to challenge the 2020 election results demonstrated Trump's preference for loyalists over moderating influences. The article concludes that this choice reveals Trump's second term would be characterized by ferocity and recklessness, with fewer checks on his power.</p>
