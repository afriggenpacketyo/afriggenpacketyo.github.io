            <h2>ASML Cites Tariff Concerns Amidst Lower-Than-Expected Net Bookings</h2>

            <p>ASML, a key semiconductor equipment manufacturer, reported lower-than-anticipated net bookings for the first quarter of 2025, raising concerns about a potential slowdown in demand for its chipmaking machines. Despite the miss, CEO Christophe Fouquet maintained a strong demand outlook, driven primarily by artificial intelligence. However, he also highlighted the uncertainty created by tariffs, both macroeconomically and in terms of market demand, leading the company to potentially lean towards the lower end of its 2025 revenue guidance of â‚¬30-35 billion. Global chip stocks have been sensitive to tariff-related worries, particularly concerning President Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as the new vice minister of commerce and top representative for international trade negotiation, replacing Wang Shouwen, as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate. The appointment signals a potential shift in China's approach to de-escalate tensions, according to analysts. Li's extensive experience within the Ministry of Commerce and his background with the World Trade Organization are seen as valuable assets in navigating ongoing trade disputes. The White House has indicated that it is open to a trade deal, but expects China to make the first move.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court is set to rule on a legal challenge concerning the definition of a woman, stemming from a dispute between a women's rights group and the Scottish government. The case centers on whether a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate can legally be considered a woman under equality laws, specifically regarding female representation on public boards. For Women Scotland argues that the current definition could allow men with certificates to fulfill female quotas, undermining the intended purpose. The ruling could have UK-wide implications for sex-based rights and single-sex services, raising complex questions about inclusivity and fairness.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong's post office will suspend shipping small parcels to the United States in response to Washington's plan to impose a 120% tariff on low-value parcels from the city. The U.S. government is ending a customs exception that allowed shipments under $800 to enter tax-free. The Hong Kong government criticized the U.S.'s actions as "unreasonable and bullying," stating that it would not collect tariffs on behalf of Washington. This move highlights Hong Kong's difficult position amidst the escalating trade disputes between the U.S. and China, particularly after Washington began treating it as part of mainland China following the implementation of a national security law.</p>

            <p>In Oakland's special mayoral election, Loren Taylor took a slim early lead against Barbara Lee, a former Democratic representative, triggering a ranked-choice election count that may take days to finalize. The election was prompted by the recall of Mayor Sheng Thao due to frustrations over crime, homelessness, and financial mismanagement. Taylor, a former city councilmember, appealed to voters seeking a change from career politicians, while Lee, a progressive icon, campaigned on her experience and ability to unite diverse interests. The outcome of the election will determine the city's direction in addressing its pressing challenges.</p>

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as its new international trade representative at the Ministry of Commerce amid escalating trade tensions with the United States.

            <p>A proposed Texas bill, Senate Bill 6, could potentially hinder President Trump's ambitious AI initiative, "Stargate," by adding regulatory hurdles and increasing costs for data center construction. The bill aims to safeguard against power outages but could delay or derail the project, pushing businesses to other states. Critics warn that this could put Texas behind in the global AI race, especially as China advances in the field.
