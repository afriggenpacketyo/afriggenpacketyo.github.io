          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to use its influence to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital trade route for crude oil. Rubio highlighted China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports and suggested it would be "economic suicide" for Iran to block the waterway, as Iran's own oil exports also pass through it. The U.S. Fifth Fleet, stationed in Bahrain, is responsible for protecting maritime trade in the Persian Gulf, and it is generally believed that the U.S. Navy would respond swiftly to any attempt by Iran to block the strait, though some analysts caution against underestimating the potential for disruption. The situation remains tense, with the potential for significant global economic consequences. Optimism is tempered by the potential for escalation and the complex geopolitical dynamics involved.</p>

          <p>Former WNBA star Angel McCoughtry has criticized Chicago Sky rookie Hailey Van Lith, suggesting her popularity on social media played a role in her draft selection. McCoughtry questioned whether Van Lith would be in the league if she had fewer followers, implying that other players with better talent may be overlooked due to their lack of social media presence. Van Lith, a solid guard who played for Louisville and LSU before transferring to TCU, has a significant social media following. McCoughtry later apologized for singling out Van Lith, acknowledging that she worked hard for everything she achieved.</p>

About 150 people, including children, were attending the service, and the church had a security team in place due to previous violence at other places of worship.

          <p>An opinion piece in the LA Times discusses the increasing trend of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks, arguing that this practice undermines their authority and endangers public safety. The author notes several incidents where masked agents have detained individuals, leading to confusion and potential violations of civil rights. While there is no specific federal policy prohibiting masks, the author argues that it contradicts Department of Homeland Security regulations requiring agents to identify themselves. The piece also highlights the risk of individuals impersonating ICE agents and calls for Congress to ban the use of masks by immigration agents.</p>

He expressed concern that the strikes were undertaken without the approval of Congress, which he said holds the sole authority to declare war.

          <p>A gunman opened fire during a service at Crosspointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, wounding at least one person before being killed by a security guard. The church's pastor reported that a church member ran the shooter over with his truck, allowing the security guard time to intervene. The person shot in the leg was the security guard.

          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System has issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following the U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no current specific threats, the bulletin warns of potential low-level cyber attacks and possible attacks by violent extremists. U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots since 2020, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate attacks on targets. The bulletin advises the public on how to stay safe during the heightened threat environment.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces diplomatic challenges following the US airstrikes on Iran, as his calls for de-escalation have not been heeded by the White House. The UK has avoided direct military involvement but supports the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons program. Starmer's position has shifted since earlier in the week, when he seemed confident that Trump would not intervene. The US may request military support from the UK in the coming weeks, prompting further difficult decisions for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships has identified five toxic phrases that make children refuse to listen. The phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, parents should use language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, such as "I know you don't like this decision. I'll explain, and then we're moving forward" and "I see you're really upset. Tell me what's happening." This approach creates conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>

Around 20% of the world's oil and gas flow through the narrow channel, and its closure would likely mean rising fuel costs for global consumers. While the parliament has agreed to endorse blocking the strait, the decision ultimately belongs to Iran's Supreme National Security Council.

          <p>The U.S. precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, code-named "Operation Midnight Hammer," was the largest strike using B2 bombers in history and the longest flight involving the fleet since 2001.

More than 125 aircraft participated in the mission, and U.S. officials said the Iranian military was caught completely by surprise.
