          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to consider a face-to-face meeting in June, coinciding with the Group of Seven summit in Canada, to discuss trade tariffs. Both leaders expressed optimism for productive ministerial-level tariff negotiations beforehand, aiming for mutually beneficial bilateral relations. Japan is particularly concerned about the U.S.'s 25 percent import duty on cars and other tariffs impacting its export-driven economy. The leaders also discussed broader bilateral cooperation, including economic security, with Trump sharing insights from his recent diplomatic trip to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

          <p>BYD, a Chinese carmaker, has outsold Tesla in Europe for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in April, marking a significant shift in the European car market. BYD's BEV sales surged by 169% year-on-year to 7,231 units, while Tesla's sales fell by 49% to 7,165 units during the same period. This milestone comes despite the European Union's imposition of hefty tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. The overall demand for BEVs in Europe continues to rise, accounting for 17% of new car registrations in April, with Chinese firms driving much of this growth.</p>

          <p>Gaby Hinsliff discusses the increasing use of the term "DEI hire" as a derogatory label, particularly in online spaces, and its implications for equality and inclusion. The article highlights how this taunt, fueled by Donald Trump's rhetoric against "woke" policies, undermines the achievements of individuals from non-traditional backgrounds. It also touches on the concept of "impostor syndrome," where successful women and minorities fear being exposed as frauds, exacerbated by constant online harassment. The author argues that Britain must actively resist the spread of such prejudices to maintain a fair and inclusive society.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times opinion article, Lydia Polgreen discusses President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, noting the initial similarities between the two leaders as wealthy businessmen turned politicians. However, the meeting was largely unproductive, with Trump focusing on unsubstantiated claims of white South Africans facing genocide rather than addressing pressing issues like tariffs and aid. Ramaphosa, known for his negotiation skills in ending apartheid, was seemingly ambushed by Trump's focus on a racist narrative. The article suggests Trump's actions serve to rally his base rather than foster meaningful diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>The Maya Ixil community in Guatemala is mobilizing against transnational corporations that have invaded their land to install hydroelectric plants without proper consultation. ConcepciÃ³n Santay GÃ³mez, a member of the community, recounts the historical invasions they have faced, including the Spanish conquest, land dispossession, and the genocide in 1982. The current struggle is to protect their rivers and mountains from exploitation, appealing to the International Labour Organization's Convention 169, which guarantees indigenous peoples' right to decide their development priorities. Despite a court ruling in 2015 mandating consultation with indigenous communities, the hydroelectric project continues to operate, leading to increased migration and environmental damage.</p>

Trump promised to support the crypto industry, criticizing the previous administration's enforcement actions.
