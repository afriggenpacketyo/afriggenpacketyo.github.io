          <p>The appearance of a senior Taiwanese officer at a US military exercise in Alaska has sparked interest in Taiwan, suggesting potentially closer defense cooperation with the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force's flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, which involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the US, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. Analysts suggest the move indicates the US commitment to its security partners in the region despite previous concerns about transactional approaches. This event underscores the ongoing strategic importance of Taiwan in US foreign policy and defense strategy.</p>

          <p>A tornado in North Dakota resulted in the deaths of at least three people and caused significant damage to residences and livestock in rural Enderlin. Cass County Sheriff Jesse Jahner noted that the nighttime timing of the storm may have limited residents' ability to prepare adequately. The Enderlin Sheldon Fire Department reported around ten homes damaged and livestock losses, describing the event as the worst they have encountered. Another round of severe storms is anticipated, with potential for hail, wind, and further tornado activity; nearby Minnesota also experienced severe storm damage, leaving thousands without power.</p>

          <p>An Irvine animal trainer and his girlfriend were arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty and destruction of evidence after at least ten dogs died in their care, with nine deaths occurring around the same day. The investigation began when a pet owner reported their dog's sudden death and cremation, leading to the discovery of other similar cases. Police are working with veterinary professionals to conduct necropsies to determine the causes of death, and they believe the couple attempted to destroy evidence by cremating the dogs. The trainer, Kwong “Tony” Chun Sit, operated under various company names, including “Happy K9 Academy.”</p>

While some Democrats express concern over the fundraising gap and the party's direction, the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, raising roughly $40 million in individual donations since February.

          <p>The Israel-Iran war has entered its second week with continued strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, as Iran warns against U.S. intervention. Israeli airstrikes hit a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, while Iran launched drones and missiles at Israel, resulting in casualties on both sides. President Trump is considering potential U.S. military intervention, as B-2 stealth bombers are being moved to Guam. The ongoing conflict has resulted in numerous casualties and heightened tensions in the region, with fears of a wider regional conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year with temperatures surpassing 33C, triggering a Met Office warning for thunderstorms. An amber heat-health alert remains in effect, with predictions of nearly 600 heat-related deaths in England and Wales over the next four days. Passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault caused by the extreme heat, while regions across the UK met heatwave criteria. The National Fire Chiefs Council urged caution with barbecues and flammable materials, and scientists noted that climate change is increasing the likelihood of hotter and longer heatwaves.</p>
