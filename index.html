          <h2>Samsung Electronics Secures $16.5 Billion Chip Supply Contract Through 2033</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 23:05:13 EDT</div>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a massive $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, with the deal running until the end of 2033. The South Korean tech giant did not disclose the name of the counterparty, citing a request to protect trade secrets, which has led to speculation about the client's identity. While local media suggests Qualcomm, some analysts believe Tesla is a more likely customer for chips potentially manufactured using Samsung's next-generation 2-nanometer technology. This significant long-term agreement provides a major boost to Samsung's foundry business as it competes with industry leader TSMC.</p>

          <p>In a heartfelt tribute, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler remembered his final performance with Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away at 76 after battling health issues. Butler described being shocked by how frail his longtime friend had become, noting Osbourne performed the show while seated on a throne. The essay details the emotional final concert, which served as a massive homage to the "Prince of Darkness," and Butler's regret at not having more time with him backstage. He reflects on their 57-year friendship, calling Osbourne a "born entertainer" and expressing gratitude for their last show together.</p>

          <h2>UK Nurses' Union Poised to Reject Pay Offer, Raising Prospect of Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 21:59:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay award in a consultative vote. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque," highlighting that it is lower than increases given to other public sector workers like doctors and teachers. With a high turnout anticipated, this rejection sets the stage for a potential formal strike ballot in the autumn if the government does not enter into further negotiations. The GMB union, representing other health workers, has also rejected the deal, increasing pressure on the Health Secretary.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association and other leading medical organizations are expressing deep concern over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This independent panel of primary care experts has provided trusted, evidence-based guidelines on disease prevention since 1984, influencing everything from cancer screenings to managing chronic conditions. The potential move follows Kennedy's recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, raising fears of political interference that could erode trust in established medical guidance and disrupt patient care across the country.</p>

          <p>A new trade analysis using the OEC Tariff Simulator projects a significant reconfiguration of U.S. trade flows following the new deal with the European Union. The model forecasts that global exports to the U.S. could drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to recent averages, while U.S. exports are expected to rise. The 15% tariff framework is predicted to cause the U.S. to import significantly less from China, Canada, and Mexico, while increasing imports from the UK, France, and Spain. Experts warn that this rewiring of trade relationships will make many products more expensive for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The far-right Sanseito party has seen a dramatic surge in Japanese politics, growing from one to fifteen seats and challenging the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). This article explores the roots of this shift, linking it to widespread economic frustration over inflation, stagnant wages, and rising prices for staples like rice. The party's "Japan First" slogan, echoing Donald Trump's rhetoric, resonates with voters who are also angered by issues like misbehaving tourists and rising immigration. Analysts suggest this populist movement capitalizes on a blend of economic anxiety and nationalist sentiment, marking a significant upheaval in Japan's traditionally stable political landscape.</p>

The deal, finalized after a meeting between Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods, half the rate previously threatened by the U.S. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S., including major purchases of American energy and military equipment. The deal brings a measure of stability and predictability to the world's largest trading partnership.</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid growing concerns over imported pets. An investigation found that thousands of dogs are being brought into the country from places like Romania and Ukraine and sold with minimal vetting, a process likened to a "Deliveroo for dogs." Owners have reported serious issues, including aggressive behavior and infectious diseases like Brucella canis, which can pass to humans. Experts warn these dogs are like "ticking time bombs," posing a risk not only to their new owners but also to the UK's native dog population.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow aid agencies to address the territory's deepening hunger crisis. The pause in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi is intended to create secure land routes for the United Nations and other groups to distribute humanitarian supplies. This move comes after months of warnings from food experts about the risk of famine and growing international criticism over the humanitarian situation. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need.</p>

The system severely underestimated the quake's magnitude, sending its highest-level "Take Action" warning to only 469 phones, when ten million people were in the area of strongest shaking. Most users received a lower-level "Be Aware" alert not designed to wake people up, a critical failure as the first quake struck early in the morning.

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his witty and incisive songs in the 1950s and '60s, has died at the age of 97. Lehrer rose to fame with his sharp, piano-driven commentary on topics ranging from politics and nuclear war to the Catholic Church, becoming an underground sensation before contributing to the NBC show "That Was The Week That Was." Despite his influence on generations of comedians, he retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his other career as a mathematics teacher. He was remembered as a comedic hero for his unique genre of smart, subversive songwriting.</p>

          <p>The ancient village of Keeladi in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has become the center of a historical and political battle following major archaeological discoveries. Excavations have unearthed a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts dating back to 580 BCE, challenging established narratives about early civilization in the subcontinent. State archaeologists claim the findings, including an ancient form of the Tamil Brahmi script, suggest a literate, urban society in the south that is older than previously thought, sparking a debate that intersects with India's deep-rooted north-south cultural and political divide. The site has become a symbol of Tamil pride.</p>

In 1978, Patricia Roisinblit was taken to a death camp while pregnant; her baby boy was stolen after birth and given to a military family. The story follows her mother Rosa and daughter Mariana, who spent over two decades searching for him, eventually finding him working in a fast-food restaurant. It explores the complex and painful aftermath of the reunion, the rebuilding of his identity, and the difficult truth that some things, once broken, can never be fully mended.</p>

          <p>An extraordinary investigation led by an Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist successfully located and recovered a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." During the 1970s, political prisoners were drugged and thrown from this plane into the Atlantic Ocean. The investigators tracked the plane to the United States, where it was being used for skydiving, and obtained its flight logs. These logs provided irrefutable proof of the clandestine flights, becoming key evidence in a historic trial that convicted the pilots. The plane has now been returned to Argentina as a chilling witness to history.</p>

The ship spilled billions of plastic pellets, known as nurdles, which now appear to be accumulating more pollution from the ocean, acting like chemical sponges. New research found that nurdles from the wreck leach toxic metals, and tests on local fish revealed levels of hazardous metals exceeding safe limits. The disaster has devastated the local fishing community and has led to a legal battle over compensation for the long-term environmental damage.</p>
