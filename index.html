CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, and CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will become CEO of the global networks business.

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA is considering claiming that planet-heating pollution from US power plants is insignificant enough to avoid climate regulation. However, analysis reveals that emissions from American fossil-fuel plants account for 5% of global planet-heating pollution since 1990. This would make the US power sector the sixth-largest emitter globally. The EPA's plan to eliminate restrictions on greenhouse gases contradicts the sector's significant impact on climate change and public health.</p>

          <p>Chicago is better positioned than most cities to resist President Trump's mass deportation agenda due to its long history of protecting immigrant communities. The city has implemented strategies, including community meetings, rapid-response groups, and volunteer efforts, to resist ICE activity. Despite these efforts, Chicago immigrant advocacy groups face challenges, including attempts to change the city's sanctuary status. The city's commitment to protecting immigrants is evident through its policies and resistance to conservative attempts to roll back progress.</p>
