        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, which stems from a lawsuit brought by small businesses importing goods. The court's decision has been welcomed by global markets, with Asian stock markets and US stock futures rising following the announcement. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration plans to revoke visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields," a move likely to increase tensions between the US and China. The State Department is also revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. The phrase "critical fields" likely refers to research in the physical sciences, as American officials have expressed concerns about the Chinese government recruiting US-trained scientists. This decision has raised anxiety across university campuses, as many institutions rely on international students for research and tuition revenue.</p>

At a press conference in Tokyo, the 41-year-old Hokkaido native stated her intention to go all out to win in her final season.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, Beijing should be prepared for Washington to adopt alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, as the Trump administration has recognized the limitations of imposing heavy tariffs. While President Trump might continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results. Wu suggests that such measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security, indicating a shift towards a broader strategy in dealing with China. This reflects a growing understanding of the complexities of US-China relations.</p>

          <p>Nearly 10 months after a Texas family's boat capsized off the coast of Homer, Alaska, human remains have been found at the bottom of the bay. David and Mary Maynard, along with their two sons, went missing in August 2024. Private companies assisted Alaska State Troopers in locating the missing boat, and divers recovered three sets of remains from the sunken vessel. The remains have been transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for identification, providing some closure to the family.</p>

          <p>The Guardian explores the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind their radicalization and involvement in what the author describes as apartheid. The article draws parallels to revanchist Frenchmen and highlights the elaborate social apparatus through which young Americans are radicalized, including Zionist summer camps. It contrasts this with the scrutiny faced by Muslims and discusses the establishment's affinity for Israel. The author hopes that awareness of the atrocities committed by Israeli troops will deter American parents from allowing their children to participate.</p>

However, he also stated that tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different logic and standards, making it inappropriate to mix them. Japan has requested the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum, but the Trump administration has resisted complete removal.

          <p>The Bank of Korea cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, marking its fourth cut in the last six meetings, due to political turmoil and Trump's sweeping tariffs. The decision came as South Korea grapples with political uncertainty and the potential impact of 25% reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The central bank also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%. The country's Kospi stock index jumped following the announcement, while the South Korean won weakened.
