        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its key policy rate steady at 2.5%, a level that marks a nearly three-year low for the country. This decision comes as South Korea's economy faces significant challenges, including a quarterly contraction of 0.2% due to weak construction and slowing exports. Despite these economic pressures, the central bank is also contending with concerns about financial stability, driven by a recent surge in housing prices and household debt. The economic outlook is further complicated by potential U.S. tariffs, which could impose additional headwinds on the nation's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Considers Easing Environmental Laws to Expedite Clean Energy Projects</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 21:09:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a potential federal megabill that could eliminate clean energy subsidies, California lawmakers are considering rolling back environmental regulations to accelerate project construction. Proponents, including State Senator Scott Wiener, argue that exempting clean energy projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is necessary to meet tight federal deadlines for subsidies. This proposal faces opposition from environmental groups, who are wary of undermining protections, citing recent controversial exemptions for manufacturing plants. The debate highlights the difficult balance California faces between maintaining its environmental standards and advancing its clean energy goals amid shifting federal policies.</p>

          <h2>US Threatens Brazil with 50% Tariff, Citing Political and Trade Grievances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 21:07:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two nations. In a letter, President Trump cited Brazil's alleged "attacks" on U.S. tech companies and what he termed a "witch hunt" against former President Jair Bolsonaro as justifications. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva responded by stating that any unilateral tariff increase would be met with reciprocal measures, warning against interference in Brazil's judicial system. This targeted action marks a departure from broader trade negotiations and links economic policy directly to the internal political affairs of another sovereign nation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has confirmed that a 50% tariff on all copper imports into the United States will take effect on August 1, 2025. The administration justified the steep tariff by citing a national security assessment, emphasizing copper's critical role in defense manufacturing, including its use in semiconductors, aircraft, and advanced weapons systems. This move aligns copper with the 50% duties already placed on steel and aluminum, reflecting a broader strategy to protect and reshore key industrial production. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, making this a significant shift in trade policy for the essential metal.</p>

The piece specifically names American defense contractor Lockheed Martin as a provider of destructive weaponry used in the conflict.

This move follows a critical Department of Homeland Security review that identified significant law enforcement breakdowns and complacency within the agency.

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has not fully rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining nearly a year lower in 2024 than in 2019. While the virus was the primary driver of the decline during the pandemic's peak, the persistent gap is now largely attributed to drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The recovery has been notably slower for Black and Hispanic residents, exacerbating pre-existing racial and income-based disparities in health outcomes. The research underscores how the pandemic's ripple effects, combined with ongoing public health crises, continue to shape mortality trends and highlight deep-seated structural inequities in the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's animal welfare laws for egg-laying hens are driving up consumer prices and should be superseded by federal regulations. The suit targets multiple state propositions that mandate specific space requirements for farm animals, claiming these rules constitute "unnecessary red tape" that depresses egg production. The Justice Department contends that these state-level mandates, which apply to all eggs sold in California, are preempted by the federal Egg Products Inspection Act. This legal challenge represents another front in the ongoing political and legal conflicts between the federal administration and the state of California.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its largest single-day drone attack on Ukraine since the war began, firing over 700 drones and 13 missiles in an overnight barrage.

The massive assault occurred just after President Trump pledged more weapons for Ukraine and issued sharp criticism of Vladimir Putin, calling his words "meaningless." The Kremlin responded to the remarks with a statement that it was "quite calm," highlighting the complex diplomatic backdrop to the intensifying conflict.</p>
