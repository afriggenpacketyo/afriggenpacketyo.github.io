          <p>Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi made a surprise return to the Glastonbury festival, performing on the Pyramid Stage two years after taking a break to focus on his mental health and Tourette's syndrome. He told the supportive crowd he wanted to finish the set he was unable to complete in 2023, where his voice failed and fans helped him sing. The performance coincided with the release of his new single, "Survive," which addresses his personal struggles. His return was met with widespread enthusiasm from fans and fellow artists.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld a Texas law that mandates pornography websites verify the age of their visitors. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the state has the authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content and that age verification is a permissible exercise of that power. The ruling found that the law does not unconstitutionally burden adults' First Amendment rights. The dissent, authored by Justice Elena Kagan, contended that the law impedes adults' access to protected speech and should be subject to a more stringent legal review.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New Orleans has ordered a Catholic religious order to pay nearly $2.4 million in damages to a man who was sexually abused as a child by one of its members in the 1960s. This landmark verdict is the first of its kind since a 2024 Louisiana law allowed survivors to file civil suits regardless of when the abuse occurred. The plaintiff, John Lousteau, detailed a life of struggle with addiction and PTSD following the abuse he suffered at a summer camp run by the Holy Cross order. The significant award could influence how the New Orleans archdiocese handles hundreds of other abuse claims in its ongoing bankruptcy case.</p>

          <p>Americans are increasingly prioritizing saving over spending, a trend dubbed "revenge saving," as concerns about inflation, tariffs, and job security grow. The U.S. personal saving rate has risen significantly in 2025, reflecting a shift away from the post-pandemic "revenge spending" splurge. This cautious financial behavior is also seen in record-high 401(k) contribution rates, as workers focus on long-term security. Financial experts suggest this defensive strategy helps consumers build a cash cushion to shield themselves from future economic volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has defended his government's welfare reform plans after making significant concessions to avert a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The initial proposals would have tightened eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), but the stricter criteria will now only apply to new claimants. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients. While the compromise has satisfied many MPs, some on the left of the party still plan to vote against the bill, arguing the changes do not go far enough.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the nature of rules and the folly of expecting them to be followed, drawing a parallel between a pedestrian ignoring a crosswalk signal and the precarious state of international diplomacy. The author argues that the recent US-Iran brinkmanship demonstrates the danger of abandoning established agreements, like the Iran nuclear deal, in favor of an honor system. The piece suggests a cynical but practical worldview: assume others will flout the rules and prepare for the worst. This approach, the author contends, is necessary in an era of wobbly institutions and low trust.</p>

The damages sought are notably similar to the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, with Newsom stating he will fight the network's "propaganda machine."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved $30 million in funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private food distribution group that a UN agency has labeled a "death trap." The organization's operations have been marred by reports of hundreds of civilians being killed and wounded while trying to access its aid hubs. While the GHF disputes the figures, other humanitarian organizations like Doctors Without Borders have refused to cooperate, calling the group an "Israeli-U.S. proxy." The State Department defended the funding, urging other nations to support the GHF and stating Hamas bears responsibility for the conflict.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the USNS Harvey Milk, a naval ship named for the assassinated gay rights leader, will be renamed the USNS Oscar V. Peterson. The new name honors a Navy chief watertender who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism during World War II. Hegseth stated the change was part of an effort to take politics out of ship naming, contrasting it with the previous administration's decision. The move comes during Pride Month and has drawn attention as part of a broader review of ships named after civil rights figures.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies, a practice that has frequently thwarted both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 ruling came in a case related to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that such universal orders likely exceed the authority Congress granted to federal courts. The decision narrows the scope of injunctions but does not completely eliminate them, stating they should not be broader than necessary to provide relief to the plaintiffs involved in a case.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of Maryland parents who sought to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving storybooks with LGBTQ+ themes. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, stated that denying opt-outs for instruction that conflicts with families' religious beliefs places an unconstitutional burden on their religious freedom. The court ordered the school district to provide advance notice and allow children to be excused while the lawsuit proceeds. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned the decision could create chaos for public schools and impose impossible administrative burdens.</p>

It weighed over a ton and detonated with the energy equivalent of 20 tons of TNT, creating a pressure wave that resulted in audible booms on the ground.

The map, which was redrawn by the GOP-led legislature to create a second majority-Black district, had been challenged as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court's decision to order more arguments means the current map, which was used in the 2024 elections and resulted in the election of two Black Democrats, will remain in place for now.

          <p>The Supreme Court's ruling limiting nationwide injunctions, while an immediate benefit to the Trump administration, is not a complete ban on the practice. The decision in the birthright citizenship case suggests that while such broad orders should be rare, they may still be permissible when necessary to provide "complete relief" to a plaintiff, such as a state. The opinion leaves the door open for a nationwide injunction in this specific case and suggests class-action lawsuits as another path to similar relief. This nuanced decision could also benefit future Democratic administrations by reining in the power of single district judges.</p>
