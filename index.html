          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby voiced optimism regarding the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) overhaul, highlighting bipartisan commitment and funding for the project. Kirby acknowledged recent air traffic control outages and delays, particularly at Newark Liberty International Airport, but emphasized that safety remains the aviation industry's top priority. He outlined backup procedures, including alternative frequencies and radar systems, to ensure safe skies during outages. Kirby mentioned United has proactively reduced flights to alleviate airport congestion, and stressed that slowing down the system is a deliberate safety measure that can disrupt customers.</p>

          <p>London Stansted Airport experienced significant delays due to an IT issue that affected check-in, baggage handling, and security systems, leading to long queues extending outside the terminal building. Passengers faced hours-long waits, with some missing their flights as a result of the disruption. While the IT issue has been resolved, departing flights may still experience delays, and the airport has apologized to passengers, advising them to stay in contact with their airlines. Engineers are working to fully restore all systems as quickly as possible to mitigate further disruptions.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States held a fourth round of talks in Muscat, Oman, regarding Iran's nuclear program, aiming to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear activities through diplomacy.

The talks are mediated by Omani officials, with Steve Witkoff representing the U.S. and Abbas Araghchi representing Iran. The negotiations occur as President Trump prepares to travel to the Middle East and has threatened military action if the talks fail.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests the creation of "Father's Day Month" to follow Mother's Day, proposing a 35-day celebration with alternating days of presents and complete family silence for dads. He acknowledges the absurdity of the idea while playfully advocating for greater recognition of fathers. Gaffigan envisions "Father's Day Month" as an "off-and-on holiday" with specific rules and conditions. The commentary is a lighthearted take on the appreciation of fathers, with Gaffigan noting that he truly cherishes Mother's Day as it ushers in the time to celebrate dads.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing wildfires across Scotland, Wales, and England due to an unusually dry spring, with officials warning of a potential drought this summer.

The Met Office reports that April received only 56% of its average rainfall, while March saw just 43%. While no water bans are in place in Britain, the Environment Agency has warned of a medium risk of drought this summer if there is not consistent rainfall.</p>

          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and banned for two racing days for using his whip excessively during the race. The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) found that Alvarado struck the horse eight times, exceeding the permitted six strikes. This marks his second offense within 180 days, resulting in a doubled fine representing 20% of his Kentucky Derby winnings. Sovereignty will not compete in the upcoming Preakness Stakes.</p>

          <p>Despite the hype around artificial intelligence (AI), it is not yet capable of replacing human workers in most jobs, and the day when it will be is still a long way off. Many businesses that laid off employees in anticipation of AI taking over their roles are now regretting the decision. While AI platforms can enhance search capabilities, they are not reliable enough to handle core business operations without human oversight. The cost of building and maintaining AI systems is also prohibitively expensive for most small and mid-sized companies.</p>
