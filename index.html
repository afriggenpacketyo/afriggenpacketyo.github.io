        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline of over 34% in May, marking the steepest drop in more than five years, attributed to the effects of tariffs and trade tensions. Despite this significant decrease in U.S.-bound shipments, China's overall exports rose by 4.8% due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. Imports also plunged by 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, while the country's total trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion. Renewed trade talks are expected to take place in London between Chinese and U.S. officials to address ongoing disputes and potential violations of the Geneva trade agreement. </p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles saw clashes between anti-ICE protesters and law enforcement, resulting in fires and the deployment of the National Guard, ordered by President Trump. The protests were triggered by immigration enforcement operations, leading to multiple arrests and injuries to federal law enforcement officers. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and requested its rescission, while LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the department's compliance with the California Values Act, which restricts assistance to federal immigration enforcement. Demonstrators blocked freeways, vandalized vehicles, and clashed with authorities, prompting a tactical alert for the entire city, with the situation escalating after multiple federal search warrants were served across Los Angeles. </p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures as stimulus measures struggle to boost domestic consumption. The consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.1% year-on-year, driven by weak consumer demand and price wars in the automotive sector, which have hurt businesses' profitability. Factory-gate prices also deepened, falling by 3.3%, marking the steepest decline since July 2023, while core inflation rose slightly to 0.6%. Chinese policymakers are being urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures to stimulate consumption, and markets are watching for potential monetary easing policies from Beijing.

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning a trip to the United States this week for a sixth round of ministerial-level talks aimed at securing concessions on tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump. Ryosei Akazawa, the minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy, will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to discuss the additional tariffs' serious impact on Japan's export-oriented economy. The Japanese government is urging the Trump administration to remove these tariffs, particularly as a national election approaches this summer. While discussions are progressing, the two sides have yet to find common ground, but intensive deliberations on trade expansion and economic security cooperation are expected to continue. </p>

          <p>India's ambitious $80 billion investment in coal-fired power plants is increasingly threatened by water scarcity, as many new projects are located in water-stressed areas. This poses a significant challenge to the country's energy plans, as power plants require substantial water resources for cooling and operation. The prioritization of land access over water availability has led to potential conflicts between industry and local communities. While India is investing in renewable energy, coal-fired power remains a dominant source, raising concerns about sustainable water management and long-term energy security. </p>

          <p>China's trade data for May revealed a slowdown in export growth and a decline in imports, indicating continued strain in the country's manufacturing and trade sectors. Export growth slowed to 4.8%, falling short of expectations, while exports to the United States plunged by 34.52% due to ongoing trade tensions. Imports also fell by 3.4%, reflecting weaker domestic demand, while China's trade surplus stood at $103.2 billion. These figures highlight the challenges facing China's economy amid lingering uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and global trade dynamics. </p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it an overreach of power and based on false pretenses. The editorial argues that local law enforcement had the protests under control, and the governor did not request or need the Guard's presence. The board notes that this is an unusual move, as the National Guard is typically brought in during emergencies at the request of state leaders. The editorial board argues that Trump is using the deployment to create chaos and incite division. </p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters to protect marine life and the seabed. The proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 in the UK's offshore areas already designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This announcement comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by bottom trawling. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, seeking views from the marine and fishing industry. </p>

          <p>The Posse Comitatus Act is at the heart of the disagreement between President Trump and California Governor Newsom regarding the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. The act generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist, including congressional decree or the inability of state governments to maintain order. Trump deployed the National Guard in response to attacks on ICE agents, while Newsom argues the deployment is unlawful and inflames tensions. The potential for the military to take an active role in suppressing riots hinges on interpretations of the act and its exceptions. </p>
