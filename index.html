            <p>Chinese cities are facing new economic realities as population declines accelerate, impacting businesses and local governments. Marketing trainers like Chen Xiaokai are closely monitoring demographic shifts to adjust sales strategies for industries like wedding photography. Cities that attract migrants, such as Chengdu, are experiencing stable business, while others, particularly in the northeast, are struggling with shrinking populations and workforce. The population crisis has far-reaching implications, including abandoned buildings, reduced consumer spending, and decreased fiscal revenues for local governments, posing significant challenges for urban development and economic growth.</p>

The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking reduced sentences and potential parole eligibility. The DA's office argued that the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes, while the defense contends they have rehabilitated themselves in prison.

            <p>President Trump reported that he took a cognitive test as part of his latest physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Trump told reporters that he got every answer right on the cognitive test and that his doctors would provide a report on his results. This follows a similar cognitive test he took during his first White House physical in 2018, which he also claimed to have aced. Presidents are not obligated to reveal their medical records, but Trump's health has been a topic of discussion due to his age.</p>

            <p>Southern California Edison (Edison) has identified the possibility of an idle, unconnected transmission line somehow re-energizing as a leading theory for the cause of the Eaton fire. Edison will implement measures to harden other idle towers and lines to prevent similar incidents. The theory suggests the idle line may have been re-energized through induction, sparking the fire. Edison is revising its internal manual to ensure proper grounding of idle equipment and is conducting field inspections of idle equipment.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles court has ruled that the resentencing hearing for the Menendez brothers can move forward, despite opposition from the district attorney. The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking a lesser term, potentially making them eligible for freedom. The ruling means that high-profile hearings will continue to decide whether the convicted killers will be resentenced. The brothers' effort is based on a California law allowing inmates under 26 at the time of their crimes to seek resentencing.</p>

The state resumed executions after a 13-year pause due to difficulties in obtaining lethal injection drugs. Mahdi's execution is the 12th in the U.S. this year, as states explore alternative methods due to drug shortages.</p>

The government conceded Mr Garcia was deported due to an 'administrative error', but alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies.</p>
