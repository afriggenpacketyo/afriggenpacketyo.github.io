          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who participated in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon she received from him. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and whitewash the events of that day. She is working with her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon, contrasting with other Jan. 6 defendants who have embraced their pardons. Hemphill argues that accepting the pardon would be an admission of guilt and a betrayal of her principles, setting her apart from others involved in the riot. </p>

Beyond the potential physical damage, the attack sends a message to both Russia and Ukraine's Western allies about Kyiv's continued resolve and capabilities.

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack deep into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers, as ceasefire talks are set to resume in Istanbul. Ukrainian security sources claim the attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia, with officials not stating the cause of the blasts. Zelenskyy announced that he is sending a delegation to Istanbul for face-to-face talks with Russian representatives. </p>

          <p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) removed a list of “sanctuary” states, cities, and counties from its website after criticism from a sheriffs’ association. The association argued that a list of “noncompliant” sheriffs could damage the relationship between the Trump administration and law enforcement. DHS had published the list, deeming those areas as having policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Leaders of some cities publicly questioned the sanctuary label, asserting that they had never adopted such policies. </p>
