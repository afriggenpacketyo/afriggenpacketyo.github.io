          <h2>Cardiologist Explains How Extreme Summer Heat Increases Cardiac Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 05:00:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist from Miami warns that extreme summer heat forces the heart to work significantly harder to cool the body down. This increased strain can lead to dehydration and thicken the blood, elevating the risk of heart attacks, heart failure, and irregular rhythms, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. The article highlights warning signs like chest tightness, shortness of breath, and dizziness, advising people to stay hydrated and avoid strenuous activity during peak heat. It also notes that certain heart medications can amplify the body's adverse reaction to high temperatures.</p>

          <p>A vast complex of ancient tombs from China's Western Xia dynasty has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Located near the city of Yinchuan, the 40-square-kilometer site includes nine imperial mausoleums and over 270 subordinate tombs dating back to a period between 1038 and 1227. The World Heritage Committee recognized the site as a significant testament to the cultural fusion and interaction between diverse traditions along the historic Silk Road. The complex also features extensive flood control structures and a large architectural site used for worship and management.</p>

          <p>Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by majority decision, concluding their historic boxing trilogy with a definitive 3-0 record at Madison Square Garden. Taylor described the fight as a smart, tactical performance where she successfully executed her game plan of constant movement, making it a much clearer victory than their previous encounters. The event, which topped an all-female card, was hailed by Taylor as a proud moment for women's sports. While she savored the win, the 39-year-old fighter remained non-committal about her future, including a potential third match against Chantelle Cameron.</p>

          <p>During a visit to flood-stricken Texas, President Trump praised the swift disaster response from state and local officials while meeting with first responders and victims' families. The visit occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty regarding the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which Trump has previously suggested overhauling to place more responsibility on states. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem emphasized the federal government's supporting role, aligning with the administration's goal of empowering local control. Trump dismissed questions about the adequacy of flood warning systems, calling the query "evil" and focusing on the heroism of the response.</p>

          <p>In response to increasing flood events across the U.S., this guide outlines how residents can research the flood risk to their homes. It emphasizes that past flooding is a key indicator of future risk, which is exacerbated by climate change, and notes that many states lack mandatory flood disclosure laws. The article advises checking online tools like Realtor.com and FEMA's maps, while cautioning that official maps can be outdated. It also covers the importance and potential cost of flood insurance, which is often not included in standard homeowner or renter policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is pursuing an unconventional trade policy by sending letters to foreign leaders, informing them of significant new tariff rates set to take effect on August 1. This approach follows a 90-day "pause" on global tariffs, during which few new trade deals were finalized, meaning rates are set to revert to higher levels for many nations. The letters introduce policy uncertainty but also leave room for negotiation, suggesting rates could be lowered if countries remove their own trade barriers. This article notes this is a radical departure from traditional trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad found that the plane's engines lost power because fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff. The crash on June 12 killed 260 people, including 19 on the ground, with only one passenger surviving. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they cut the fuel, with the second pilot denying he had done so. While the switches were moved back, only one engine regained thrust, which was insufficient to prevent the crash into a nearby hospital building.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has reportedly died from injuries sustained during an immigration enforcement raid at a California cannabis farm. The United Farm Workers union stated the worker died as a result of the enforcement action, during which about 200 undocumented migrants were arrested. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the man was not being pursued when he climbed onto a greenhouse roof and fell, and that medical aid was called immediately. The raid is part of a broader immigration crackdown, which prompted protests and a sharp response from President Trump.</p>

A late try from fly-half Cai Edwards, who scored 16 points in his first start, ultimately sealed the win for the tourists, leveling the series at 1-1. The emotional victory provides a welcome boost for the team and its interim head coach, Matt Sherratt.</p>

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is carefully managing its relationship with Donald Trump and the MAGA movement as it aims for the French presidency in 2027. Despite ideological alignment on issues like nationalism and anti-immigration, the party maintains a cautious distance, unlike other European populist leaders. This balancing act is shaped by a traditional French distrust of US influence, the potential negative impact of US tariffs on the party's blue-collar base, and broad French voter antipathy towards Trump. The party seeks to moderate its image to attract mainstream voters without alienating its core electorate.</p>

The controlled indoor environment, free of wind, changed the game's dynamics, leading to faster, more powerful rallies and higher jumps.

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to consider quotas for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate. Prien suggested a cap of 30-40% could be a "conceivable model" to improve educational outcomes, but the idea has faced sharp criticism. Opponents, including a head teacher from a school with over 80% immigrant students, argue it is impractical and stigmatizing, pointing instead to a lack of German language skills as the core issue. While some educators welcome the debate, they advocate for targeted support for schools rather than redistributing pupils.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in and around Grand Canyon National Park have forced the evacuation of all residents and visitors from the North Rim. One of the blazes, the Dragon Bravo Fire, was sparked by lightning and has been burning since July 4. A larger fire to the north, the White Sage Fire, has also led to evacuation orders and road closures near Jacob Lake. Firefighting efforts are being challenged by strong winds, low humidity, and critically dry conditions in rugged terrain. Other lightning-sparked fires have also forced the complete evacuation of a national park in Colorado.</p>

          <h2>Google Acquires Key AI Talent from Startup Windsurf in $2.4 Billion Deal</h2>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D employees in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. The agreement involves licensing fees for Windsurf's technology and compensation for the new hires, but is not an acquisition of the company itself. This move highlights the escalating "talent war" in the artificial intelligence sector, with major tech firms making massive investments to secure top researchers. The deal came after talks for OpenAI to acquire Windsurf for $3 billion reportedly fell through. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in several Southern California counties. The order responds to a lawsuit by advocacy groups alleging that federal agents have engaged in unconstitutional tactics, including racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The judge found there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims. This ruling directly impacts ongoing enforcement operations, including recent raids in Ventura County that led to mass arrests and clashes with protesters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following criticism that a new sandal design closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals, luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with artisanal footwear makers in India. The company held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents thousands of Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaboration opportunities. The controversy began after Prada showcased the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its cultural origins. The Chamber of Commerce is also now seeking to patent the traditional sandal design.</p>
