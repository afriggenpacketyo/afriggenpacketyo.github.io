          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, at the upcoming summit in The Hague. The U.S. has been pushing for allies to commit to this target, which includes 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some countries are close to meeting the 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago, others still lag behind, raising questions about whether these pledges will materialize into concrete action. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring these commitments, seeking long-term contracts to scale up production, but they remain in limbo between pledges and actual procurement.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran conflict has escalated with the U.S. military striking three Iranian nuclear sites, a move that has heightened tensions and left world leaders and investors on edge. Iran's parliament has voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil transit point, causing oil prices to jump more than 2%. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait, given China's status as Iran's largest oil customer. Analysts predict that oil prices could surge to $100 a barrel if the Strait is closed and Western forces attempt to reopen it, further destabilizing the global economy.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is considering canceling his attendance at an upcoming NATO summit, according to a government source. This decision comes as Japan grapples with regional tensions and domestic political challenges, including a recent record-low seat win for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in the Tokyo assembly election. The Japanese government has expressed some support for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, signaling Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Okinawa commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II battle, vowing to preserve the lessons of history and highlighting the ongoing burden of U.S. bases on the island.</p>

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key Belarusian opposition figure, was unexpectedly released after five years in prison and reunited with his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in Lithuania. Tsikhanouski, who was arrested after planning to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in the 2020 election, described his imprisonment as torture, citing isolation, denial of medical care, and insufficient food. He credited U.S. President Donald Trump with aiding his release and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for supporting Lukashenko's regime. Despite his health issues, Tsikhanouski intends to resume his political activities and continue fighting for democratic change in Belarus, while supporting his wife's role as the leader of the Belarusian opposition.</p>

          <p>Detectives have renewed their appeal for information ten years after the murder of John "Goldfinger" Palmer, a notorious criminal with a history of fraud and connections to the underworld. Palmer was shot six times in his garden in 2015, and Essex Police believe his killing was a planned execution possibly linked to his fraud trial. Despite his criminal past, police acknowledge that Palmer was a father and partner, and his family deserves answers. The investigation has faced challenges, including an initial misassessment of his death as non-suspicious, but authorities hope that changing loyalties within the criminal community may lead to new information.</p>

          <p>An NHS psychiatrist in Scotland is planning to establish a ketamine clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital by the end of the year to treat severe depression. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy, and aims to provide an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with hard-to-treat depression. Ketamine, while not officially licensed for depression treatment, has shown effectiveness in making patients more receptive to psychotherapy. Concerns exist regarding the potential for misuse and side effects, but proponents argue that the controlled clinical setting and lower doses mitigate these risks.</p>

          <p>Western leaders are facing criticism for their passive response to the escalating conflict between the U.S. and Iran, with some observers arguing that they are failing to address the root causes of the crisis. Despite calls for diplomacy and de-escalation, these leaders are accused of enabling Israel's actions and perpetuating a biased view of Iran. The lack of a strong stance against violations of international law and human rights is seen as a betrayal of the values they claim to uphold. The article argues that this inaction stems from a deep-seated belief in Western supremacy and a disregard for the sovereignty and rights of non-Western nations.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a key demand of U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially marking a win for his administration. NATO countries are likely to commit to higher spending targets, driven by Secretary-General Mark Rutte's efforts and Germany's support. However, some European nations are hesitant about social cuts to fund new weapons, and there are concerns about the lack of focus on Ukraine's NATO aspirations. Despite these challenges, the summit aims to project a strong political alliance and deter Russia, though the declaration is expected to be concise to maintain Trump's interest.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran, was detained by ICE while still breastfeeding their 3-month-old baby, causing distress for her husband and children. Adrian Clouatre, the veteran, is struggling to care for his children without his wife and is worried about the impact on his newborn daughter. Paola Clouatre, a Mexican national, had been seeking a green card but was detained due to a deportation order from 2018 that she was unaware of. The case highlights concerns about the Trump administration's strict immigration enforcement policies and their impact on military families, with advocates arguing that ICE should exercise more discretion in such cases.</p>

          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that allows voters to rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate receives a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support, but it also introduces complexity and potential challenges for transparency and vote tabulation.</p>

Meanwhile, the UN nuclear watchdog chief struck a cautious tone, noting that it was not yet possible to assess the damage at the Fordo nuclear facility.
