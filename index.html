          <p>The Chinese government is evaluating potential tariff exemptions on certain crucial U.S. imports to mitigate the impact of retaliatory tariffs on Chinese businesses. According to the American Chamber of Commerce in China, officials are identifying American goods vital to supply chains and susceptible to trade barriers. Some companies have warned that a prolonged tariff war could force them to exit China, raising concerns about foreign direct investment. Lifesaving drugs and healthcare products are among the sectors of particular concern in this ongoing trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty in New York federal court to charges related to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The Justice Department intends to seek the death penalty, alleging the killing was ideologically motivated by Mangione's anger towards the health insurance industry and required substantial planning. Mangione's lawyers requested the judge to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, arguing that the attorney general prejudiced the jury pool with her public statements. The judge has cautioned lawyers to avoid public commentary that could impede Mangione's right to a fair trial.</p>

          <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin held three hours of "constructive" talks in Moscow, discussing the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. The US has not released details of the meeting, but President Trump hinted that a deal was close, while Ukrainian President Zelensky urged allies to apply more pressure on Russia. Zelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea of recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, but suggested "territorial issues" could be discussed if a "full and unconditional ceasefire" is agreed on. Trump has blamed Kyiv for starting the war, saying "I think what caused the war to start was when they [Ukraine] started talking about joining Nato."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to cancel over 1,500 student visas held by international students, announcing a new system for reviewing and terminating visas. This reversal comes after numerous lawsuits filed by students who claimed their legal right to study in the U.S. was rescinded with little explanation, causing panic and the threat of detention and deportation. The Justice Department stated that agencies will not make additional changes or further revocations until the new review process is complete. It is unclear how many student visa holders have left the country due to the initial cancellations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is investigating UC Berkeley over concerns that its foreign funding disclosures "may be incomplete or inaccurate." Education Secretary Linda McMahon has directed the agency's legal team to scrutinize the university's foreign funding, particularly after reports surfaced in 2023 that Berkeley failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars received from China. The investigation aligns with Trump's increasing scrutiny of foreign influence in U.S. higher education, aiming to ensure colleges fully disclose the source and purpose of foreign funding. The Education Department also initiated a records request into Harvard for foreign funding last week.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a major legal victory that significantly restricts compounding pharmacies from marketing or selling unapproved versions of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies of these drugs, which had become popular during shortages or when patients lacked insurance coverage. Novo Nordisk has filed over 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies to protect Americans from the health risks posed by these illegitimate drugs. The FDA can now take action against pharmacies making compounded versions of semaglutide, including product seizures and warning letters.</p>

Health officials emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine, while noting that decreased vaccination rates have contributed to the resurgence of this highly contagious disease.

The regulations aim to enhance public safety, foster innovation, and establish a robust framework for autonomous vehicle technology. The proposed rules require driverless vehicle makers to obtain permits for testing with a safety driver, then for driverless testing, and finally for deploying driverless vehicles in California. The new rules would also allow autonomous trucks to be tested on public roads and require AV makers to adhere to data-reporting requirements and comply with standards for interactions with first responders.</p>

          <p>The FBI arrested Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on obstruction charges for allegedly preventing the arrest of an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, by ICE agents at her courthouse. According to the FBI, Dugan "intentionally misdirected federal agents away" from Flores-Ruiz, who was later arrested. The FBI agent's statement says Dugan became visibly angry upon learning of the arrest warrant and escorted Flores-Ruiz out of the courtroom through a nonpublic area. Dugan was charged with two counts of obstruction and released after an initial court appearance.</p>

This is Allen's second 147 of the season and the fifth of his career. The maximum break earns Allen £45,000, which will be split if another player makes a 147 in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The publication of Joan Didion's posthumous work, 'Notes to John,' has reignited the debate about the ethics of publishing an author's unpublished writings after their death. The journal, detailing her therapy sessions from 1999 to 2003, focuses on her daughter Quintana's struggles with alcoholism and is addressed to her husband, John Gregory Dunne. Didion herself had previously written critically about posthumous publications, and her memoirs elided her daughter's addiction. While the publication offers a glimpse into Didion's pain, it raises questions about respecting an author's wishes and privacy.</p>

          <p>George Santos, the former Republican congressman from New York, has been sentenced to 87 months in federal prison for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos pleaded guilty to the charges last year, acknowledging his involvement in various deceptions, including lying to Congress, fraudulently collecting unemployment benefits, and misusing campaign donations. Judge Joanna Seybert, presiding over the case, noted that Santos was elected with words, most of which were lies.

While the U.S. stock market lost some steam, a decline in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in the U.S. dollar index offered some relief. (not investment advice)</p>
