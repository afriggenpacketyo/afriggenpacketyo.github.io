          <p>Raul Celis Lopez, a Peruvian journalist known for covering corruption and violence in Iquitos, was fatally shot by hitmen while traveling to work. The article notes that his personal belongings were untouched, suggesting a targeted execution. Press freedom organizations have condemned the killing, emphasizing the growing dangers faced by journalists reporting on sensitive issues in the Amazon region. This incident marks the second killing of a reporter in Peru this year, underscoring a decline in media freedom in the country, which has fallen significantly in the Press Freedom Index. Optimism surrounding press freedom in Peru is low.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is under scrutiny after Secretary Brooke Rollins confirmed the agency is seeking to fill critical positions shortly after paying 15,000 employees to resign through a deferred resignation program. Rollins acknowledged potential mistakes in the process but insisted key positions were not included in the second round of buyouts. However, reports from employees contradict this claim, stating that some positions were immediately re-advertised after resignations. This has raised questions about the efficiency and planning of the USDA's workforce management strategy, especially given the Trump administration's focus on downsizing the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>A coalition of blue states, led by California, Colorado, and Washington, is suing the Trump administration for halting the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which funds the expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions are unlawful and hinder states' efforts to promote EV adoption and combat climate change. The states claim that withholding these funds undermines their green economies and zero-emission vehicle standards. This legal challenge arises amidst rising tensions, with the FBI investigating vandalism against Tesla vehicles and charging stations linked to protests against Elon Musk's DOGE.</p>

          <p>In response to Republican-led bans on flying pride flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags as a workaround. Salt Lake City added pride, trans, and Juneteenth flags to its official city flag collection, while Boise retroactively designated the pride flag as an official city flag. These measures are a reaction to state laws restricting flag displays to official flags, such as the U.S. flag and state flag.

          <p>West Virginia coal miners are losing access to free black lung screenings due to budget cuts mandated by President Trump at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The cuts have led to job losses and concerns about the health and safety of miners, particularly younger workers. Former NIOSH scientist Catherine Blackwood expressed anger and worry about the impact of the cuts on worker safety. The Trump administration defends the cuts as eliminating wasteful bureaucracy, but critics argue they will endanger workers' lives and increase the cost of job-related injuries and illnesses.</p>

          <p>New York State experienced a significant increase in pediatric flu deaths during the 2024-25 flu season, with 25 children dying from influenza, the highest number in recent years. This rise is attributed to declining vaccination rates and the circulation of more intense flu strains. Only one of the 25 children who died was vaccinated, highlighting the importance of vaccination. The decline in flu vaccinations reflects a growing distrust of the scientific establishment and vaccine hesitancy.</p>

The author contends that the current system incentivizes charities to cater to wealthy donors, creating an uneven playing field. The author proposes replacing the charitable deduction with a system that provides the same federal subsidy to every donated dollar, regardless of the donor's income, such as a government matching program or a tax credit.</p>
