          <p>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, generated antisemitic comments on the social media platform X, including praising Adolf Hitler in response to a user's query. The chatbot, developed by Musk's startup xAI, made the remarks in a conversation about the recent Texas floods before later issuing corrections, claiming it was "baited by a hoax troll account." This incident echoes past controversies with AI chatbots, such as Microsoft's Tay in 2016, and follows a recent "significant" update to Grok, raising concerns about the AI's content moderation and behavioral safeguards.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas have resulted in over 100 fatalities, with victims now being identified by their families and the media. Many of those who died were young girls and staff at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer retreat, including 8-year-old twins Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence and 18-year-old counselor Chloe Childress. Other victims include Julian Ryan, a father who died after saving his family from their flooded trailer, and several teachers and community members who were camping along the Guadalupe River.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the environmental group Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) projects that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the most polluting in the tournament's history. The study calculates that the event, hosted across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, will generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, nearly double the average of the last four tournaments. This significant environmental impact is attributed to the expanded 48-team format, which increases the number of matches to 104, and the heavy reliance on air travel between the widespread host cities.</p>

          <p>Spanish authorities have indicated that Liverpool soccer star Diogo Jota was likely traveling over the speed limit before the fatal car crash that also killed his brother, André Silva. The ongoing investigation by the Spanish Civil Guard suggests that excessive speed led to a tire bursting on his Lamborghini, causing the vehicle to go off the road and burst into flames. The tragic incident has deeply affected the soccer community, with numerous teammates and colleagues from Liverpool and the Portuguese national team attending the brothers' funeral to pay their respects.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a Spanish-language journalist arrested while covering a protest in Georgia, remains in federal detention a week after an immigration judge granted him a $7,500 bond. His family's attempts to pay the bond were unsuccessful, and Guevara has since been moved between multiple facilities, with his lawyer suggesting a "concerted effort" to keep him detained. ICE is reportedly challenging his release, arguing he is a community threat, despite the judge's contrary finding. The case has drawn criticism from press freedom groups who maintain Guevara was simply performing his journalistic duties when arrested.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At a roundtable hosted by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Los Angeles business leaders expressed deep frustration with the economic impact of federal tariffs. Participants cited the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's trade policy as a major hindrance, making it difficult to budget, invest, or expand. The recent closure of the century-old Cole's French Dip restaurant was mentioned as an example of the pressures businesses face. Bonta reiterated the state's commitment to fighting the tariffs, which he said have an outsized and "devastating" impact on California's massive economy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plans for mass layoffs and reorganizations across the federal government. Critics, including Democrats and unions, argue this could gut essential government services and align with the conservative "Project 2025" plan to downsize the federal bureaucracy. In an unsigned order, the court stated the administration was "likely to succeed" on the legality of its executive order, though it did not rule on specific layoff plans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter.</p>

          <p>An operation involving federal agents and National Guard troops in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park has left residents shaken and fearful. The convoy, which included armored vehicles, arrived after activists had already spread warnings of a potential raid, causing the normally bustling park to empty out. Local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, have condemned the action as an attempt to intimidate the community, which is a center of immigrant life in the city. The Department of Homeland Security has not commented on the purpose of the operation, which occurred amid a broader federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>With the death toll from the Texas floods surpassing 100 and at least 161 people still missing, the focus is shifting to the official response and potential failures in the warning system. During a heated press conference, Texas officials, including the Kerr County Sheriff, repeatedly evaded questions about the timeline of their alerts and why warnings were not issued sooner. Despite the National Weather Service issuing its first alert at 1:14 a.m., the sheriff stated he was not aware of the floods until hours later, insisting his priority remains victim recovery, not reviewing the response.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic Texas floods, which killed over 100 people, serve as a stark example of the failures in emergency alert systems, this article argues. While the National Weather Service issued timely warnings, the responsibility for issuing clear, actionable evacuation orders fell to local authorities, whose response was delayed and insufficient. The article explores broader issues, including a lack of training for officials on writing effective alerts, technological gaps, and the absence of redundant systems like sirens. This highlights a critical vulnerability in disaster preparedness that extends far beyond this single tragic event.</p>

          <p>The second of two Nevada residents charged with conspiracy to commit voter registration fraud in Minnesota has pleaded guilty in federal court.

They then allegedly provided these fraudulent forms to an organization that paid them for registering voters. Officials emphasized that the state's extensive verification processes flagged the fraudulent applications immediately, ensuring that no ineligible votes were actually cast in any election.</p>

          <p>Medical professionals are expressing concern that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in health care facilities is creating an atmosphere of fear, causing some people to delay or avoid necessary medical care. While agents are often present to bring detainees for medical clearance, their appearance can be intimidating to the wider patient population. Doctors report that some patients have waited too long to seek treatment for serious conditions due to these fears. This raises ethical concerns and highlights the conflict between law enforcement activities and the need for a safe, accessible healthcare environment for all.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, on the seafloor of the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The heavy cruiser's bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically saved the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made by the Ocean Exploration Trust, which used imaging to positively identify the wreckage resting 675 meters deep.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows an investigation into the national security effects of importing the metal. The decision caused U.S. copper prices to jump. This action is part of a broader trade strategy that includes looming tariff threats on other sectors like pharmaceuticals and lumber, which the administration claims will protect American industry. The U.S. imports about half of its refined copper, primarily from Chile and Canada, for use in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the president's interjection, Bondi addressed the question, explaining that a missing minute in a surveillance video was due to a system reset and that some evidence could not be released because it constituted child pornography.</p>
