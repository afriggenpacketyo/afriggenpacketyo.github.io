          <p>A person from Yorkshire, UK, has died from rabies after being bitten or scratched by a stray dog while on holiday in Morocco. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has stated that there is no risk to the wider public, as rabies is not known to pass between people. Health workers and close contacts of the individual are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precaution. The UKHSA advises that anyone bitten, scratched, or licked by an animal in a country where rabies is present should wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek immediate medical advice.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that more Americans disapprove of President Trump's handling of immigration than approve. This comes as Trump met with his national security team to discuss options related to Iran, including potential military action against Iranian nuclear facilities. Senate Republicans are also working on changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to fund Trump's domestic agenda, which was narrowly passed by the House last month. The political climate remains tense as the administration navigates both domestic and international challenges. Optimism for the administration's immigration policies may be waning.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel have finalized their partnership, with U.S. Steel retaining its name and headquarters in Pittsburgh and steel production remaining in the United States. The partnership is projected to generate over 100,000 jobs and includes significant investments in U.S. steelmaking. The deal, initially proposed in 2023, faced national security concerns raised by then-President Biden but was later cleared by President Trump, who emphasized Nippon Steel's commitment to investing heavily in U.S. Steel's facilities rather than fully acquiring the company. The companies have also entered into a National Security Agreement, ensuring U.S. Steel's operational capacity and board composition.</p>

          <p>Residents in Iowa are expressing concerns about a potential connection between agricultural practices and the state's high cancer rates, which are the second-highest in the nation. A new research project is investigating environmental factors, including pesticides, herbicides, and nitrates from farm runoff, as possible causes. The focus on agriculture is controversial, given the industry's significant contribution to Iowa's economy, but many residents believe that the widespread use of chemicals may be contributing to the increasing number of cancer diagnoses. The research team plans to release initial findings later this year, aiming to inform policies that could reduce cancer rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing criticism for allegedly adopting authoritarian tactics similar to those of Donald Trump, despite campaigning against Trump-like policies. Critics argue that under the guise of standing up to Trump, Carney is implementing corporate giveaways and weakening environmental regulations. New legislation, such as the Building Canada Act, grants the cabinet power to waive federal laws for projects deemed in the "national interest," while the Safe Borders Act weakens refugee protections. These actions are raising concerns about the centralization of power and the erosion of Indigenous rights and environmental safeguards.</p>

          <p>An Iranian official warned that any U.S. intervention in the conflict with Israel would risk "all-out war" as the conflict intensifies. Israel has conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting retaliation from Iran, with missiles fired at Israeli cities. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that two centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit. The U.S. has sent additional warplanes to Europe, raising speculation about a greater role in the conflict. The ongoing exchange of fire has resulted in casualties on both sides, with civilians and military personnel affected.</p>

          <p>This article explores the life and legacy of Desi Arnaz, focusing on his contributions to television and his personal life with Lucille Ball. Arnaz's decision to film "I Love Lucy" on 35mm film enabled the creation of reruns and syndication, revolutionizing television economics. The show was created partly to save their marriage, and Arnaz's business acumen led to the creation of Desilu Studios, a major television production company. Despite his success, Arnaz struggled with personal issues, including alcoholism, which ultimately led to the end of his marriage with Ball.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has held Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier in contempt of court for continuing to enforce an immigration law that had been blocked by the court. Uthmeier reportedly defied the court order and boasted about it in media interviews. The judge accused Uthmeier of twisting the words of her order and instructed him to file bi-weekly reports informing her of any further arrests or detentions made in defiance of the restraining order. Uthmeier responded defiantly, stating he would not bow down to the judge's order.</p>

The Met Office requires a threshold temperature for at least three consecutive days to declare a heatwave. A recent study indicates an increasing risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK due to climate change.</p>
