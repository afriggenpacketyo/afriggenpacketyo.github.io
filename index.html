          <p>Following a record-breaking Powerball drawing where winning tickets were sold, a data analysis reveals significant disparities in take-home winnings based on state tax laws. Winners in states like California and Texas, which do not tax lottery prizes, receive the largest payouts after federal taxes are deducted. Conversely, states with high income tax rates, such as New York and Minnesota, see the lowest net winnings for jackpot recipients. The article breaks down the financial implications for winners depending on their location and choice between an annuity or a lump-sum payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, was convicted of murdering her husband, Todd, by setting their house on fire and then running him over with a van as he escaped in 2007. After her initial life sentence was overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel, she was retried. The case against her was largely circumstantial, involving conflicting testimonies about her marriage, finances, and actions on the day of the fire, with her sons believing she is guilty while her daughters maintain her innocence. A second jury found her guilty again, sending her back to prison for life.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a deal with the United States to release over 300 of its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle plant in Georgia. The raid, part of the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement agenda, targeted a manufacturing site still under construction. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained 475 people in total, sparking concern from Seoul, a key U.S. ally. South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home once administrative procedures are finalized.</p>

          <p>A draft of the new U.S. National Defense Strategy indicates a potential major policy shift within the Pentagon, prioritizing the protection of the homeland and the Western Hemisphere. This move could reduce focus on adversaries like China and Russia, causing concern among allies such as Taiwan. According to a Politico report, the change suggests that long-standing U.S. security promises are being re-evaluated. This potential pivot away from global commitments is interpreted by some as a signal of a decline in U.S. power and could have significant geopolitical implications for regions relying on American military support.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell has expressed that he probably should have played more during a challenging first home summer in his international career. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who had an impressive debut Test series last winter, found himself in a limited role this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his spot in the Test XI and was used sparingly. Bethell acknowledged the lack of match time but stated he will learn from the experience and views the break as potentially beneficial for his future.</p>

          <p>Bishop Robert Barron has criticized Democratic Senator Tim Kaine for his comments challenging the principle that human rights are God-given rather than government-granted. Kaine had called the idea "extremely troubling" and compared it to theocratic rule. Barron counters that this concept is a cornerstone of American democracy, citing Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, which states that rights are endowed by a Creator and are therefore "inalienable." He argues that if rights originate from the government, they can be arbitrarily taken away, a danger exemplified by 20th-century totalitarian regimes.</p>

This lack of outreach casts doubt on the administration's efforts to uncover the full extent of Epstein's network and activities. Lawyers for the survivors express frustration, stating that victims are being ignored and that the government appears more interested in whitewashing the previous investigation than in seeking justice.

          <p>An increasing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers now in such a status. While these tools can prevent default and its severe credit consequences, they come with potential costs. During most forbearances, interest continues to accrue, significantly increasing the total debt over time. Deferments may be a better option for those with subsidized loans, as the government often covers the interest.

          <p>President Trump's intensified deportation efforts, combined with already low U.S. birth rates, could potentially cause the first recorded population decline in American history. An analysis suggests that if net immigration falls significantly due to these policies, it may not be enough to offset the small natural increase of births over deaths. This demographic shift could have profound economic consequences, particularly in sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which heavily rely on immigrant labor. The article explores the paradox that while many voters oppose high immigration, the economic effects of mass deportations could be even more disruptive.</p>

          <p>Marc Pierrat, diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD), offers a rare personal perspective on the disease's impact on his mind and identity. FTD has eroded his ability to process information and regulate emotions, transforming him from a meticulous engineer into someone who feels he has lost his sense of self. His wife, Julia, has become his full-time caregiver, navigating the emotional toll and logistical challenges of the disease. The article highlights the profound changes FTD brings, destroying personality and relationships, and chronicles the couple's journey as they cope with the slow, heartbreaking loss while preserving their love and connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syrians are enduring a severe cash crunch, forcing them to wait in long lines for hours at banks to withdraw minimal amounts of money, often just a fraction of their salaries. The crisis stems from a crippled economy, international sanctions, and a shortage of physical banknotes following the ousting of Bashar Assad's regime. Withdrawal limits have paralyzed daily life and commerce, with both state-owned and private banks often running out of cash. Many citizens are turning to informal money changers, while the new government promotes an e-payment app that raises security and monopoly concerns among economic experts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Utah judge has invalidated the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of voters who had established an independent redistricting commission. In 2018, voters approved a measure to end gerrymandering, but lawmakers ignored it and passed a map that heavily favored the GOP by splitting Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County. The ruling, which orders a new map to be drawn, is a significant victory for voting rights advocates. It stands in contrast to a national trend where both parties are increasingly attempting to draw partisan maps to secure electoral advantages.</p>

          <p>London Underground staff have begun a five-day strike, causing significant disruption across the transport network. Members of the RMT union are taking rolling action due to a dispute over pay and what they term "fatigue management," demanding a 32-hour work week. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the shorter work week as unaffordable. The strike will result in little to no service on the Tube from Monday to Thursday, with other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground expected to be much busier than usual.</p>

          <p>In a speech, UK Ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson described President Donald Trump as a necessary "risk-taker" who is challenging a failing status quo. He argued that Trump's "America First" approach does not mean "America Alone" and that the president has brought new energy to resolving global conflicts. The core of Mandelson's speech was a call for a robust US-UK technology partnership focused on AI, quantum computing, and rare-earth minerals to compete with China. He suggested this alliance could be as vital as the security relationship forged during World War II, emphasizing that Brexit has made the UK a more attractive partner for US investors.</p>

          <p>The latest transfer window has highlighted the growing financial disparity between England's Premier League, which spent over £3 billion, and Spain's La Liga, with a comparatively modest £592 million outlay. This gap is largely due to La Liga's strict economic controls, implemented in 2013 to ensure financial sustainability after numerous clubs faced bankruptcy. While these rules have stabilized the league and attracted investors, they have also limited spending power. Despite the financial constraints, Spanish clubs continue to perform strongly in European competitions, leveraging robust youth academies to remain competitive against their wealthier English counterparts.

          <p>The company Pray.com is using artificial intelligence to create cinematic videos depicting biblical stories, which have gained millions of views on social media platforms. The project, called The AI Bible, aims to engage a younger audience by presenting scripture with a modern, action-movie aesthetic, described by the company as the "Marvel Universe of faith." While the videos are popular, they have drawn criticism from some theologians who argue that they reduce complex spiritual texts to mere entertainment and fantasy. This has sparked a broader conversation about the role of technology in religious education and whether such adaptations honor or undermine the source material.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across parts of the United Kingdom, turning the full moon a reddish color in an event commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. The red hue is caused by sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere. While the full eclipse will be visible from 18:30 to 19:52 BST, viewing in the UK is dependent on local moonrise times, with eastern areas getting the best and longest view. The next total lunar eclipse visible from the UK will not occur until 2026.</p>

Known for his computer skills, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican in an effort to inspire faith among young people. The process required proof of two miracles attributed to his intercession. His preserved body lies in Assisi, Italy, which has become a major pilgrimage site, while the London church where he was baptized now holds a shrine in his honor.</p>

After a high-speed chase, San Diego vanished, leaving behind what agents described as a "bomb-making lab" in his car. He was discovered last year living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales.

          <p>Taiwan is advancing its military strategy by developing a new class of low-cost, long-range suicide drones as an affordable alternative to expensive cruise missiles. This initiative, which includes the Chien Feng IV drone, is part of a collaboration with U.S. defense company Kratos and aims to bolster Taiwan's ability to counter mainland China's military arsenal. The new drones reportedly have a range of at least 1,000 km, enabling them to strike deep within mainland China.
