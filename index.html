          <p>Authorities in Turks and Caicos have officially identified a body discovered earlier this month as that of Brian Tarrence, a missing American tourist from New York. An autopsy revealed no signs of trauma, and foul play is not currently suspected, though final toxicology reports are still pending to complete the investigation into his death. Tarrence, who was vacationing with his wife, was last seen on surveillance footage walking away from his hotel on June 25. The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force extended condolences to his family during this difficult time.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for stricter pricing oversight in the nation's electric vehicle industry to combat intense price wars that are contributing to deflationary pressures on the economy. During a high-level meeting, Li emphasized the need for enhanced cost supervision and price monitoring, urging major automakers to practice self-discipline rather than engaging in destructive competition. This move addresses growing concerns about oversupply and its negative impact on industrial profits, which fell significantly in May. Officials also stressed the need to boost domestic consumption to alleviate strain on business margins. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's labor market is continuing to weaken, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The annual rate of wage growth slowed to 5% in the three months to May, down from 5.2% previously, indicating a cooling trend. Concurrently, the number of job vacancies has declined for three consecutive years, now standing at 727,000. The ONS report suggests that some businesses are hesitating to recruit new employees or replace those who leave, reflecting broader economic uncertainty and a potential slowdown in hiring activity across the country.

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year surge in its second-quarter net profit, significantly outperforming market estimates. This record-breaking performance is primarily driven by the sustained, robust demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Advanced chips, those 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted 74% of the company's total wafer revenue. However, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer faces potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies and export controls affecting its business with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a 2 trillion euro budget for the seven-year period beginning in 2028, featuring a significant increase in defense and space investment. The plan allocates 131 billion euros to these sectors, a fivefold increase from current levels, reflecting a strategic shift towards rearmament amid geopolitical concerns. The budget framework, which amounts to 1.26% of the EU's gross national income, also dedicates 35% to climate initiatives and triples funding for migration management.

          <p>A man has died and thirteen other people, including a seven-year-old, were injured after a lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey. The incident occurred during a children's archery competition when, according to a witness, the sky was clear and there was no sign of a storm. The deceased, identified as 61-year-old Robert Montgomery, was a volunteer club member. The injured were transported to local hospitals for treatment, with at least one person suffering burns. This marks the third serious lightning strike incident in the tri-state area in the past month.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plummeted over 7% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's management as the reason for terminating the bid. In response, Seven & i expressed disappointment and disagreed with what it called inaccurate statements from the Canadian firm. The failed deal highlights the challenges foreign companies face with acquisitions in Japan, with one analyst noting that the "moat of Japanese protectionism" proved too difficult to overcome.

The prince emphasized that children should not have to live in fear and highlighted the ongoing threat posed by these remnants of war. The Halo Trust has cleared 120,000 landmines in Angola, continuing the work his mother brought to global attention.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the second straight month in June, falling 0.5% year-over-year and fueling fears of a potential recession for the export-dependent economy. The decline was driven by a sharp 11.4% drop in shipments to the United States, its key trading partner, as a 25% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports looms. Auto exports to the U.S. were hit particularly hard, plunging 26.7% as carmakers appeared to absorb the tariff costs to maintain market share. The data underscores the severe economic pressure on Japan as trade negotiations with the U.S. have yet to produce a breakthrough. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst" criminals, newly obtained data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows a different reality. Of the approximately 70,583 convicted criminals deported in the first half of the year, only 729, or less than 1%, had homicide convictions. The data, broken down by conviction type, indicates that many documented infractions were for non-violent offenses such as traffic violations. This analysis suggests that the administration's deportation push has broadly targeted undocumented immigrants, rather than being narrowly focused on those with violent criminal records as publicly stated.</p>

The legality of the president firing a Fed chair is unclear and would likely result in a court battle that could reach the Supreme Court. The speculation follows months of Trump's public criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates, creating uncertainty about the independence of the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been canceled following a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. However, the threat was later downgraded and then canceled as officials determined that large, widespread waves were not expected due to the earthquake's shallow depth. The region is part of the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," and multiple aftershocks were reported following the main event.</p>
