        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, potentially ending nearly two weeks of escalating air assaults. The agreement involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran and followed by Israel, after which the war would be officially declared over, according to Trump. However, neither Israeli nor Iranian officials immediately commented on the proposal, and Iran's foreign minister initially denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement. Despite the uncertainty, Trump congratulated both countries on their "stamina, courage, and intelligence" in ending what he termed "THE 12 DAY WAR."</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States’ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, although there were no reported casualties. This attack occurred amidst President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, preventing any casualties at the base. The strikes and subsequent ceasefire announcement followed a period of escalating tensions after Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear program, raising concerns about potential escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>The article explores the enduring mystery of D.B. Cooper, who hijacked a Northwest Orient flight in 1971, demanding $200,000 and four parachutes before jumping from the plane and vanishing. Despite extensive investigations, neither Cooper nor the majority of the ransom money has ever been found, fueling numerous theories about his identity and fate. Some believe he was a former paratrooper, while others suggest he was inspired by a Franco-Belgian comic book series featuring a heroic test pilot named Dan Cooper. The case remains captivating due to its audacity and the lack of a definitive resolution, drawing in amateur sleuths and podcasters who are determined to uncover the truth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1", the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which represents a significant advancement in using light for simultaneous computations. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, rivaling the performance of advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development is particularly crucial as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. Optical computing offers inherent advantages like ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, positioning it as a vital future direction for AI and data centers.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant declines, dropping below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran. The market sell-off suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some analysts suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the U.S. to avoid casualties and calling for peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's rare earth exports to China have significantly increased since 2018, peaking in 2023, and are particularly rich in heavy rare earth elements, which are less abundant and more valuable. However, the rare earth extraction in Myanmar, primarily from the Kachin State, has raised environmental concerns and supply chain risks due to the ongoing civil war. Disruptions caused by armed groups seizing mining sites have led to price spikes in heavy rare earths, highlighting China's vulnerability in relying on the unstable region.</p>

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, stating that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups have denounced the decision, arguing it will harm wildlife habitats, water sources, and recreational opportunities. The decision aligns with President Trump's efforts to expand mining, logging, and drilling on public lands.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning. This decision lifts an injunction issued by a federal District Court judge in Massachusetts. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision as a "gross abuse" of the Court's discretion. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling as a victory for American safety and security. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump took a gamble by inserting the US into the conflict between Israel and Iran, which may have resulted in a ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire that could lead to a lasting peace. If Trump has ended what he labeled the "12 Day War", it would be a significant step back from the brink of a conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that if Israel stops its aggression, Iran would cease its response, seemingly leading to a de-escalation of tensions.</p>
