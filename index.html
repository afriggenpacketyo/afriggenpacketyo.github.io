        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump asserted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has the power to end the conflict with Russia "almost immediately." In a social media post preceding a high-stakes meeting in Washington, Trump outlined terms mirroring Kremlin demands, including Ukraine refraining from joining NATO and foregoing any claim to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. These comments follow Trump's recent discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and set a contentious tone for the upcoming summit with Zelenskyy and European leaders, where a potential peace deal will be the central topic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has conceded to allowing the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This potential breakthrough, reportedly discussed during the recent summit with President Trump, could address Ukraine's security concerns without formal NATO membership, a long-standing Russian objection. While European leaders welcomed the development, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy noted that the practical details of such a guarantee remain unclear, emphasizing the need for a security framework that works in practice to prevent future aggression.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, several key European and NATO leaders will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his meeting with President Trump at the White House. This collective move is seen as an effort to support Zelenskyy and present a united European front, ensuring Ukraine is not pressured into an unfavorable peace deal with Russia. The presence of leaders from the European Commission, NATO, France, and Germany underscores Europe's determination to have a voice in the negotiations, particularly after Zelenskyy was excluded from Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Pratt shared a series of rare photos on social media to celebrate his son Jack's 13th birthday, marking his official entry into the teenage years. The "Guardians of the Galaxy" star posted images of them enjoying activities like baseball games and welding, expressing his pride in the young man his son is becoming. Pratt, who shares Jack with his ex-wife Anna Faris, has previously spoken about how his son's premature birth and early health scares profoundly deepened his religious faith, a theme he referenced in his birthday tribute.</p>

          <p>China has issued its annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing the U.S. of hypocrisy and using the issue as a "bargaining chip" in political power games. The document criticizes the American political system for being controlled by money, alleges widespread racism, and points to social inequality and the politicization of immigration. Released amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, the report frames the U.S. as a deeply unequal society where human rights are treated as "props for political theatre" rather than genuine principles.</p>

          <p>The federal law enforcement presence in Washington D.C. is set to increase as West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have committed to deploying hundreds of their National Guard troops. This expansion is part of President Trump's initiative to address what his administration has described as rising crime in the nation's capital. However, the move has been met with criticism from crime prevention workers who argue that such deployments do little to solve systemic issues, while several Democratic mayors have vowed to legally challenge any similar rollouts in their cities.</p>

The core challenge for Zelenskyy and his European allies will be to steer Trump back toward a unified Western stance without alienating him, as fundamental disagreements over the conflict's goals hang in the balance.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist Croatian singer Thompson has exposed deep-seated divisions within the country over its history and national identity. The event featured the controversial chant "Za dom, spremni" ("For homeland, ready!"), which is associated with the country's World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha regime. While supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, human rights groups have condemned it as a neo-fascist salute that promotes a dangerous wave of nationalism.</p>

          <p>Nearly a quarter-century after the September 11th attacks, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its mission to identify victims, using new technology to analyze remains once thought unidentifiable. This ongoing effort recently led to the first-time identification of John Niven, a victim from the South Tower, bringing a form of closure to his family after 22 years. The article highlights the meticulous work of forensic scientists who have promised to continue testing thousands of remaining fragments for the roughly 1,100 victims yet to be identified.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years due to a plummeting birth rate and one of the world's longest life expectancies. Last year, deaths outnumbered births by more than two to one, prompting concerns about the nation's economy, military, and social fabric. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a city-run dating app and shortened workweeks to encourage marriage and family formation, while some politicians advocate for revitalizing rural areas to make them more attractive for young families.</p>

The event also saw European veterans Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter perform well enough to avoid relegation from the tour for the next season.</p>

The negotiations involved high-level officials, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, who were tasked with navigating the complex and often tense economic relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A National Guard spokesperson has stated that its members deployed in Washington D.C. as part of a federal policing surge "may be armed consistent with their mission." This marks a significant development, as the Army had previously indicated that the troops would not carry weapons or have the authority to make arrests. The potential for armed soldiers on city streets has intensified the controversy surrounding the deployment, which critics, including D.C.'s mayor, have labeled a federal overreach, while supporters see it as a necessary step to combat crime.</p>
