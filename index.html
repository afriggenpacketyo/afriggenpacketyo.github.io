          <p>China has successfully tested its HarmonyOS in space, reducing reliance on foreign software for small satellites. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS), a lightweight version of Huaweiâ€™s platform, was evaluated on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat. The satellite demonstrated faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous setups. Following the Lianli mission, national technical standards are proposed to guide OpenHarmony's use in small satellites, encouraging broader adoption across commercial and research missions within China. This represents a fully home-grown hardware-software solution for spacecraft operating systems.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a patient with escalating heart issues and an LVAD, faced a high risk of organ rejection while awaiting a heart transplant at the Mayo Clinic. Doctors proposed an unprecedented heart-liver transplant to address her antibody problem, as the liver helps lower the risk of rejection. The surgery was successful, proving that placing a liver and a heart from the same donor can bring antibodies close to zero. After a long recovery, Baker now advocates for others needing transplants, finding solace in knowing her case has opened opportunities for more LVAD patients to receive life-saving treatment, despite facing financial struggles following her husband's sudden death. The patient's courage has paved the way for additional surgeries of this nature.</p>

          <p>The article explores the rise of "SkinnyTok," a community on social media promoting extreme thinness, led by influencers like Liv Schmidt. This trend marks a backlash against the body positivity movement, fueled by the popularity of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. SkinnyTok influencers advocate for restrictive eating habits and emphasize the social advantages of being thin, attracting both praise and criticism. The author reflects on how this content has influenced her own body image and connects SkinnyTok to broader issues of misogyny, political undertones, and the alt-right pipeline, while also highlighting the personal motivations and directness of some influencers within the community.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested while protesting the detention of an undocumented man by ICE agents at a federal courthouse. Lander, who is also a mayoral candidate, was charged with assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, though video evidence contradicts the assault claim. The article highlights the increasing trend of ICE agents targeting undocumented migrants at courthouses and the broader issue of immigration enforcement tactics. It contrasts the Democratic establishment's uneasiness with the protests against these tactics with the author's call for a stronger defense of democracy against authoritarianism, noting Lander's actions as an example of standing up for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP), according to a Japan-U.S. diplomatic source. This request is likely to prompt Tokyo to cancel a planned high-level meeting with Washington. The increased demand follows previous calls for Japan to raise its defense spending to 3% of GDP. Japan had previously decided to double its annual defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027, a significant shift in its postwar security policy. Trump continues to assert that the U.S.-Japan security treaty is one-sided, potentially leading to demands for Tokyo to pay more for American troops stationed in Japan.</p>

          <p>The article accuses legacy media outlets of biased coverage by ignoring a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on President Joe Biden's mental fitness. The author contrasts this with the extensive coverage given to Democratic-led hearings, such as the House Special Committee on the January 6 attack. Republican witnesses criticized the media's lack of curiosity about Biden's failures, while broadcast networks prioritized other stories like a not-guilty verdict in a Massachusetts case. The author concludes that the media's selective coverage underscores the importance of conservative media in reporting on issues that liberals allegedly want to bury.</p>

Additionally, the global implications of a U.S. intervention in Iran are viewed as a victory for anti-liberal forces worldwide.

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard now claims Iran could produce nuclear weapons within weeks, reversing her previous testimony before Congress. This shift follows President Trump's assertion that Iran possesses a "tremendous amount of material" and could develop a nuclear weapon within months. Gabbard's earlier testimony, where she stated Iran was not building nuclear weapons, was criticized by Trump. Iran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful. Gabbard now agrees with Trump's stance, citing US intelligence. Disagreement within Trump's "America First" movement exists over whether the US should strike Iran.</p>

          <p>The Japanese and Indian governments are arranging for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Japan in late August for talks with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The two leaders are expected to agree on India's adoption of a next-generation shinkansen bullet train being developed by East Japan Railway Co. for a high-speed rail project underway in western India. They may also agree to revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their security partnership amid China's increasing maritime prowess.

This capability could give the Chinese navy a first-mover advantage in combat. The report highlights the historic leap in China's aircraft carrier technology as it enters a critical phase of combat capability development. The Fujian is expected to be commissioned by the end of the year, joining the Liaoning and Shandong to form a three-carrier fleet for the Chinese navy, signaling a significant advancement in China's naval power.</p>

The author notes that Trump's base is largely against further involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts, and that the Democratic party is similarly divided.

Near-daily patrols have become routine since 2021, with a sharp increase after William Lai Ching-te assumed office.
