          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth outlined the Trump administration's military priorities, focusing on re-establishing deterrence to ensure enemies are intimidated by American forces. Speaking at Fort Benning, he emphasized rebuilding the military with the best equipment and empowering soldiers by pushing decision-making authority down to lower levels. Hegseth's comments align with the administration's broader goal of restoring a "warrior mentality" and coincide with the move to rename the Pentagon the Department of War. He stressed that the world knows President Trump "means business."</p>

          <p>Sam Mihara, a 92-year-old survivor of the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, is sharing his story to ensure Americans remember the injustice of Japanese American internment during World War II. He was just nine years old when his family was forcibly removed from their San Francisco home and imprisoned in the Wyoming camp, where his grandfather died and his father went blind. More than 120,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated in such camps, a policy Mihara describes as racist. His reflections underscore the lasting trauma and discrimination caused by this historical injustice.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to enforce a policy preventing transgender and nonbinary individuals from obtaining passports that reflect their gender identity. The court upheld a lower court's injunction, which found the policy to be arbitrary and rooted in "unconstitutional animus" toward transgender Americans. The policy, part of a broader executive order recognizing only biological sex at birth, had reversed the previous allowance for an "X" gender marker. This ruling affirms that the government failed to justify the immediate and irreparable harm the policy would cause.</p>

The event, which Elon Musk was invited to but did not attend, aimed to foster closer ties between the administration and Silicon Valley. During the dinner, Gates spoke about advancements in vaccine technology, prompting Trump to defend Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "different take" on the subject. The gathering highlights the administration's efforts to encourage U.S. investment from major tech firms.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's central Hunan province are exploring a new application for the country's central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, to resolve persistent payment defaults. The plan involves using the digital yuan to clear "chain debts," where funds could be programmed to reach the final creditor directly. Analysts suggest this could leverage the currency's traceability to make complex payment relationships more transparent and enhance real-time control over transactions.

          <p>The California Highway Patrol is investigating an assault on a Lyft driver that was captured on his dashcam video. The footage shows a female passenger verbally harassing the driver with profane and xenophobic language before kicking him in the head while he was driving on a highway. The incident occurred near midnight on August 19 after the driver, identified only as Tinh, picked up two women who appeared to be intoxicated in Newport Beach. The assault began after he asked the woman to remove her feet from the car's center console for safety reasons.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order allowing the Department of Defense to use its historical name, the Department of War, as a secondary title. This move, which also permits the Defense Secretary to be called the Secretary of War, is framed as a way to project strength and a renewed focus on a "warrior ethos." While a permanent, legal name change requires congressional approval, the order authorizes immediate use in non-statutory contexts, aiming to signal readiness to adversaries. The historical context is that the original War Department was rebranded after World War II.</p>

          <p>Political scientist Sir John Curtice analyzes the sustained rise of Reform UK, which has been leading in British polls for five months, potentially positioning Nigel Farage to become the next prime minister. The party's success is attributed to capturing a large portion of the 2016 Brexit voter base by focusing on cultural issues like immigration, equalities policies, and climate change skepticism. This has fundamentally realigned the preferences of Leave voters away from the Conservative party. While the current fragmented political landscape benefits Reform, its long-term success may depend on Farage's continued leadership.</p>

The errors have caused some patients to be wrongly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and, in some cases, prescribed medication they did not need. NHS England confirmed that 16 hospital trusts used the affected machines, which produced biased results on haemoglobin A1C tests. Authorities are now recalling patients for repeat testing, and the manufacturer is working with regulators.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, expressed skepticism about the rapid adoption of agentic AI browsers in corporate environments. In an interview, he argued that unless these autonomous AI agents have robust security controls built around enterprise credentials, companies will not permit their use due to security risks. While Arora sees the consumer appeal of an AI that can autonomously book flights or make reservations, he believes they are "at odds with the enterprise." He highlighted the importance of identity security, noting that most breaches occur from credential theft.</p>

          <p>Jorma Taccone, a member of the comedy trio The Lonely Island and a former "Saturday Night Live" writer, is facing a long recovery after a serious accident. He fell 20 feet from a ladder at his Connecticut farmhouse, shattering his pelvis and detaching his sacrum. Speaking from his hospital bed on a podcast with his collaborators, Taccone recounted the fall, which occurred while he was hanging lights on a barn.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced a contentious Senate hearing where he defended recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director, Susan Monarez. Kennedy denied Monarez's claim that she was fired for refusing to pre-approve vaccine recommendations, instead asserting he dismissed her for being untrustworthy. Both Democrats and some Republicans, including Senator Bill Cassidy, challenged Kennedy on his vaccine policies and the resulting confusion over access to COVID-19 shots. The hearing was marked by combative exchanges, with Kennedy accusing senators of "making things up."</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has filed a lawsuit against the AI image generator Midjourney, accusing the company of blatant copyright infringement. The suit alleges that Midjourney's AI was trained on and produces unauthorized replicas of Warner's iconic characters, such as Batman, Superman, and Scooby-Doo. By taking this action, Warner Bros. joins Disney and Universal Pictures in a growing legal battle by major Hollywood studios to protect their intellectual property from generative AI.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the blockbuster trade of star defensive end Micah Parsons was a strategic financial decision based on "simple math." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking $186 million contract with the Green Bay Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the salary cap space saved by not paying Parsons' massive contract, combined with the value of the draft picks received, allows the team to afford multiple top-tier players. He emphasized the move was not personal but a calculated choice to spread resources.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's shares fell over 12% in after-hours trading despite beating second-quarter earnings estimates, as the company provided a full-year outlook that was significantly below Wall Street's expectations. The athletic apparel retailer attributed the reduced guidance to the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, which are expected to cost the company $240 million. CEO Calvin McDonald also acknowledged that some of the brand's product offerings, particularly in its lounge and social categories, have become "stale" and are not resonating with customers.

          <p>The debate over vaccines in the U.S. has escalated into a "proxy war" over trust, freedom, and government's role in public health, fueled by policy shifts under Health Secretary Robert F.

This fragmentation is exemplified by the recent firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, which sparked outrage in a heated Senate hearing.

The company's AI-related revenue jumped 63% to $5.2 billion during the period, and CEO Hock Tan projected it would reach $6.2 billion in the next quarter.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at a maximum temperature of 82 degrees or below. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes as climate change increases the frequency of deadly heat waves. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, particularly for vulnerable populations, as sustained indoor heat is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths. The Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles opposes the measure, citing concerns about increased costs.</p>
