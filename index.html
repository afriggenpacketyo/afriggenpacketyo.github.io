          <p>Artificial intelligence company OpenAI is substantially increasing the size of its secondary share sale from an initial $6 billion to approximately $10.3 billion. This offering allows eligible current and former employees to sell their stock at a company valuation of $500 billion, a significant increase from its previous $300 billion valuation earlier in the year. The transaction, which includes investors like SoftBank and Thrive Capital, provides liquidity for employees without the immediate pressure of an initial public offering. The deal is expected to close in October, following a trend among high-value startups to offer periodic equity sales for staff.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has officially identified the remains of Jerome M. Mullaney, a U.S. Navy seaman who was 18 when he was killed in World War II. Mullaney died in June 1944 when his ship, the USS Glennon, struck an underwater mine off the coast of France two days after participating in the D-Day invasion. His remains were recovered in 1957 but could not be identified at the time and were interred in Belgium. Through modern DNA analysis and other scientific methods, his identity was confirmed in March 2025, bringing long-awaited closure to his surviving family members.</p>

          <p>A recent survey from accounting firm PwC suggests that American consumers are planning to decrease their holiday spending by an average of 5%, the most significant drop since 2020. The projected reduction, bringing the average individual's budget to $1,552, is attributed to persistent inflation and economic uncertainty. Gen Z is expected to cut back the most, with a planned 23% reduction in their holiday budgets. The report indicates that consumers are becoming more deliberate with their purchases, actively seeking discounts and planning to do a large portion of their shopping between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliations. The court ruled that the current situation does not legally constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the required threshold for invoking the wartime statute. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy to remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without standard due process. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling for reining in executive overreach, while the White House has vowed to continue fighting the decision.</p>

          <p>Republicans on the House Budget Committee are reportedly in the early stages of planning a second budget reconciliation bill, with a focus on implementing further reforms to Medicaid. Discussions are expected to revisit measures that were not included in the first reconciliation package signed into law in July. The committee's chairman, Rep. Jodey Arrington, confirmed that the process is underway and suggested that proposals could include blocking federal funds for transgender medical procedures and for illegal immigrants.

          <p>Stage 11 of the Vuelta a España cycling race was abruptly ended three kilometers from the finish line in Bilbao due to safety concerns arising from pro-Palestinian protesters. Race organizers made the decision to neutralize the stage, meaning no official winner was declared, though points for mountain and sprint classifications were awarded. This incident follows other disruptions targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team during the event, including a crash involving a rider in a previous stage. Riders and the sport's governing body, the UCI, expressed significant disappointment and condemned the actions that compromised athlete safety and the integrity of the competition.</p>

          <p>Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, announced that the state will work to eliminate all vaccine mandates, including long-standing requirements for children to attend public school. If successful, Florida would become the first state in the nation to remove such public health requirements for diseases like polio, measles, and mumps. Ladapo, a known critic of vaccines, characterized the mandates as dripping with "disdain and slavery." The move was immediately condemned by public health experts and the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warned it would put children at higher risk of infectious diseases and could create a public health disaster.</p>

Newsmax also claims Fox News has used intimidation tactics, such as hiring private investigators to target its executives.

While visually stunning, particularly during the tornado scene, the review notes that the high-definition spectacle can sometimes detract from the film's original emotional depth and charm.

Beijing considers self-governed Taiwan a renegade province and has ordered its military to be capable of an invasion by 2027. However, the report suggests a less alarmist approach would better serve U.S. interests as Congress finalizes its annual defense authorization bill, which includes measures aimed at countering China.</p>

          <h2>Cardi B Throws Pen at Man Who Asked Disrespectful Question About Pregnancy</h2>

          <p>While leaving a courthouse, rapper Cardi B confronted a man in a press pool who asked an invasive question about pregnancy rumors involving her ex-husband Offset and current boyfriend Stefon Diggs. The man asked if she foresaw "any paternity issues," prompting Cardi B to take a pen from a fan and hurl it in his direction. She repeatedly told him he was being disrespectful and questioned why he felt entitled to ask such a personal question. The incident occurred during a break in her civil assault trial, where she was ultimately found not liable on all counts.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Earnings: $25,000 in a CD vs. a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 14:15:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on traditional savings accounts remaining low, savers with a significant sum like $25,000 should consider higher-earning options such as Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A comparison shows that while a high-yield savings account currently offers a slightly higher rate, the earnings difference over a year is minimal, around $25. The key distinction is that CD rates are fixed, guaranteeing a return, whereas high-yield savings rates are variable and likely to decrease with expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Savers must weigh the potential for slightly higher but uncertain returns against the security of a locked-in rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for a vacant Federal Reserve Governor position, has vowed to protect the central bank's independence and adhere to its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. In remarks prepared for his Senate confirmation hearing, Miran, who currently serves as a close economic advisor to Trump, emphasized that his decisions would be based on macroeconomic analysis. His nomination comes amid concerns that the president seeks to exert more influence over the Fed's monetary policy, particularly its decisions on interest rates. Miran will serve out a term that expires in January 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Long-term studies of survivors of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, have revealed a surprising psychological outcome known as post-traumatic growth. While many survivors suffered from lasting PTSD and depression, a significant percentage also reported positive personal changes, such as a greater appreciation for life, improved relationships, and increased personal strength. Researchers found that this growth often coexisted with post-traumatic stress, and was more likely among those who had strong social support and a sense of self-efficacy. These findings offer hopeful lessons on resilience and recovery in the face of catastrophic events.</p>

The company's head of R&D, Martin Holst Lange, stated the pill demonstrated weight loss of up to 16.6% in trials, comparable to the injectable version, with a favorable safety profile. While the pill requires being taken on an empty stomach, the company believes it will provide a crucial alternative for patients who prefer not to use injections.</p>

Ahead of the talks, Sánchez criticized Western policy on Gaza as a "failure" that risks damaging its global credibility, highlighting a potential point of divergence with the UK.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 on September 17, mortgage rates may begin to fall before the official decision. Mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly tied to, the Fed's policy, and lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of a central bank move. This pattern was observed last year when rates dropped just before a Fed cut was issued. With the probability of a reduction now over 95%, lenders are likely to start pricing in the change, potentially offering relief to homebuyers sooner than the formal announcement.

While he mentioned a "light at the end of the tunnel" if common sense prevails, his statement underscores a hardline stance.
