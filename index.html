          <p>A new poll reveals low approval ratings for Elon Musk's performance in the Trump administration, largely due to public resistance against significant government cuts spearheaded by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.  The poll highlights strong disapproval of job layoffs and agency closures, with Musk's approval rating significantly lower among those opposing these measures.  Partisanship plays a role, with Republicans showing higher approval than Democrats and Independents.  Musk's declining popularity mirrors President Trump's own low approval ratings.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives is causing significant disruption within US police departments.  The threat of losing federal funding is forcing some departments to roll back DEI programs, potentially hindering efforts to diversify police forces and improve community relations.  Experts warn that this backlash could negatively impact police culture and lead to increased abuse of underrepresented groups.  The historical context shows that efforts to diversify policing have always faced resistance.</p>

          <p>Mark Leyse warns of a potential nuclear disaster in the US due to the vulnerability of power grids and nuclear plants to severe solar storms.  A prolonged power outage could disable the cooling systems of nuclear plants, leading to core damage and the release of radioactive material.  The author emphasizes the risk of a disaster far exceeding Chernobyl, particularly due to the dense packing of spent nuclear fuel in storage pools.  Leyse advocates for the swift transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage to mitigate this risk.</p>

These cicadas, known for their loud buzzing and synchronized emergence, will be primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller populations in other East Coast states.  Their emergence is triggered by soil temperatures reaching 64 degrees.  The life cycle of periodical cicadas involves 13 or 17 years underground before a synchronized emergence for mating and egg-laying.</p>
