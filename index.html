        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Harvard study analyzing data from over 66,000 nurses over two decades reveals a significant link between experiencing stalking and an increased risk of heart disease. The research, published in *Circulation*, found that women who had been stalked had a 41% higher risk, while those who obtained a restraining order faced a 70% higher risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings persisted even after accounting for other lifestyle factors like diet and exercise. Researchers suggest these common experiences of violence should be considered alongside traditional risk factors in medical screenings to improve women's long-term health outcomes.</p>

          <p>As astronomical autumn begins on September 22, skygazers can look forward to several notable celestial events during the longer nights. Saturn will be at its brightest and closest to Earth on September 21, appearing in opposition and making it easily visible to the naked eye, though a telescope is needed to see its rings. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November. The shower is expected to peak around October 22 under ideal viewing conditions due to a new moon, promising fast-moving meteors with long streaks of light.</p>

          <p>Three elderly nuns, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly fled a Catholic care home and returned to their former convent in Elsbethen, Austria, with help from former students and a locksmith. The nuns—Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita—claim they were moved against their will from the Kloster Goldenstein convent where they had spent most of their lives. Church authorities have called the move "incomprehensible," citing the nuns' health and the unsuitable living conditions in the now-unmaintained convent. Despite the lack of initial utilities, the nuns are receiving support from the community and are determined to remain in their lifelong home.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in Franklin Park, Illinois, after he allegedly resisted arrest and attempted to drive his vehicle into the agents. According to the Department of Homeland Security, one agent was struck and dragged by the vehicle, prompting the officer to open fire in self-defense. The suspect's vehicle then crashed, and he was later pronounced dead at a hospital, while the injured agent is in stable condition.

          <p>In the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, AI tools like X's Grok rapidly spread misinformation, including misidentifying the suspect and generating altered photos of the real person of interest. A CBS News analysis found numerous instances where Grok provided incorrect information about the suspect's identity, political affiliation, and even falsely reported that Kirk was still alive after his death was confirmed. Other AI services, such as Perplexity and Google's AI Overview, also produced inaccurate details, highlighting the unreliability of generative AI in providing factual, real-time information during breaking news events. Experts note that these systems prioritize probable text generation over fact-checking, which can amplify confusion.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian businessman in Tulkarm, in the occupied West Bank, alleges that Israeli soldiers occupied his family's home for over three months, vandalized it, and then set it on fire. Nasser Faratawi stated that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took over his property in March during a military operation in the nearby refugee camp, using it as a base. Upon returning, he found extensive damage, graffiti, and destruction, with his business warehouse and shop completely burned. The IDF told the BBC it was "not aware of any arson committed by its troops" and that a complaint is under review, while noting that using homes as temporary bases is sometimes an operational necessity.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from Policy in Practice indicates that seven million households across England, Scotland, and Wales are failing to claim a total of £24 billion in available financial support. The unclaimed aid includes government benefits like universal credit and pension credit, as well as local assistance such as free school meals and social tariffs from utility providers. According to the report, the primary barriers preventing people from accessing this support are a lack of awareness, the complexity of the application processes, and the social stigma associated with claiming benefits. The research highlights a growing issue, with the total amount of unclaimed support rising from an estimated £19 billion two years ago.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of Tyler Robinson for the assassination of Charlie Kirk, legal analyst Phil Holloway has called for further investigation into potential co-conspirators. Holloway pointed to reports that Robinson communicated with others on the Discord app about the crime and was provided with the rifle, suggesting a criminal conspiracy. He argued that anyone who knew of the plan or provided encouragement or material support, like the weapon, could be held criminally liable. While Utah's governor stated that no additional arrests were expected, Holloway insists that authorities should investigate how Robinson obtained the firearm, which could lead to further charges.</p>

Students also emphasized the importance of joining societies to meet like-minded people, especially for those who miss initial orientation events. The advice also covered practical matters like maintaining clean shared living spaces and, for commuting students, the necessity of planning travel carefully and being organized.</p>

The second accident occurred when an overloaded motorized boat, carrying mostly students, capsized at a river confluence, resulting in at least 86 deaths.

Robinson, who briefly attended Utah State University on a scholarship, was studying in an electrical apprenticeship program. According to Utah's governor, a family member told investigators Robinson had become "more political in recent years" and expressed a strong dislike for Kirk.

Investigators revealed that Robinson had expressed dislike for Kirk's views and had sent messages on Discord about retrieving a rifle from a "drop point." A bolt-action rifle with engraved casings, including one that read "hey fascist!

Critics and former EPA officials argue that ending the program would blind the public, policymakers, and businesses to crucial information about climate pollution.

          <p>The sequel to the iconic 1984 rock-mockumentary, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast but largely fails to replicate the satirical brilliance of its predecessor. The film sees the clueless band members—Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls—reuniting for one last concert, a concept that provides some smiles but lacks the original's sharp comedic tension. According to the article, the sequel feels more like a feature-length outtake reel, with gag encores and star cameos that fall flat. While the three leads can still generate moments of improvisational charm, the movie ultimately serves as a nostalgia lap that misses the clever humor that made the first film a classic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing company systematically discriminates against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims Uber drivers frequently refuse service to individuals with service animals, illegally charge cleaning fees for animal shedding, and fail to accommodate mobility devices. According to the Justice Department, these actions have caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be stranded. Uber responded that it prohibits such discrimination and takes action against drivers who violate its accessibility policies, though it stated it disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit. The government is seeking $125 million for affected individuals.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed Senate Bill 79, a significant housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and permit denser, taller residential buildings near public transit corridors. Introduced by State Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill aims to address the state's severe housing shortage by allowing for buildings up to nine stories high adjacent to major transit stops. The legislation, which now heads to the governor's desk, faced criticism from some local authorities but gained crucial support from construction trade unions after amendments were added to include union hiring provisions. Proponents hail it as a vital step toward creating more housing in well-connected communities.</p>

While Trump immediately blamed the "radical left," Cox emphasized that only the individual suspect was responsible and urged the public to reject rage-fueled politics. The governor lamented the state of political discourse, particularly the influence of social media, and called on people to "log off" and engage in constructive conversations. The piece portrays Cox as a rare voice of conciliation within the GOP, even as the dominant party impulse follows a more divisive path.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores why many conservatives immediately labeled Charlie Kirk a Christian martyr following his assassination, arguing it reflects a modern evangelicalism that has moved away from empathy. The author contrasts the traditional evangelical focus on love and service with Kirk's public rhetoric, which often belittled marginalized groups and dismissed empathy as a "made-up new-age term." The piece suggests that Kirk's followers see his right-wing political and religious convictions as the future of America, where their worldview is dominant.

The administration had referred the matter to the Department of Justice, but this document suggests the lender was aware of the property's intended use.

          <p>A major cyber attack has forced Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to shut down production worldwide for nearly two weeks, creating a severe crisis for its network of suppliers. The stoppage has already cost JLR an estimated £50 million, but the most significant impact is on smaller and medium-sized businesses in its supply chain, many of whom are now reportedly facing bankruptcy. With production lines idle, suppliers have begun laying off workers, and there are growing calls for the government to establish a furlough scheme to prevent widespread job losses.
