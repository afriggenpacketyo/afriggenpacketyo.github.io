          <p>The United States and China have resumed trade negotiations in Geneva, marking the first high-level discussions since the US imposed increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. These talks aim to address the ongoing trade war that has disrupted global supply chains and raised concerns about economic slowdown. Both sides are facing pressure to de-escalate tensions due to the impact of tariffs on their economies, with factory output in China declining and US industries facing supply chain disruptions. The negotiations are closely watched by economists and investors, who fear further escalation could lead to slower growth and higher prices worldwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. The order did not specify how the increase in staffing at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would be funded. Trump has called for individuals to self deport, using a government app known as CPB Home. This week, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced $1,000 (Â£751) bonuses and paid travel for people who leave the US voluntarily.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during a joint visit to Kyiv, urged Russia to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire, threatening new sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if it refuses. The European effort, coordinated with the White House, aims to de-escalate the conflict and pave the way for peace negotiations. While Ukraine agreed to the cease-fire, Russia dismissed the threat of new sanctions and insisted on the cessation of Western military aid as a precondition. The article details the European leaders' demands, Russia's response, and the broader geopolitical context of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home tool as an alternative to the traditional Pap smear. Developed by Teal Health, the Teal Wand allows women to collect a vaginal sample for HPV testing, which is then mailed to a lab. A U.S.-based study found that at-home screening was just as effective as in-office procedures and preferred by women. This new device aims to increase screening rates and reduce cervical cancer diagnoses by offering a more convenient and less painful experience.</p>
