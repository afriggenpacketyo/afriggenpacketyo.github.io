          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up over 2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 rising almost 3% to a new high, following a coalition government agreement. This market optimism occurred despite China's third-quarter GDP growing by 4.8%, which was in line with analyst expectations. Investors also noted China's decision to keep benchmark lending rates unchanged, contributing to a cautious but positive sentiment across the region. US markets had also closed higher the previous Friday, influenced by a softening tone in US-China trade talks.</p>

          <p>The British military will soon be granted new authority to shoot down drones that pose a threat to military bases, a measure aimed at enabling faster and more decisive action. Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce the introduction of this 'kinetic option,' allowing troops or Ministry of Defence police to neutralize dangerous drones. This development follows multiple drone incursions at British airbases used by US forces and widespread airspace disruptions across Europe. Existing protocols primarily involve diverting drones or disrupting their GPS signals, with lethal force reserved for extreme circumstances.</p>

          <p>Christian McCaffrey delivered an outstanding performance for the San Francisco 49ers, accumulating 201 yards from scrimmage and scoring two touchdowns, as the team defeated the Atlanta Falcons 20-10. McCaffrey's rushing prowess, with 129 yards on the ground, was complemented by his 72 receiving yards. The 49ers' defense also played a crucial role, limiting the Falcons' offense despite San Francisco's injury woes. This victory improved the 49ers' record to 5-2, while the Falcons dropped to 3-3 after a frustrating offensive night.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% in the third quarter year-on-year, aligning with analyst predictions despite a persistent real estate downturn. However, fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted by 0.5% in the first nine months, marking a 'rare and alarming' drop not seen since the 2020 pandemic, according to economists. While industrial production surpassed expectations, retail sales growth slowed, and headline inflation fell, indicating ongoing deflationary pressures. The central bank kept lending rates unchanged, and the overall economic picture suggests potential downward pressure on future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Following a dominant performance at the United States Grand Prix, where he secured pole position and victory in both the sprint and main race, Verstappen has closed the points gap to McLaren's Oscar Piastri to 40. His recent form, including a 64-point gain in four races, is attributed to car upgrades and a better understanding of the vehicle.

          <p>As the global secondhand luxury market expands at three times the rate of the firsthand market, authentication has become the paramount factor for credible resale platforms. With the market projected to reach $360 billion by 2030, sophisticated counterfeits, known as 'superfakes,' necessitate robust verification processes. Platforms like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in proprietary authentication systems, combining visual inspections, scientific equipment, and AI to ensure authenticity. This commitment to verification is boosting consumer trust and driving significant growth in the luxury resale segment, attracting younger shoppers seeking affordability and unique items.

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is investigating claims that Russian hackers stole hundreds of sensitive military documents and published them on the dark web. The files reportedly contain details of eight RAF and Royal Navy bases, including RAF Lakenheath, and MoD staff names and emails. The maintenance and construction contractor, Dodd Group, confirmed it suffered a ransomware incident and is taking the claims 'extremely seriously.' This incident follows a series of high-profile data breaches at the MoD, raising significant concerns about national security and data protection.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers' defense struggled significantly, allowing Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor to rush for three touchdowns in a 38-24 defeat. Despite wearing nostalgic uniforms, the Chargers' defensive performance was described as not being 'themselves' in recent games, according to All-Pro safety Derwin James Jr. Quarterback Justin Herbert threw three second-half touchdowns, but the team couldn't overcome a deep deficit and two first-half interceptions. This loss marks the Chargers' third in four games, putting pressure on coach Jim Harbaugh to address defensive issues before their upcoming short-week game.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service discovered a 'suspicious stand' in a tree line near an area of Palm Beach International Airport used by Air Force One when President Trump travels to Florida. The FBI Director confirmed the finding, and the Secret Service shared a photo of what appeared to be a hunting stand. Sources indicated the stand had been there for months and was not initially part of Secret Service sweeps due to construction, which had rerouted Trump's airport access. This discovery occurred shortly after construction ended and Air Force One resumed using that section of the airport.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's military forces struck another alleged drug-carrying vessel, killing three people, marking the seventh such attack since last month. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the strike targeted a boat linked to a Colombian guerrilla group, carrying substantial narcotics in international waters. The administration justifies these actions by declaring a 'non-international armed conflict' with drug cartels, citing the tens of thousands of American deaths from drug smuggling as an 'armed attack.'

          <p>A Tesla Cybertruck, with only 800 miles on it, experienced a shocking depreciation at auction, failing to recoup even 70% of its initial $102,000 asking price. The highest bid for the practically new Foundation Series Model was just $69,420, highlighting Tesla's struggles amidst a year of sales slumps, fluctuating stocks, and talent exodus. This significant drop in value, coupled with eight recalls for the vehicle within a year and a half, could deter potential buyers of eco-friendly vehicles.

More recently, the 2011-2015 plan's focus on 'strategic emerging industries' like EVs and solar panels established China as a leader in green technology and a near monopoly in rare earth supply chains.
