          <p>Daniel Park, indicted in connection with the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing that killed the bomber, Guy Edward Bartkus, has died in federal custody. Park was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles and later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Authorities allege Park assisted Bartkus by supplying chemicals and explosive materials, and he was arrested after being deported from Poland. The FBI has classified the bombing as an act of domestic terrorism, citing the suspects’ adherence to a radical ideology known as "pro-mortalism," which views human reproduction as morally wrong. The cause of Park's death is under review. </p>

          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to utilize the yuan, aiming to diminish reliance on the U.S. dollar as global confidence in the greenback wanes.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs chose not to testify in his sex trafficking trial, which is expected to conclude this week. Prosecutors rested their case after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days, alleging that Combs used his business empire to coerce women into sex. Combs' lawyers presented a brief case, suggesting the alleged victims consented to the sex parties, while prosecutors argued Combs used his influence to pressure women and then blackmailed them into silence. The defense rested its case after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal, and lawyers are set to work with the judge on jury instructions before deliberations begin. </p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's nuclear program by months. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the underground infrastructure remained largely intact. The assessment provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the facilities, ranging from a few months to less than a year. The White House has disputed the findings, calling the assessment "flat-out wrong." </p>

          <p>A review on the use of thimerosal in vaccines, slated to be presented to the CDC, cites a study that does not exist, according to the scientist listed as the study’s author. The report references a study co-authored by UC Davis professor emeritus Robert Berman, but Berman stated that the citation is inaccurate and misrepresents his research. The meeting has become controversial after the US health secretary abruptly fired all previous expert panel members and named new members, some of whom have advocated against vaccines. Senators have called for the meeting to be postponed. </p>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have averted an estimated 154 million deaths over the past 50 years, however, efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. The COVID pandemic was a major hurdle for vaccination efforts, and health care professionals were diverted from vaccination efforts. The researchers estimate that the number of kids in India who got their first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine in 2023 was 93%, which is near levels in some high-income countries. The number of children born each year is expected to shrink by about 1.6% between now and 2030, but that matters for vaccination efforts. </p>

          <p>A British aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, has docked in Singapore on a rare Pacific deployment, signaling the UK's commitment to the region. The deployment includes stops in Australia, Japan, and Korea, and participation in multinational exercises. The group is headed down under next month to participate in an Australia-led exercise which will involve the US and other regional militaries. The deployment also comes at a time when Washington has become more unpredictable, which introduces uncertainty to military alliances in the region. </p>
