          <p>Tensions have escalated between China and the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea following a confrontation near Sandy Cay. The Chinese coastguard deployed water cannon against two Philippine vessels, claiming they illegally intruded into waters near Subi Reef and Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. According to the Chinese coastguard, the Philippine vessels landed personnel on Sandy Cay and approached a Chinese ship dangerously, leading to a collision. China has urged the Philippines to cease its actions, asserting its right to protect its jurisdiction in the area.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This reduction translates to a ¬£129 annual saving for a typical household, bringing the annual bill down to ¬£1,720. While this offers some relief, charities emphasize that many people are still struggling with energy costs, owing approximately ¬£4 billion to suppliers. The price cap does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.</p>

          <p>Chiquita announced it would lay off thousands of workers in Panama following what it called an "unjustified abandonment of work" since the end of April. The walkout, which began on April 28, has reportedly caused $75 million in losses and irreversible damage to banana production. Around 4,900 non-permanent workers out of Chiquita's approximately 7,000 employees in Panama are affected by the layoffs. The strike is part of a broader protest movement against proposed reforms to the social security system in Panama, with workers from various sectors joining the demonstrations.</p>

The Treasury says pennies are greatly underutilized, and there are approximately 114 billion pennies currently in circulation. Jay Zagorsky, professor of markets, public policy, and law at Boston University, supports the move but warns that US Congress must legislate that prices be rounded up in order to eliminate demand for the coin.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration decision to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could severely impact the university's sports teams. Many of Harvard's varsity sports teams rely heavily on international athletes, with some teams potentially losing a significant portion of their rosters. The Department of Homeland Security claims the school has created an unsafe campus environment for Jewish students. Harvard has called the action unlawful and is working to provide guidance to affected students.</p>

          <p>Liverpool head coach Arne Slot stated that excuses are for teams that don't win the league, expressing pride in his side's Premier League title victory despite challenges. Reflecting on leading the club to its 20th top-flight title in his first year succeeding Jurgen Klopp, Slot highlighted the team's success without significant squad strengthening. He drew comparisons to his time at Feyenoord, where he also won the league despite team overhauls. Slot's remarks contrasted with comments from other managers attributing their teams' shortcomings to injuries and other factors.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to explore holding a face-to-face meeting in June on the fringes of the Group of Seven summit in Canada. Both leaders expressed hope that a preceding round of ministerial-level tariff negotiations will be "productive." Ishiba emphasized the need for more bilateral cooperation, including in economic security. Japan has been urging the United States to rethink its tariff policy, including a 25 percent import duty on cars, due to concerns about its impact on the export-driven Japanese economy.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the growing use of the term "DEI hire" as a derogatory label, particularly in American politics, and its implications for equality and inclusion. It highlights instances where individuals from non-traditional backgrounds, especially women and people of color, are targeted with accusations of being unqualified and unfairly hired due to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The piece argues that this trend feeds into age-old grievances and creates a climate where prejudice can resurface, potentially undermining the progress made towards a more equitable society. It also touches on the challenges faced by individuals who experience "impostor syndrome" and the impact of social media abuse on public figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office has sparked controversy, with Trump focusing on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. The meeting, intended to address bilateral issues, was hijacked by Trump's false claims and misleading presentation of events. This has ignited anger and humor among Black South Africans, who feel the Trump administration is prioritizing the concerns of white Afrikaners over the historical injustices and ongoing inequality they face. Trump's actions are seen as damaging to American diplomacy and reflective of his focus on scoring points with his base rather than engaging in meaningful negotiations.</p>
