          <p>India announced it conducted military strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed last month. The Indian Ministry of Defence emphasized the strikes were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, targeting nine sites without hitting Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war, and Pakistani state media reported that three Indian Air Force fighter jets were shot down, while India stated that only terror camps were targeted. The U.S. Secretary of State is monitoring the situation and urging both sides toward a peaceful resolution, as most airlines are diverting out of Pakistani airspace.</p>

          <p>Five Mexican nationals face charges after a boat carrying migrants capsized off San Diego, resulting in three deaths, including a 14-year-old boy from India, with others missing and presumed dead. The U.S. Attorney's Office is prosecuting the suspects for Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Bringing in Aliens for Financial Gain. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty for the suspects. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that similar vessels are commonly used by smugglers, as human traffickers exploit migrants in deadly ventures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia during his trip to Saudi Arabia next week. This move aligns with the preferences of Arab nations, who have advocated for this change, while Iran maintains its historical ties to the name Persian Gulf. While the U.S. military has already been using the term Arabian Gulf in its communications, this formal change by the President could be seen as a symbolic gesture of support towards Gulf countries. The International Hydrographic Organization works to standardize the names of bodies of water, but countries often use different names in their own documentation.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Nashville, Freddie O'Connell, voiced concerns over recent ICE operations in the city that led to the arrests of a convicted child sexual predator and an alleged gang member, arguing that these actions do not enhance community safety. O'Connell emphasized that the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department was not involved in the enforcement and lacks federal immigration authority. DHS responded by stating that the mayor should want these criminal illegal aliens off American streets and denouncing attacks on law enforcement. ICE reported a significant increase in assaults on its officers and highlighted the agency's efforts in arresting and removing illegal immigrants, including gang members, during President Trumpâ€™s second term.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to transport a group of immigrants to Libya on a U.S. military plane, marking an escalation in its deportation program, according to U.S. officials. This decision has raised concerns due to the conflict and human rights issues in Libya, where migrant detention centers have been described as "horrific." The State Department advises against traveling to Libya due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict. This action follows previous controversial deportations of Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they are being held in a maximum-security prison.</p>

The People's Bank of China will reduce the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, releasing approximately $138.6 billion into the market. These measures were announced shortly after confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to discuss trade matters in Switzerland. This meeting represents the first confirmed trade talks since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Top Trump administration officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, will meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss trade and economic issues. This marks a potentially key moment amid escalating tariff tensions between the U.S. and China, with President Trump imposing 145% tariffs on many Chinese goods and China retaliating with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. Bessent indicated that initial discussions would likely focus on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, acknowledging that the high tariffs are unsustainable. The meetings aim to address the trade war that has caused stock market turbulence and fears of slower economic growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone during a meeting with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, a stark contrast to his previous rhetoric about acquiring Canada. Despite earlier posts criticizing Canada, Trump expressed his love for the country and emphasized the importance of friendship. Carney, however, firmly asserted Canada's independence and rejected any notion of becoming the 51st state. Trump touched on various unrelated topics, including Barack Obamaâ€™s presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen, while Carney remained guarded and focused on maintaining Canada's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to tariffs implemented by President Trump, which have increased import duties and tariffs to a combined 181.47%. The company, which imports about 90% of its bikes from China, paid $3.1 million in tariffs during a one-month period, leading to the cancellation of new orders from China. The company says fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially viable, making it difficult to compete.</p>

          <p>A plant in Shanxi, China, is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminium from Chinaâ€™s low-grade ore that was previously unusable. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement the technology.</p>

Despite the disagreement, Trump insisted that the rejection would not hinder trade negotiations and congratulated Carney on his recent election victory. Carney also mentioned asking Trump to stop referring to Canada as the 51st state, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's team lobbied officials in West Lake Hills, Texas, to keep details about his mansion and security operations private, citing his work with the Trump administration. The request came amid a dispute with neighbors over the construction of a 16-foot fence and gate without proper permits. Musk's team argued that as a "federal public official," his property records should be exempt from public records laws. However, the city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk ultimately lost his appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property.</p>
