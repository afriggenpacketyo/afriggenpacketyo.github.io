          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a judge ruled her detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa following an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's actions in the war with Hamas. The judge emphasized that there was no evidence of violence or advocacy for violence by Ozturk, and the university expressed support for her return to campus. The case raises concerns about the targeting of international students for expressing political views. This case highlights the importance of protecting free speech, especially in academic settings.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated as Pakistan reported that India fired missiles at its air bases, prompting retaliatory strikes.

The U.S. Secretary of State has urged both parties to de-escalate and offered assistance for constructive talks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at 20 federal agencies. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from federal employee unions, who argued that the administration's cost-cutting drive exceeded its legal authority. The judge agreed, stating that President Trump likely needs Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks. The order prevents agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. This decision provides temporary relief for federal employees and underscores the importance of legal checks on executive power.</p>

          <p>Police in Bristol are focusing on policing the men who buy sexual services from street sex workers, aiming to combat exploitation and harm. Dedicated teams engage with the sex workers while disrupting the men, following the Nordic Model approach, which criminalizes the buyers rather than the often-vulnerable women. The Op Boss team conducts surveillance and sends men on courses to prevent reoffending, while the Night Light team collaborates with charities to offer support to the street workers. This approach seeks to safeguard the women, gather intelligence, and break down barriers between sex workers and law enforcement, with other police forces hoping to replicate the project's success.</p>

SB17 includes exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, focusing on actions and affiliations rather than nationality. Proponents emphasize that the bill is about protecting Texans from foreign espionage and influence, not about discrimination.

The Georgia seat is crucial for both parties' Senate ambitions, with Republicans aiming to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. Greene's polling numbers against Ossoff lagged behind Kemp's, influencing her decision. Kemp is still considering his future in the party and may have higher aspirations.</p>

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller argued that the United States is facing a national security threat due to undocumented migrants.

The move would curtail a constitutional right to due process and is seen as a dramatic escalation of the administration's immigration policy.

The spacecraft was designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, so it may survive re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.
