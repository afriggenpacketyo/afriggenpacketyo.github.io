          <h2>Trump's Approval Rating Dips After 100 Days in Second Term</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 11:31:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Fox News poll indicates that President Trump's approval rating stands at 44% with 55% disapproval as he approaches 100 days into his second term, reflecting growing concerns over the economy, inflation, and the recent trade war. The poll highlights a significant partisan divide, with nearly 90% of Republicans approving and a similar percentage of Democrats disapproving of Trump's performance. Despite the dip, Trump's approval is similar to his first term, but lower than predecessors like Kennedy and Eisenhower. The president's economic policies, particularly tariffs, are contributing to market instability and impacting his approval. Optimism around the current administration is not particularly high given the trade tensions and approval rating.</p>

          <h2>HR Expert Warns Against Frequent Job Changes on Resumes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 11:30:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Angela Beatty, HR officer at Accenture, advises job seekers to avoid a pattern of short employment stints (one year or less) on their resumes, as it raises concerns about their ability to gain traction and collaborate effectively. A LinkedIn survey supports this, with 37% of hiring managers citing frequent job changes as a potential deterrent. Beatty suggests that if a resume reflects shorter-term roles, it's important to articulate whether those roles were specifically designed to be shorter term, or if there were other factors outside of the job-seeker's control that affected the tenure.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian study analyzing data from eight countries has found a direct correlation between high consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased rates of premature death. Countries with stronger food cultures and lower UPF intake, like Japan and Mediterranean nations, exhibit lower premature mortality rates. The study suggests focusing on overall dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients, advocating for food system improvements such as sugar taxes and incentives for farmers to diversify production. The US is starting to move away from artificial additives, but the shift is currently voluntary.</p>

          <p>U.S. agriculture exporters are reporting significant financial losses due to the global backlash against President Trump's tariffs, particularly a decline in Chinese buying of U.S. farm products.

The Port of Oakland warns that a tariff-induced downturn could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health.

          <p>Experts predict that gold prices may continue to rise, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce in 2025, driven by economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable market performance.

While hitting the $4,000 mark may be challenging, analysts suggest that continued economic instability and market sell-offs could propel gold prices further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Settling a debt, which involves paying less than the original amount owed, can negatively impact your credit score in the short term, as it's typically viewed less favorably than paying the full balance. However, in the long run, settling a debt can improve financial stability and allow for better management of other obligations, ultimately aiding credit score recovery. Alternative debt relief options that may improve credit scores include debt management plans and debt consolidation. It is important to choose the right type of relief to achieve the financial goals for the individual.</p>

Factors such as Nottingham Forest having a remarkable season, Crystal Palace being based in London and Aston Villa's buoyant team chasing silverware under Unai Emery can be taken into consideration for those numbers.</p>

His speech contrasted with other potential rivals who have advocated for bipartisan collaboration. He saved his sharpest attacks for Trump’s cabinet, describing the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, as “a weird nepo baby who once stashed a dead bear in the back seat of his car” and the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, as “a washed-up Fox TV commentator”.</p>
