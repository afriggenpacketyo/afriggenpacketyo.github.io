President Trump deployed National Guard troops to address the situation, a move criticized by California's Governor Newsom as inflammatory. The protests caused traffic disruptions, including a shutdown of the 101 freeway, and resulted in multiple arrests.

          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are voting on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, with a potential strike looming if the deal is rejected. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the offer as inadequate, citing over a decade of pay erosion and high numbers of nurses quitting. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action over pay. The outcome of the vote could impact the government's upcoming 10-year plan for the NHS in England. </p>

          <h2>UK Energy System Faces Radical Shake-Up to Lower Bills</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering a radical overhaul of the electricity market, moving from a national system to regional markets to lower energy bills. The current system compensates energy firms for not providing power when the grid is overloaded, costing the country hundreds of millions. The proposed "zonal" pricing system aims to incentivize renewable energy production in regions with abundant resources like Scotland. The plan has sparked debate among energy firms, with some fearing it could undermine contracts and increase uncertainty.</p>

          <p>NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to maintain a safe and reliable supply in England. The number of regular donors needs to increase to over one million to avoid a "red alert" situation. There is a particular need for donors with O negative blood and more black donors to help treat sickle cell disease. The appeal comes after the NHS issued an amber alert last year due to low blood stocks.</p>

          <p>During the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government quietly considered reimagining India as a centralized state with a presidential system. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, the proposal aimed to concentrate executive power and sideline the judiciary. While the idea never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. The story highlights a period of authoritarian tendencies and a debate over the balance of power in India's democracy.</p>
