          <p>The Maryland residence of John Bolton, former national security advisor under President Donald Trump, was raided by the FBI as part of a national security investigation concerning classified records. This action follows a history of legal conflict between Bolton and the Trump administration, including a 2020 Justice Department lawsuit that unsuccessfully attempted to block the publication of his critical memoir. The raid was authorized by a court, and officials have stated there is no threat to public safety, though the investigation into potential public corruption continues.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Home Office is appealing a High Court decision that granted a local council an injunction to stop the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping for housing asylum seekers. The legal action from the council came after significant community tensions and protests arose following an incident where an asylum seeker was charged with sexually assaulting a teenager. The government's move to appeal highlights the broader challenge it faces in managing asylum accommodations, as a ruling against it could empower other councils to take similar legal action.</p>

          <p>A report of an active shooter at Villanova University triggered a campus-wide lockdown and a massive law enforcement response, but was later confirmed by officials to be a "cruel hoax." The false alarm caused widespread panic among students and families who were on campus for orientation day activities. This incident, potentially a case of "swatting," occurred shortly after a similar false threat at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, prompting investigations and calls from officials to hold the perpetrators accountable.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has implemented a new rule requiring disaster victims to have an email address to apply for federal assistance, raising concerns among current and former officials.

          <h2>Study Finds Cash Grants in Kenya Dramatically Reduced Child Mortality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 07:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A randomized controlled trial conducted by the charity GiveDirectly in rural Kenya found that providing one-time cash grants of approximately $1,871 to impoverished households led to a 48% reduction in infant and child mortality. The study suggests the cash improved outcomes by enabling better nutrition, more hospital-based births, and allowing mothers to reduce work hours around childbirth. However, the article notes an important caveat: while effective, the program was significantly less cost-effective at saving lives than targeted health interventions like vitamin supplementation or malaria prevention.</p>

          <p>A recently emerged, unverified photograph appears to show a new large, flying-wing stealth drone undergoing flight testing in China. The aircraft's design, which combines the wings and fuselage into a single flat shape, bears a resemblance to the Rainbow CH-7, a stealth reconnaissance drone being developed by a state-owned aerospace corporation. The sighting aligns with expectations that the CH-7 would conduct its maiden flight this year, indicating progress in China's advanced unmanned military aircraft programs.</p>

          <p>An in-depth report highlights the growing dangers and complexities of receiving maternity care in U.S. states that have enacted restrictive abortion bans since the Dobbs decision. The article details instances where doctors, fearing prosecution, have delayed or hesitated to provide medically necessary emergency care for pregnancy complications, leading to worse health outcomes for patients. Data suggests higher rates of maternal mortality and complications like sepsis in these states, as the laws create a climate of legal uncertainty that can compromise the standard of care.</p>

          <p>This article examines Donald Trump's hands-on economic policies, such as imposing tariffs and pressuring companies on pricing, through an interview with Bhaskar Sunkara, a prominent socialist voice. Sunkara argues that while state intervention in the economy is a legitimate tool, Trump's approach lacks a coherent, long-term strategy and appears to be more about ad hoc favoritism than a plan to benefit the working class. He characterizes Trump's actions as a chaotic form of "state capitalism" that is ultimately detrimental to any progressive or socialist vision for society.</p>

          <p>A legislative proposal to allow more individuals to become "accredited investors" by passing a knowledge test, rather than solely meeting income or net worth thresholds, is gaining traction. This would open up high-risk, high-reward private market investments to a broader audience. However, experts caution that designing a test that can effectively assess an investor's understanding of the unique risks associated with private assets—such as illiquidity and subjective valuation—and truly protect them from substantial losses is an incredibly difficult task.

Dame Ellen expressed that she was honored by the gesture, which links her name to a creature that lived 125 million years ago.</p>
