          <p>Migratory birds are vital for maintaining ecosystem health through pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control, also serving as bioindicators of environmental quality. However, rising global temperatures and extreme weather events are disrupting their journeys. Changes in coastal stopover locations due to rising sea levels, reduced food availability from ocean acidification, and conflicts with resident animals due to altered migration routes threaten bird populations. The article emphasizes the need for expanded protected areas and the creation of bird-friendly habitats to mitigate human impact and preserve these crucial species, ensuring the health of both ecosystems and human food security.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies have proposed a 30-day unconditional ceasefire with Russia, set to begin on Monday, contingent on Russia's agreement and effective monitoring. The European Union supports the proposal, emphasizing that it must be implemented without preconditions to pave the way for meaningful peace negotiations. The UK, France, and Germany, backed by the U.S., are demanding that Vladimir Putin accept the ceasefire, threatening increased sanctions and military support for Ukraine if he refuses. This initiative follows previous attempts at brokering a deal, with the U.S. expressing frustration over past failures to achieve a lasting resolution.</p>

          <p>Multiple explosions were reported in India-administered Kashmir shortly after India and Pakistan agreed to a U.S.-mediated ceasefire deal. Residents reported blackouts following the blasts, and cross-border shelling was reported along the Line of Control. The truce, announced by U.S. President Trump, followed weeks of clashes triggered by a massacre on tourists, which India blamed on Pakistan, though Pakistan rejected the accusation. While some Pakistanis expressed relief, an Indian government source claimed Pakistan violated the ceasefire agreement, raising concerns about the stability of the deal.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in state prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, posing as a friend and tax preparer, gained access to the victim's financial information and offered fraudulent investment opportunities promising high returns with no risk. She ran a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and funding a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute when the scheme collapsed, leading to Cohen-Roth's conviction on 23 felony counts of financial fraud.</p>

Many individuals are finding success with these medications, which suppress appetite and provide a sense of control over food.

While the company emphasizes its holistic approach and scientific backing, some experts caution against relying solely on medication, advocating for a focus on the psychological reasons behind overeating.

          <p>Heathrow Airport's Terminal 1, once a pivotal hub for short-haul flights, has faded from view a decade after its closure in 2015. Opened in 1968, it was surpassed by newer terminals and ultimately rendered obsolete by the modernization of Terminal 2. Today, Terminal 1 serves as a baggage handling facility and a training center for emergency services. Despite its disappearance from the route map, the building continues to play a role in the airport's operations, a silent reminder of its past glory.</p>

          <p>Smokey Robinson performed at the Beau Rivage Theater, making no mention of the sexual assault allegations levied against him this week. The 85-year-old Motown star, celebrating the 50th anniversary of his album “A Quiet Storm,” proceeded with the concert despite a lawsuit filed by four former housekeepers alleging years of sexual assault. While his lawyer denies the claims, Robinson smiled widely and danced suggestively, and the audience responded with enthusiasm and support. Many attendees expressed that the lawsuit did not affect their enjoyment of the performance, focusing instead on his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered military leaders to review and remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and "gender ideology" from their libraries. Leaders must identify materials that promote "divisive concepts" incompatible with the department's mission by May 21. This follows a similar order to military academies, including the removal of nearly 400 books from the U.S. Naval Academy. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to purge DEI from the Pentagon, aligning with the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate DEI roles within the federal government.</p>

          <p>Personal finance expert Ric Edelman warns that America is failing to adequately educate its youngest investors, leading to a reliance on get-rich-quick schemes and overly complex financial products. He stresses the importance of financial literacy, especially given longer lifespans and the need for long-term financial security. Edelman cautions against getting financial advice from unreliable sources like TikTok and advocates for mandatory personal finance courses in high schools. While young investors face challenges like limited capital, Edelman remains optimistic about their motivation to achieve financial success.</p>

          <p>A creative writing teacher reflects on the impact of her now-defunct prison classroom for incarcerated women, which provided a space for healing and self-discovery. The program was cut after the federal government revoked funding from Maine's Department of Corrections due to the state housing a transgender woman in a women's facility. The decision resulted in the loss of vital programs, including substance use treatment and re-entry support, impacting vulnerable individuals. The author emphasizes the importance of rehabilitation and dignity within the prison system, advocating for policies that support incarcerated women's well-being.</p>
