          <h2>UK Trade Secretary Optimistic About Overturning Trump Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-01 06:48:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds expressed confidence in the UK's ability to overturn US tariffs imposed by President Trump, despite the lack of immediate exemption.  Ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration position the UK favorably for eventual tariff reversal.  However, economists warn that significant tariffs could negatively impact the UK economy and government borrowing targets.  The deal under negotiation aims to address broader economic issues beyond tariffs, including technology, goods, services, and agriculture.</p>

          <p>ICE acknowledged an administrative error in the deportation of Kilmer Armado Abrego-Garcia, a Maryland man with protected legal status, to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison.  Abrego-Garcia, who has a US citizen wife and child, was deported due to a mistaken belief of gang affiliation.  The US government maintains that Abrego-Garcia had a fair opportunity to present evidence disputing these claims, while his attorneys argue that the government lacks evidence.  The court's jurisdiction is limited, preventing a direct order for his return.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump's tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are expected to increase prices for consumers.  While intended to boost domestic manufacturing, the broad scope and high rates of the tariffs could backfire.  Economists predict significant increases in car prices and a reduction in household disposable income.  The potential benefits of tariffs, such as revenue generation and industry protection, are outweighed by the negative consequences for consumers and manufacturers.<br><i>* (not investment advice)</i></p>

          <p>A seven-figure settlement has been reached in over 20 legal claims of historical sexual abuse at Celtic Boys Club.  Around 30 former players initiated a class action against Celtic Plc for damages, with 70% of cases settled.  The settlement follows the convictions of several former coaches and officials for sexual offenses against teenage players.
