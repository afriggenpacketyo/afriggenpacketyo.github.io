          <p>During a traffic stop in Springfield Township, Ohio, police discovered a pet raccoon named Chewy in the front seat of a car with a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth. The officers initially pulled over Victoria Vidal, 55, due to an active warrant and a suspended driver's license. A subsequent search of the vehicle revealed a large amount of methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Chewy was unharmed and taken into protective custody, while Vidal faces multiple drug possession charges. Police noted the incident was an unexpected turn of events.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to California Governor Gavin Newsom's request for a federal film tax credit aimed at revitalizing the American film industry, which Trump described as 'decimated' by other countries and Newsom's policies. Newsom's proposal followed Trump's announcement of potential 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S. Trump criticized Newsom's handling of the state's high-speed rail project and wildfires, but also expressed a liking for Newsom. The president vowed to meet with film industry executives to ensure their satisfaction with the prospective tariffs.</p>

He also condemned Trump's comments about acquiring Greenland and annexing Canada, stating that such behavior is not representative of American values.

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor, argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed understanding of economics. While Miran suggests the dollar's reserve currency status hurts American manufacturing, Rogoff points out that the US ran current account surpluses when the dollar was already a reserve currency. Rogoff contends that the current account deficit is influenced by factors beyond the exchange rate, including the fiscal deficit and the strength of the American economy. Rogoff concludes that addressing the fiscal deficit would be a more effective solution than initiating a trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

The official message suggests that the war in Ukraine is a continuation of World War II, with Russia defending itself against external aggression.

Poland is increasing its military spending, taking a more prominent role in the European Union, and organizing citizen civil defense training. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has advocated for Europe to develop its own nuclear arsenal, reflecting concerns about the reliability of American security guarantees. Poland's location on NATOâ€™s eastern edge makes it a crucial buffer against Russian encroachment, heightening its vulnerability and security concerns.</p>

          <p>Despite the war with Russia, Ukraine's economy has shown impressive resilience, underpinned by effective military resistance and strengthened state capacity. However, this resilience relies heavily on external financial support, creating a dependency on foreign assistance. While Russia's economy is often seen as successful, it is fundamentally dependent on fossil fuels, facing challenges with falling oil demand and dwindling liquid assets. A recent minerals agreement with the United States, though improved from earlier versions, highlights Ukraine's dependency and raises concerns about unequal terms.</p>

          <p>India launched strikes against Pakistan, following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, escalating a decades-long conflict over the region. The conflict's roots trace back to the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, with Kashmir's fate left undecided, leading to wars in 1947, 1965, and 1999. Despite attempts at peace, tensions have persisted, marked by insurgency, political turmoil, and military confrontations. The region remains heavily militarized, with the recent attack and subsequent strikes highlighting the ongoing volatility and unresolved dispute.</p>

          <p>Five Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been sheltering at the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas for over a year, have left the country and are now in the United States. The move comes as Venezuela attempts to appease the Trump administration amid threats to reimpose oil sanctions. These activists, top aides to opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado, ran a consequential presidential campaign from the residence, helping to organize voter turnout and collect evidence of election fraud. The escape occurred weeks before regional elections, as Maduro attempts to project a democratic image.</p>

The U.S. bombing campaign against the Houthis has cost over $1 billion, and some military strategists are concerned about its impact on readiness for potential conflicts with China.
