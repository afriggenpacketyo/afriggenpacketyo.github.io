          <p>Ruth Posner, a 96-year-old Holocaust survivor, and her husband Michael, 97, have died together at an assisted dying clinic in Switzerland. The couple, who were married for nearly 75 years, informed friends and family via email that their decision was mutual and stemmed from a declining quality of life due to failing health. Posner, who escaped a Nazi ghetto as a child, became a successful actress and dancer and dedicated her later years to educating young people about the Holocaust. Friends and memorial trusts paid tribute to the couple's vibrant lives and endorsed their final decision.</p>

          <p>The New York City medical examiner has found that Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people in Midtown Manhattan in July before taking his own life, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). In a note found at the scene, Tamura, a former high school football player, had requested his brain be studied for the degenerative disease, which he blamed for his troubles. While experts caution that a CTE diagnosis does not fully explain such violent behavior, the finding adds a significant element to the investigation into the tragic event. The NFL, which was Tamura's apparent target, expressed its condolences.</p>

Bertinelli has also been outspoken about the emotional abuse she endured in her second marriage to Tom Vitale, from whom she split in 2022.

          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its 38 ABC-affiliated stations, ending a preemption of the late-night show. The broadcaster had stopped showing the program after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks related to the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ABC had reinstated the show after a six-day suspension, but major affiliate owners like Sinclair and Nexstar had continued to block it. Sinclair stated its decision was based on ensuring its programming serves the interests of its communities while honoring network obligations.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Opening a Certificate of Deposit in Early October</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve having recently cut interest rates, savers are facing diminishing returns, but opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October could still be a strategic move. Financial experts point to three key reasons: locking in a fixed rate allows interest to begin compounding immediately, it secures a return before an anticipated rate cut at the end of the month, and it preempts banks that might lower their CD rates in advance of the Fed's decision. Proactively securing a CD now can help maximize savings in a declining rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Howard Rubin, a once-prominent Wall Street bond trader, and his former assistant have been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts. The indictment alleges that from 2009 to 2019, Rubin brutalized women in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse, causing injuries that sometimes required medical attention. Prosecutors claim the duo spent at least $1 million operating the trafficking network and used non-disclosure agreements to threaten victims. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking and ordered to pay millions in damages.</p>

The fallout included Comey's explosive congressional testimony, a tell-all memoir critical of Trump, and years of public attacks from the former president.

This move signals a potential softening of the party's stance on the controversial policy, which is facing increasing pressure for abolition from within Labour and from outside figures.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card delinquencies rise, it is crucial for consumers to understand the timeline of consequences for late payments. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers will not report it to credit bureaus until it is 30 days past due, which is the first major threshold for credit score damage. At 60 days late, card companies may impose a high penalty APR, and by 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts can begin. Proactive communication with lenders before missing a payment is the most effective way to mitigate financial harm.</p>

          <p>This article presents the argument that accusing critics of hypocrisy is a flawed and evasive tactic used to defend attacks on free speech. The author contends that this approach, employed by both the political right and left, deliberately ignores principled arguments for liberal norms in order to justify abandoning them. Instead of engaging with the idea of free speech itself, the tactic shifts the debate to who is repressing whom, which ultimately undermines the core values of open debate. The piece concludes that focusing on hypocrisy relieves people from defending their own principles.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a new home equity loan has slightly decreased. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term and $1,452 for a 15-year term. These figures represent a modest saving of about $16 per month compared to rates from earlier in the year. While not a dramatic drop, the potential for further rate cuts later this year may make home equity borrowing an increasingly attractive option for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of federal student loan borrowers waiting for their applications to be processed for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program has swelled to 74,510. This program allows public service workers to make retroactive payments for past periods of forbearance or deferment to qualify for debt cancellation sooner. The backlog has grown under the Trump administration, which terminated nearly half of the Education Department's staff earlier this year. Despite the significant delays, consumer advocates still encourage eligible borrowers to apply while also exploring other repayment options.</p>

          <p>A heartwarming moment at a Seattle Mariners game has gone viral after a fan who caught a historic baseball immediately gifted it to a young boy. Glenn Mutti-Driscoll caught Cal Raleigh's 60th home run ball, a potentially valuable piece of memorabilia, and without hesitation handed it to 12-year-old Marcus Rueblos. The boy, in turn, decided the ball should go to Raleigh, trading it for a signed bat. The Mariners later located Mutti-Driscoll and rewarded his act of generosity with a signed bat of his own, celebrating a chain of feel-good events.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has seized more than $220 million worth of cocaine in a series of recent drug interceptions in the Pacific Ocean. Crews from the cutters Midgett and Diligence stopped multiple smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico, Central, and South America, confiscating a combined total of nearly 30,000 pounds of narcotics. The agency released photos of the seized drugs being offloaded and of one of the smuggling boats on fire. The Coast Guard states that such vessels are often sunk after narcotics are removed to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards.</p>

The biennial tournament, which pits the U.S. against Europe, is known for its loud, partisan crowds that stand in stark contrast to the usual quiet etiquette of golf. The author suggests that the New York audience, known for its passionate and sometimes confrontational nature, will create an especially challenging environment for the visiting European team, turning the crowd itself into a formidable opponent.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional retirement withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and unexpected costs. The strategy aims to provide a balance of financial security and flexibility, reducing stress during volatile markets by ensuring a stable base income. (not investment advice)</p>

The 17-page agreement sharply limits news-gathering activities, requiring prior approval for the release of even unclassified information and banning reporters from many areas of the building without an escort. The author, a veteran Pentagon correspondent, contends that these restrictions break with decades of precedent under both parties and will ultimately harm the American public by reducing transparency about the nation's military.
