          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has ordered Ticketmaster to improve its pricing transparency following an investigation prompted by complaints about Oasis reunion tour tickets. The company must now provide 24-hour notice for tiered pricing systems and offer more detailed price information in online queues. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing," Ticketmaster must ensure its ticket labels are accurate and will report to the CMA for the next two years to ensure compliance. This action aims to give fans clearer, upfront information about the true cost of tickets.</p>

          <p>An NPR analysis reveals that the Paramount Schools of Excellence charter network in Indiana suspends students with disabilities at three times the state average. While proponents praise the schools for creating calm classrooms and achieving strong academic results, some parents argue the rigid rules unfairly punish students with conditions like ADHD. One mother shared how her son's frequent suspensions for behavior linked to his disability have caused him to fall behind academically. This situation highlights a national debate over whether strict disciplinary measures protect the learning environment or penalize students who cannot conform.</p>

          <p>Amid rising fatalities, transportation safety experts are emphasizing "defensive walking and cycling" to prevent accidents. Key recommendations include looking in all directions before crossing, ensuring visibility especially at night, and using designated sidewalks and bike paths whenever possible. Pedestrians and cyclists are also advised to avoid distractions like headphones or phones, be aware of faster e-scooters, and use proper hand signals when biking. The guidance stresses that while drivers have a responsibility, individuals must also take ownership of their safety on the road.</p>

          <p>A Paris court has found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of criminal conspiracy related to illicit campaign financing from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He was acquitted of other charges, including passive corruption. The prosecution alleged that Sarkozy used millions from Gaddafi to fund his successful 2007 presidential campaign, a claim that emerged after the investigation began in 2013. This conviction is the latest in a series of legal troubles for Sarkozy, who has faced multiple corruption cases since leaving office in 2012.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office has left one detainee dead and two others critically wounded, prompting the agency to place all its facilities on higher alert. The suspected shooter, who was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on a nearby rooftop, reportedly fired indiscriminately at the building. Law enforcement is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, citing anti-ICE messages found on ammunition near the suspect. The attack has drawn condemnation from political leaders, who have called for an end to politically motivated violence.</p>

          <p>Beijing has placed three American companies on its "Unreliable Entity List" for their involvement in arms sales to Taiwan, effectively banning them from trade and investment in China. The sanctioned firms are Saronic Technologies, Aerkomm, and Oceaneering International. Additionally, China has added three other U.S. firms—Huntingon Ingalls Industries, Planate, and Global Dimensions—to an export control list, restricting their ability to receive Chinese products that have both civilian and military applications. This move represents an escalation in trade tensions between the two nations over the issue of Taiwanese sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has publicly confirmed that Labour MPs contacted him over the summer about potentially challenging Sir Keir Starmer for the party's leadership. In recent interviews, Burnham has outlined a distinct policy platform, including higher taxes on expensive homes and increased borrowing for public investment, directly challenging the current government's fiscal caution. While a path back to Westminster is complicated, his provocative statements and alternative economic vision are seen as a significant challenge to Starmer's authority ahead of the Labour party conference, signaling growing dissent within the party.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the Democratic party is missing a political opportunity by allowing figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to become its most prominent voices. The author argues that their progressive and democratic socialist platforms are out of step with mainstream American voters. The article suggests that focusing on certain social issues alienates moderate voters and that the Republican party would benefit from running against these individuals as the face of a "hyper-liberal" Democratic party. The piece also criticizes Kamala Harris's post-election activities.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch, once struggling after a move to Bayern Munich, has flourished under manager Arne Slot to become one of Europe's premier midfielders. After a quiet first season, Slot repurposed him as a holding midfielder, where he has excelled, adding more attacking freedom to his game this season. His performance has been pivotal to Liverpool's strong start to the season, with his defensive work complemented by an increased offensive output, including his first league goals for the club. This resurgence has re-established him as a key player for both Liverpool and the Dutch national team.</p>

          <p>The BBC, along with Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press, and Reuters, has launched a film calling for Israel to permit foreign journalists independent access to the Gaza Strip. For nearly two years since the conflict began, international reporters have been barred from entering the territory on their own, with only a few allowed in on controlled military-led tours. The film argues that this restriction places the entire burden of reporting on Palestinian journalists, many of whom have been killed.

          <p>The Australian film "Together" has faced backlash in China after it was discovered that scenes were digitally altered for its advance screenings to change a same-sex couple into a heterosexual one. Chinese cinemagoers noticed the modification, which replaced a man's face with a woman's, and also observed that other references to the gay relationship were removed. The film's global distributor, Neon, condemned the unauthorized edit and demanded that the Chinese distributor cease its distribution. This incident has reignited criticism of China's censorship of LGBTQ+ content, with many online commentators calling the alteration a disrespectful distortion.</p>

Despite the bullpen squandering a three-run lead in the eighth inning, the team showed resilience. A go-ahead RBI single from Tommy Edman in the 11th inning secured the hard-fought win, showcasing the team's adaptability as they head towards the postseason.</p>

          <p>An Israeli missile strike in Qatar has intensified discussions about the formation of a regional defense alliance among Arab and Islamic nations. The attack has shaken assumptions about the reliability of U.S. security guarantees, pushing Gulf states toward greater strategic autonomy. While a formal NATO-style pact with a mutual defense clause is considered unrealistic, experts suggest a more likely outcome is a "6+2" security arrangement involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council states plus Turkey and Egypt. This would focus on collectivizing defense postures and enhancing intelligence sharing to create a stronger deterrent in the region.</p>
