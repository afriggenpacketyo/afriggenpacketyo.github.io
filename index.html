          <p>Residents in Gaza are confronting a severe humanitarian crisis, marked by widespread starvation and a desperate daily search for food. Personal accounts describe families going without bread, children crying from hunger, and people collapsing in the streets due to malnutrition. International aid organizations report that a significant portion of the population is starving, with acute malnutrition cases among children nearly tripling. The situation is exacerbated by the limited entry of aid trucks and the dangers at distribution points, forcing many to choose between the risk of bombardment and death from hunger.</p>

          <p>India is under increased pressure to conclude a trade deal with the United States before an August 1st deadline, after which certain tariffs are set to rise. A key sticking point remains U.S. demands for greater market access for agricultural products, which India has resisted to protect its farmers. Strategically, the U.S. views India as a crucial partner to counterbalance China's influence in the Indo-Pacific and global supply chains. India is also navigating its role within the BRICS bloc, using its position to maintain leverage in negotiations with Washington while pursuing other trade agreements.</p>

          <h2>Volkswagen Lowers Annual Forecast After U.S. Tariffs Cause Significant Profit Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:54:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, largely attributing the decline to the impact of U.S. tariffs. The company now expects a lower operating return on sales and has revised its sales growth forecast to be flat compared to the previous year. Volkswagen's CFO cited increased U.S. import tariffs, restructuring costs, and higher sales of lower-margin electric vehicles as key factors. The announcement highlights the vulnerability of the European auto sector to ongoing trade policy uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon against Reinier de Ridder, nine months after a severe facial injury where his bottom teeth were caved in. Whittaker spoke about the unsettling injury, the subsequent surgery to install dental implants, and how his life has improved since. Now 34, the Australian fighter states that his primary motivation is no longer just regaining the title but setting an example for his children.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, a significant diplomatic move amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The decision, which Israel condemned as a "reward for terror," makes France the largest Western power to take this step, potentially encouraging others to follow suit. The Palestinian Authority welcomed the announcement, viewing it as support for their right to self-determination. The United States voiced strong opposition, stating the move undermines peace efforts and is a setback for the victims of the October 7th attack.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have initiated a five-day strike over a long-standing pay dispute, prompting the National Health Service to take measures to minimize disruption. Unlike previous walkouts that focused solely on emergency care, NHS England has instructed hospitals to maintain non-urgent services where possible, with senior doctors covering for their striking colleagues. The British Medical Association has warned this approach could stretch staff too thinly and risk patient safety. The government has criticized the strike, stating it will undermine recent progress in clearing patient backlogs.</p>

          <p>Mark Bullingham, the chief executive of England's Football Association, has stated there is no need to expand the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football. Amid speculation that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider using VAR for decisions on corner kicks or second yellow cards, Bullingham expressed concerns about increasing game interruptions. He believes the current implementation of VAR, which is limited to goals, penalty decisions, direct red cards, and mistaken identity, is in a "good place." This position suggests the FA will oppose any proposals to widen VAR's scope.</p>

Additionally, Washington is pushing for the removal of the U.K.'s digital services tax, which affects American tech giants.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, arguing that its sanctuary city laws unlawfully obstruct federal immigration enforcement. The legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty CBP officer, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant. The lawsuit claims the city's policies intentionally impede communication between local and federal law enforcement, releasing criminals onto the streets. City officials countered that the laws are essential for public safety, ensuring all residents, regardless of status, feel safe reporting crimes, while critics within the city argue the policies have gone too far.</p>

          <p>The U.K. and Australia have solidified their AUKUS defense partnership by signing a new 50-year treaty to support their respective nuclear-powered submarine programs. The agreement is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and could lead to £20 billion in British exports over the next 25 years. The move reinforces the trilateral security pact, which also includes the United States, at a time when Washington's long-term commitment has faced some uncertainty. The partnership is aimed at shaping collective security in the Indo-Pacific region amid growing concerns over China's military expansion.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a public disagreement over the costs of a major renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. During a joint tour of the construction site, Trump claimed the cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, stating it included a separate building completed five years ago. Despite previously suggesting the project's cost overruns could be grounds for firing Powell, Trump said it was not necessary. He reiterated his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates to spur economic growth.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has successfully made the first direct experimental observation of quantum friction between solid surfaces. While studying folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy loss as heat. The breakthrough finding, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale machines and devices by controlling friction at the quantum level.</p>

However, this explosive growth has created significant challenges, forcing the city to temporarily halt new construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines, water, and roads to catch up.

In her ruling, Justice Maria Carroccia stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The case centered on whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, also consented to subsequent acts with the other four.
