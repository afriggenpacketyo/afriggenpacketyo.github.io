          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new international agreement on Iran's nuclear program, emphasizing the need for strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Speaking in Paris, Wang voiced deep concerns over escalating regional tensions, particularly following recent US and Israeli pre-emptive strikes on Iranian personnel and nuclear facilities, warning of a potential “nuclear disaster.” Beijing, a key ally of Tehran, is intensifying its criticism while simultaneously positioning itself as a responsible power and key mediator in the ongoing conflict. This article highlights China's diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the volatile situation.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut has triumphantly reclaimed his world champion title at the iconic 4th of July hotdog eating contest in Coney Island, fulfilling his sporting destiny after a controversial ban last year. The article details Chestnut's relentless perfectionism, intense training regimen, and aggressive competitive attitude, likening him to a "Messi of elite eating." It explores the event's paradoxical nature, questioning its seriousness while viewing it as a profound reflection of America's complex relationship with food and consumption.

          <p>Heavy rainfall has triggered "catastrophic" flooding across Texas, resulting in at least 24 fatalities, including children, and prompting an extensive search and rescue operation.

President Trump pledged federal aid, calling the deaths "shocking." Officials noted that the National Weather Service's forecast significantly underestimated the rain, leading to the rapid and destructive rise of the Guadalupe River, exacerbating the disaster's impact.</p>

Three supervised outdoor swimming zones, complete with changing rooms and showers, are now accessible, with water quality continuously monitored for safety. The historic ban, in place since 1923 due to severe pollution, was lifted after a substantial €1.4 billion cleanup effort, including new underground storage tanks and upgraded wastewater treatment plants.

          <p>Chinese scientists have made a significant breakthrough, discovering a "genetic switch" that successfully enabled the complete restoration of damaged outer ear tissue in mice, offering substantial hope for future human organ regeneration. Their research, published in the peer-reviewed journal *Science*, revealed that the mice's inability to regenerate stemmed from a deficiency in retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative vital for cell development and tissue repair. By reactivating this "evolutionarily disabled genetic switch," the team achieved full tissue restoration, including cartilage.

          <p>Despite an initial scare, Dodgers' Max Muncy sustained only a bone bruise in his left knee and is expected to miss about six weeks, avoiding a season-ending injury. This positive diagnosis means the Dodgers are not altering their trade deadline plans, opting to rely on internal options until Muncy's return, which is anticipated well before the playoffs. General Manager Brandon Gomes and Manager Dave Roberts expressed comfort with this timeline, confident that Muncy can regain his recent strong form and contribute to their pursuit of a second consecutive title.

          <p>A US judge has denied a last-ditch effort to halt the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, clearing the way for their imminent transfer by the Trump administration. The men, convicted of serious crimes and from various countries, face "perilous conditions" in war-torn South Sudan, a country the US government advises against travel. This ruling is the latest in a legal battle over the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign, which migrants argue uses deportation as punishment and raises significant safety concerns.
