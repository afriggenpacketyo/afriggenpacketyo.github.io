          <p>Dr. Noor Abdalla, wife of Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, gave birth to their first child while Khalil remains in ICE custody. Khalil was denied temporary release to attend the birth, prompting outrage from Abdalla who accuses ICE of purposefully causing suffering. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was detained on March 8 and faces deportation proceedings after Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleged his presence threatens efforts to combat anti-Semitism. His lawyers are appealing the deportation effort, denouncing the proceedings as a 'charade of due process'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA announced plans to phase out Yellow 5 and several other synthetic food dyes by the end of next year, following pressure from health advocates and RFK Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' movement. The decision comes after mounting evidence suggests these dyes are harmful, particularly to children, potentially causing neurobehavioral effects like inattentiveness and hyperactivity. While not a complete ban, the FDA's action aims to encourage food companies to use natural alternatives like beet, carrot, and watermelon juice. The move addresses concerns about differing state laws on food dyes and aims to create a more uniform national standard.</p>

Cramer emphasized that recoveries often begin as bear market rallies, and that positive developments, such as President Trump's stance on Jerome Powell, could further boost the market.
