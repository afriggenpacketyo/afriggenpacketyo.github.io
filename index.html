          <p>The disappearance of Jermain Charlo in June 2018 remains unsolved, with law enforcement and the community actively searching for answers. Security footage shows Charlo at The Badlander bar with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, who provided conflicting accounts of her whereabouts after they left the bar. Cellphone data placed Charlo's phone in an area where DeFrance lived, further complicating the investigation, though DeFrance has never been named a suspect. Despite extensive searches and the dedication of Detective Guy Baker, Charlo's family continues to seek justice and closure, hoping for her return and resolution in the case.</p>

NASA's Artemis program and a joint China-Russia project aim to establish permanent lunar bases for scientific research and resource extraction, including water ice and helium-3. These lunar bases could serve as transit points for astronauts traveling to Mars, with lunar resources potentially used to create rocket propellant. The renewed interest in the moon is also expected to spur technological advancements with benefits for life on Earth.</p>

          <h2>Teachers Seek More Flexible Work Options</h2>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, discusses her decision to return to work part-time after having a baby, highlighting the importance of flexible working arrangements for teachers. Cole believes that offering more flexible options, especially for new parents, is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession. The government is attempting to improve this area as part of its pledge to recruit 6,500 new teachers, with the Education Secretary advocating for more schools to offer flexible hours. However, data suggests a decline in the overall number of teachers and trainee teacher recruitment targets are still being missed.</p>

          <p>The British government's plan to modernize and potentially expand its nuclear arsenal undermines international non-proliferation efforts and fuels a global arms race. This decision contradicts the spirit of the non-proliferation treaty and sends a cynical signal to other nations. The article argues that retaining nuclear weapons does not enhance Britain's safety and diverts resources from essential public services. It advocates for gradual disarmament as the only way to escape the nightmare of nuclear warfare, criticizing the government's PR campaign to justify its nuclear policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's self-enrichment since starting his 2024 campaign raises concerns about the transformation of the political system. The influx of foreign money into his family's ventures and the personalization of power mirror the corrupt practices of authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban. This fusion of political and personal interests erodes checks and balances, weakens ethical frameworks, and enriches oligarchs at the expense of institutions, posing a fundamental danger to American democracy.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, demonstrates the potential of tellurium nanowire implants for treating human blindness. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert light into electrical signals, offering a promising alternative to traditional photoreceptor cells in the retina. The advance offers significant promise for treating human blindness.</p>

This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce.
