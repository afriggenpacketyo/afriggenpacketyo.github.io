          <p>The Trump administration is deploying 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump signed a memorandum to address the "lawlessness" in California, where demonstrations opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations are ongoing. California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move, calling it "purposefully inflammatory" and warning that it will escalate tensions. The deployment follows clashes between demonstrators and authorities during the protests. Optimism regarding the situation remains low given the heightened tensions and potential for further conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The article highlights the need for innovative policies to address the demographic challenges and promote economic stability.</p>

Founders insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to compete globally. They highlight that Europe's most successful companies achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork, contrasting with the "move fast and break things" ethos often associated with Silicon Valley. </p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum to potentially halve the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, a move that has polarized the country. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is boycotting the vote, calling the current law "excellent" and "very open." Supporters of the referendum argue it would integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to Italian society. Opponents claim it would dilute Italian identity, highlighting the sensitive issue of immigration in the country.</p>

The initiative aims to attract over 10 million users in the next decade, offering certificates to registered nonresidents who frequently visit or donate to these areas. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hopes the program will revitalize regional economies and reverse the trend of overconcentration in major cities. Critics, however, question the plan's novelty and its ability to foster economic growth.</p>
