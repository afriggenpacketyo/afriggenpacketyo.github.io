          <p>An analysis reveals that the Trump administration's attacks on Harvard and other liberal arts colleges are part of a decades-long Republican effort. This effort aims to undermine universities due to the perception that college-educated voters favor the Democratic party. The Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership outlines specific actions against universities, which the Trump administration is now implementing. The goal is to shift funding to trade schools and counter what conservatives see as a left-leaning bias in higher education.</p>

          <p>Around 15,000 protesters gathered in Budapest to demonstrate against the government of Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. Speakers criticized what they see as the government's increasingly anti-democratic conduct and alleged corruption. The protest follows a series of laws, including one banning public LGBTQ+ events, that have drawn criticism. Demonstrators warned that a draft bill targeting critical media organizations and NGOs would further erode independent journalism.</p>

          <h2>US Military's Reliance on China's Rare Earths Highlighted</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 01:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US defense sector's dependence on China for critical minerals, essential for advanced weapon systems, is raising concerns. China dominates the global supply of rare earths and other key materials, giving it leverage in trade and defense. Export restrictions from Beijing pose a growing risk to military readiness and supply chain security. The US defense industry's reliance on these materials makes it vulnerable to disruptions and limitations imposed by China.</p>
