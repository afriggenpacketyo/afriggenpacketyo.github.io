          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rejected him as a customer, forcing him to use smaller banks. He alleged this was due to regulatory pressure under the Biden administration. In response, the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to investigate and potentially fine banks for denying services based on political grounds. JPMorgan denied closing accounts for political reasons but agreed that regulatory changes are needed to address the issue of "de-banking."</p>

          <p>Financial experts are examining whether buying an annuity is a wise decision for individuals at age 70, highlighting both potential benefits and drawbacks. For healthy individuals with a long life expectancy, an annuity can provide a guaranteed, higher-paying income stream, especially in the current high-interest-rate environment. However, the decision involves trade-offs such as illiquidity of the principal, potentially high fees, and reduced inheritance for heirs. The article suggests that the optimal age depends heavily on personal health, financial goals, and existing income sources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has responded to the escalating trade dispute between the United States and India, stating that New Delhi has the sovereign right to choose its trading partners. This comment came after President Trump threatened to impose substantial tariffs on India for purchasing discounted Russian oil, which he claims fuels Russia's war efforts. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov characterized the US threats as illegitimate attempts to coerce nations into ceasing trade with Russia. The dispute highlights the geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia's oil exports and its economic ties with countries like India.</p>

This potential move has sparked alarm among the families of hostages, who fear for their loved ones' safety, and faces likely condemnation from international allies pushing for a ceasefire. The reports emerge as hundreds of retired Israeli security officials, including former intelligence chiefs, signed a letter urging the US to pressure Netanyahu to end the war, arguing that further military action is futile and only strengthens Hamas's ideology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has publicly condemned the decision to place former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest, intensifying a campaign to support the far-right leader. Bolsonaro was confined to his home and had his phone seized by a Brazilian Supreme Court judge for violating a court order. The Trump administration has backed Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss, calling the proceedings a "witch-hunt" and imposing sanctions on the presiding judge. This U.S. intervention has been celebrated by Bolsonaro's supporters but decried by others as a violation of Brazil's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A satirical piece from The Atlantic imagines a near-future America in 2029 where health policy is dictated by pseudoscientific and anti-science beliefs. In this fictional world, citizens are forced to wear health-monitoring wearables, use leeches before taking medicine, and consume roadkill as part of a new Presidential Fitness Test. The commentary critiques the potential consequences of elevating conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated health claims to the level of national policy. The narrative follows two friends navigating a society where scientific evidence has been replaced by anecdotal stories and "good energy."</p>

          <p>The Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has made a public request for people to donate their unwanted pets, such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and chickens, to be used as food for its predator animals. The zoo stated that providing "whole prey" is essential for the predators' welfare and mimics their natural diet. The animals are euthanized by trained staff before being used as fodder. The controversial policy, which also includes accepting horses, has generated a strong public response, prompting the zoo to limit comments on its social media post after receiving "hateful" feedback.</p>

          <p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has strongly criticized a reported plan by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a full military conquest of the Gaza Strip, calling it an "outrageous" and "very bad idea." Olmert warned that such an action would lead to an "endless war" with numerous casualties on both sides and prevent the return of remaining hostages. He argued that the only way to defeat Hamas's ideology is to offer a better future, not through continued military force.

The technology sector has seen the most significant cuts, with over 27,000 jobs eliminated due to AI since 2023.

          <p>U.S. consumers may soon face significant price increases on Swiss products like luxury watches, artisan chocolates, and premium skincare if a 39% tariff goes into effect. The proposed rate, one of the highest under the U.S. "reciprocal tariff" policy, has stunned Swiss businesses and negotiators who are scrambling to avert it. The tariffs would heavily impact the Swiss watch industry, which counts the U.S. as its largest market, and could cause steep business losses for smaller chocolatiers who produce exclusively in Switzerland. Major industries like pharmaceuticals and precious metals are currently exempt.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his rhetoric against Russia, stating its economy "stinks" and suggesting that lower oil prices are the key to stopping its "war machine" in Ukraine. His comments follow a recent souring of relations, with Trump shortening the deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal before facing "secondary tariffs" on its trade partners. This has led to sharp responses from Russian officials. Trump also reiterated his threat to significantly raise tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil, linking it directly to funding the conflict.</p>

China's strategic need for a stable and secure energy supply, combined with its strong energy cooperation with Russia, makes the trade mutually beneficial. The US has already acted against India for similar trade, placing China as the next likely target for pressure.

          <p>A new analysis suggests that Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has become a key incubator for future leaders in the restaurant industry. Many executives who started or spent significant time at Yum have gone on to lead major rival chains, including the CEOs of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel. Experts attribute this trend to the company's strong focus on leadership development, its massive global footprint, and a "people first" culture established by past CEOs. The intense internal competition for top roles often leads high-performing executives to seek CEO positions elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock jumped over 8% after the software analytics company reported a "truly anomalous quarter" and raised its full-year financial outlook. The company surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, driven by surging demand for its AI platforms and strong growth in U.S. government and commercial contracts. CEO Alex Karp credited the exceptional results to the current AI wave and the government's focus on efficiency.

In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, posting a 4% increase in same-store sales, although this was still slightly below analysts' higher projections.
