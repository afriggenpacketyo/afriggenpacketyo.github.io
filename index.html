          <p>Nadine Dorries, a former Conservative culture secretary and a staunch ally of Boris Johnson, has defected to Reform UK, declaring that the Tory Party is "dead." In a statement, she expressed that her core beliefs have not changed, but the Conservative party has, leading to her decision after 12 months of consideration. Dorries cited Nigel Farage as the only politician with the necessary answers on key issues like law and order, immigration, and public spending. Her defection follows those of other prominent Conservatives, signaling a significant shift in the UK's right-wing political landscape.</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement is unconstitutional. The suit, which names President Trump and other top officials as defendants, seeks a permanent injunction to halt the troop presence. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb contends that the move violates democratic principles by militarizing law enforcement and has caused irreparable harm. The White House defended the action as a lawful measure to combat violent crime and protect federal assets.</p>

          <p>During a contentious Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended his changes to U.S. immunization policy while promoting unsubstantiated claims about vaccines. He expressed agreement with a new appointee who stated that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk, a claim contrary to extensive scientific evidence. Kennedy also clashed with senators over access to COVID-19 shots, asserting he was not limiting them despite new FDA guidelines restricting eligibility. The hearing highlighted the deep political divisions over public health and the administration's departure from established scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is appealing a court decision that overturned a nearly $500 million penalty against Donald Trump and his company in their civil fraud case. An appellate court had previously voided the fine, ruling that it violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against excessive fines. However, that same court upheld the underlying verdict that Trump and his associates committed business fraud by inflating asset values. James is now asking the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, to reinstate the substantial financial penalty.</p>

          <p>A new bill introduced by congressional Democrats, titled the "You Earn It, You Keep it Act," aims to permanently eliminate all federal taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the revenue loss and bolster the program's solvency, the proposal would expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000. This legislation contrasts with a recent Republican law that offers a temporary, income-limited deduction for seniors. Proponents argue this new bill would provide more substantial relief to retirees and extend the Social Security trust fund's lifespan by over two decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Neil Hopper, an NHS vascular surgeon, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography. The court heard that Hopper intentionally used ice to freeze his own legs, leading to a necessary double amputation, which he then falsely claimed was the result of sepsis to collect over £466,000 from insurers. Investigations revealed Hopper had a long-standing sexual interest in amputation and body mutilation, which also led to the pornography charges. The hospital trust where he worked stated that reviews found no evidence of harm to his patients.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares fell more than 5% after the company issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, deepening its year-to-date decline to 27%. While the software giant's second-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded expectations, its third-quarter guidance fell short of analyst projections. The slump reflects ongoing investor concerns about the future of the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry in the face of the AI boom. Despite challenges in its marketing and commerce divisions, CEO Marc Benioff remained optimistic, dismissing concerns about AI's threat to the company's business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Pride in London, Christopher Joell-Deshields, has been suspended pending an internal investigation into multiple serious allegations. He is accused of misusing sponsor-donated vouchers to purchase luxury personal items and fostering a toxic, bullying culture within the organization. The claims, brought forward by volunteer directors, have raised concerns among current and former volunteers about potential damage to one of Europe's largest Pride events. A new board of directors has been formed to oversee the investigation, while Joell-Deshields has disputed the board's authority to suspend him.</p>

          <p>Northwestern University President Michael H. Schill has announced his resignation following a period of significant turmoil, including steep federal research funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. The nearly $800 million reduction in funding forced the university to eliminate approximately 425 jobs. Schill also faced intense scrutiny from conservatives over the university's handling of campus protests related to the Gaza conflict. In his resignation message, Schill cited these extraordinary challenges and stated that it was the right time for new leadership to guide the institution forward.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has proposed that universities could be required to charge different tuition fees based on the quality of their teaching. The suggestion of "differential fee levels" is presented as a potential incentive for institutions to improve educational standards. Currently, most universities charge a uniform undergraduate fee of £9,535, but this proposal could lead to variable pricing based on OfS ratings like gold, silver, or bronze. The final decision on fee structures rests with the government, which is expected to outline its funding plans this autumn.</p>

The company's third-quarter revenue forecast, while projecting around 33% growth, did not seem to satisfy market expectations for the high-growth stock.

The proposal, which follows a ministerial visit to Estonia to study its comprehensive digital ID system, revives a long-standing debate over privacy and civil liberties.
