          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote on a war powers resolution aimed at restricting President Trump's ability to take further military action against Iran without congressional approval. The vote follows recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which have sparked anger among Democrats who claim the administration has not been transparent about the intelligence or the extent of the damage. While the White House asserts Iran's nuclear program was set back by years, some lawmakers leaving classified briefings remain skeptical of these claims. The resolution faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Senate, but sponsors argue it is crucial for Congress to assert its constitutional authority over declaring war.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, surged to new record highs, driven by investor optimism about potential trade deals with China and India. This rally marks a significant turnaround from a recent bear market, fueled by calmer White House rhetoric on tariffs and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Despite the positive momentum, some analysts express caution, suggesting that market complacency regarding trade and tariff issues could pose future risks. The market also digested new data showing a slight increase in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a U.S.-brokered peace deal in Washington, aiming to end decades of conflict fueled by armed rebel groups in eastern DR Congo. The agreement calls for the disarmament of militias like M23, which Rwanda is accused of backing, and the FDLR, which DR Congo is accused of supporting. However, the deal lacks specific details on the withdrawal of thousands of Rwandan troops from Congolese territory, a major point of contention. While hailed as a diplomatic success, the ambiguity of the terms leaves critical questions unanswered, casting doubt on its long-term effectiveness compared to previous failed peace efforts.</p>

Representing parts of Queens as a state assemblyman, Mamdani ran a grassroots campaign focused on high visibility and direct engagement with voters, reminiscent of former mayor Ed Koch's famous "How'm I doin'?" approach. His victory represents a significant win for the progressive wing of the Democratic party in one of the nation's most prominent political arenas. The article suggests that while his progressive stance is framed as a challenge to Donald Trump, it may also present opportunities for the former president.</p>

          <p>A Honduran woman is suing the U.S. government for the release of her family after she and her two young children were detained by ICE agents outside a Los Angeles immigration court. The lawsuit challenges the legality of their detention in a Texas facility, particularly given that her 6-year-old son is a cancer survivor requiring ongoing medical monitoring. The family had followed legal protocols, applying for asylum through the CBP One app and being paroled into the country. Their attorneys argue the detention violates their due process rights, as they were apprehended immediately after a judge dismissed a prior removal case at the government's request.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court concluded its term with a series of significant decisions, delivering several victories for the Trump administration and conservative causes. In a major ruling, the court limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a tool often used to block executive policies like the president's birthright citizenship order. The court also sided with parents seeking to opt their children out of school lessons with LGBTQ+ characters, upheld a key preventive care provision of the Affordable Care Act, and allowed a Texas age-verification law for pornographic websites to stand. Other decisions involved Louisiana's congressional redistricting and state funding for Planned Parenthood.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated his government has found the "right balance" on welfare reform after making significant concessions to avert a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The initial plan to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) will now only apply to new claimants, protecting existing recipients. Additionally, the government reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit and will fast-track a Â£1 billion work support package. Despite the compromise satisfying many, some Labour MPs still plan to vote against the bill, arguing the changes do not go far enough to protect vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue universal injunctions, which have been used to block presidential policies on a national scale. The 6-3 ruling came in a case related to President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship, although the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such broad injunctions likely exceed the power granted to federal courts by Congress. This decision strengthens the executive branch's ability to implement major policies, as it prevents a single judge from halting a policy nationwide while legal challenges proceed.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing parents to opt their children out of school lessons featuring LGBTQ+ characters, California officials must now re-evaluate state education policies. The ruling, which stemmed from a case in Maryland, allows families to excuse their children from content that conflicts with their religious beliefs. While California law mandates LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum, this decision means individual families can now refuse participation in those specific lessons. The judgment creates potential administrative challenges for schools and has sparked debate among civil rights groups, who fear it undermines inclusive education, and religious freedom advocates, who praise it as a victory for parental rights.</p>

The Â£1 billion program, intended to help benefit claimants find work, was moved up from a 2029 start date as part of a compromise on welfare reforms. However, sources told the BBC that the program lacks a coherent plan, sufficient staffing, and the necessary pace to be effective.

          <p>The Supreme Court has announced it will hear further arguments regarding Louisiana's new congressional map, which includes a second majority-Black district. This decision keeps the current map, used in the 2024 elections, in place for the time being. The case stems from a yearslong legal battle over whether the state's district lines unfairly dilute Black voting power, violating the Voting Rights Act. After an initial map was struck down, the GOP-led legislature created the new map, which was then challenged by another group as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court's eventual ruling will have significant implications for representation and the balance of power in Congress.</p>

However, some Democratic lawmakers and nuclear experts expressed concern after classified briefings, suggesting that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium may not have been destroyed, potentially leaving it with a short breakout time to a nuclear weapon.

          <p>U.S. businesses are beginning to implement price increases on consumer goods and are maintaining smaller inventories due to the economic uncertainty caused by tariffs and the ongoing trade war. A logistics firm reports re-ticketing millions of products with price increases of 8% to 15%, a practice not seen on this scale since the pandemic. Retailers and manufacturers are also shrinking their inventory footprints to mitigate risks associated with trade policy and potential consumer softness. This trend, combined with a decrease in shipping container traffic, suggests a milder-than-usual peak season for holiday inventory, signaling a cautious approach across the supply chain.

Humberside Fire and Rescue has deployed multiple crews, advising residents to keep windows and doors closed due to the smoke and odor.

          <p>A bison died after falling into the scalding water of the Grand Prismatic Spring at Yellowstone National Park in front of tourists. Witnesses reported that the animal appeared to stumble near the edge of the spring before falling in and being unable to escape the nearly boiling water. Park officials confirmed that while such incidents are rare, especially in popular tourist areas, they are not unheard of, as animals can misjudge the thin crust around thermal features. The event serves as a stark reminder for visitors to remain on designated boardwalks and maintain a safe distance from both the park's wildlife and its dangerous geothermal landscapes.</p>

The article commends the film for avoiding common tropes of medical suffering and instead focusing on Ruth's internal experience and the complex relationship between caregivers and residents. Chalfant's performance is highlighted as a brilliant and commanding characterization that captures the fluidity of identity and emotion in a person living with the condition, presenting a full human being rather than just a patient.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network and its anchor Jesse Watters knowingly lied by claiming the governor was untruthful about a phone call with President Donald Trump. Newsom's complaint argues that Fox News distorted the facts to curry favor with the former president and acted with ill will toward the governor. In exchange for dropping the lawsuit, Newsom is demanding a retraction and a formal on-air apology from Watters and the network, stating he will continue fighting their "propaganda machine."</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, many consumers are exploring relief options like debt settlement, where creditors agree to accept less than the full amount owed. This article explains that while there's no official cap, settlement becomes less effective for debts exceeding $100,000, as creditors are more likely to pursue lawsuits for larger sums. The process requires saving a significant lump sum for settlement offers, and fees for professional services can be substantial. For those with overwhelming debt, alternatives like debt consolidation loans, credit counseling, or, in extreme cases, bankruptcy might be more practical solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

The case is the first of its kind since a Louisiana law was upheld allowing survivors to sue for damages regardless of when the abuse occurred. The plaintiff, John Lousteau, was abused at a summer camp run by the order and has since suffered from addiction and PTSD.

Kuniskis acknowledged that past issues with pricing and a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500 contributed to the brand's slump.
