          <p>In 2023, the spouse of a U.S. senator was placed on a government watchlist due to a flagged travel profile. Following contact between New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and TSA officials, her husband, William Shaheen, was removed from the "Quiet Skies" program, which subjects individuals to increased scrutiny. He was subsequently placed on a different list that exempted him from advanced screening. The spokesperson for Sen. Shaheen stated that she contacted TSA after her husband was subjected to several extensive, invasive and degrading searches at airport checkpoints and was seeking to understand the nature and cause. William Shaheen was recently removed from the list of people excluded from any enhanced surveillance. The circumstances surrounding his initial listing and subsequent removal raise concerns about political influence within security protocols.</p>

          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being implemented in buildings to reduce energy consumption and costs. The system freezes water during nighttime hours when electricity rates are lower, storing the ice to cool buildings during peak daytime hours. This process can cut cooling costs by up to 40% and reduce strain on the power grid during peak demand. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials that require less energy to freeze, potentially expanding the applicability of energy storage systems. Rising electricity bills are expected this summer, making energy storage solutions increasingly important.</p>

          <p>A group of six Nobel laureate economists have criticized a budget bill passed by the House, stating it would significantly increase the U.S. debt and exacerbate inequality. The economists argue the bill's proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps would harm millions of Americans, while tax cuts would disproportionately benefit higher-income households. They predict the bill would add over $3 trillion to the national debt, putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The Trump administration defends the bill as a chance to cut spending and stimulate economic growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a new regulation that would prevent most asylum seekers from obtaining work permits. This proposal would effectively suspend the long-standing U.S. policy of allowing asylum applicants to work legally while their cases are pending. Officials argue this change is necessary to combat exploitation of the asylum system by economic migrants. Critics contend that restricting work permits could force migrants into the underground economy and prevent them from supporting themselves and their families.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lifted restrictions imposed on Wells Fargo following the bank's fake-accounts scandal. The restrictions, in place since 2018, limited the bank's growth due to a toxic sales culture. CEO Charlie Scharf announced a $2,000 award for each of the 215,000 employees for turning the bank around. With the asset cap removed, Wells Fargo can now pursue growth opportunities, including increased deposits and new accounts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly planning to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. Documents also show that other vessels named after prominent leaders are also on the Navy's renaming "recommended list," including the USNS Thurgood Marshall and the USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's directive to cease heritage or awareness month events is cited as a factor. The documents suggest a desire to realign the military with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture."</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests President Trump's actions are making it difficult for the market to accurately value stocks. He argues that Trump's tariffs and approach to international relations encourage short sellers and misguided investment decisions. Cramer believes Wall Street is overly skeptical about the need for artificial intelligence infrastructure. He claims Trump has revived short selling, but these sellers can lose when businesses perform well (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Three transgender cadets who met all Air Force Academy graduation standards were denied commissions due to a newly reinstated Trump administration ban. The cadets, the first out transgender graduates, were placed on administrative absence and barred from taking the oath. The decision is based on their gender identity, not their performance or qualifications. The cadets' situation highlights the impact of policy changes on individuals who have met all requirements for service.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly expressed private frustration with his Supreme Court appointees, particularly Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Sources claim Trump feels the justices could do more to support his agenda. Some Trump allies have labeled Barrett as "weak." Trump is said to be looking to nominate judges in the mold of Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Antonin Scalia moving forward.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will not attend a meeting of over 50 defense leaders to coordinate military aid to Ukraine. Hegseth's absence marks the first time the U.S. Pentagon chief will miss the meeting since its inception. The move is viewed as another step by the U.S. to distance itself from the Ukraine war effort. Hegseth previously warned Ukraine to abandon its NATO bid and signaled a shift towards Europe assuming more financial responsibility for Ukraine's defense.</p>
