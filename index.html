          <h2>UK Government to Publicize Nationalities of Foreign Offenders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 00:29:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will, for the first time, publish the nationalities of foreign criminals residing in the country, a move the Conservatives claim is a result of their pressure on the Labour government. Official data indicates that over 19,000 foreign offenders were awaiting deportation at the end of the previous year, an increase from the nearly 18,000 when the Conservatives were in power. The Home Secretary has instructed officials to release data showing the nationalities and crimes of those awaiting deportation, with the most common offenses among foreign criminals being drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault. The government insists this change is due to their efforts to address an issue ignored by their predecessors.</p>

          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring Asian countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The shrine honors Japan's war dead, including wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, causing diplomatic friction with China and South Korea, which were invaded and occupied by Japan during the war. A lawmaker emphasized the importance of remembering the history of those who contributed to Japan's peaceful post-war prosperity, while the visit occurs amid ongoing sensitivity surrounding Japan's wartime past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The declining value of the U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide, as appreciating local currencies can ease inflation but also harm export competitiveness. A weaker dollar eases the debt burden for emerging markets with dollar-denominated debts and allows for potential interest rate cuts to stimulate growth. However, currency devaluation risks triggering capital flight and could be perceived as a trade measure inviting retaliation from the U.S. Ultimately, central banks are trying to avoid a currency war that could destabilize the global economy.</p>
