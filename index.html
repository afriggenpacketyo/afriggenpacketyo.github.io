          <h2>Tesla's Second Quarter Earnings Disappoint with Falling Revenue and Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 16:41:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has reported a significant downturn in its second-quarter financial results, missing analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's automotive revenue saw a 16% year-over-year decline, marking the second consecutive quarter of falling sales, with vehicle deliveries also dropping by 14%. This slump is partly linked to public backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and increased competition from other automakers. While Tesla attempts to shift focus towards future projects like a more affordable model and its robotaxi service, it currently lags behind rivals in the autonomous vehicle space.</p>

          <p>Alphabet announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's revenue and earnings per share expectations. The company reported strong growth in its search, advertising, and cloud computing divisions, with overall revenue increasing by 14% year-over-year. However, Alphabet also revealed plans to increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion, primarily to support the growing demand for its AI and cloud services. The company highlighted significant user growth for its AI products, with AI Overviews reaching 2 billion monthly users and the Gemini app surpassing 450 million.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Potential Interest Earnings from 6-Month CDs and High-Yield Savings Accounts</h2>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of locking funds in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus maintaining liquidity with a high-yield savings account. This article analyzes the potential interest earned on a $10,000 deposit over six months, showing that a CD currently offers a slightly higher, guaranteed return compared to the variable rate of a savings account. With interest rates expected to fall, the fixed rate of a CD provides protection against this decline. The analysis concludes that for those who can afford to set aside funds, a CD may be the more profitable and secure option. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission aims to provide critical data on space weather, which can disrupt GPS signals, power grids, and endanger astronauts. Flying in tandem, the satellites will measure how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere, driving phenomena like auroras and potentially harmful electrical currents. The launch also deployed several other small satellites for various research purposes, including testing 5G communications and measuring Earth's energy balance.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with the termination of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The decision sides with the administration's argument for greater executive control over independent agencies, continuing a trend of the court not intervening to reinstate officials fired by the president. The court's unsigned order, which came over the dissent of its three liberal justices, cited a previous ruling that the government faces greater harm from a removed officer continuing to serve than the officer faces from being terminated. The three commissioners were appointed by the previous administration for fixed terms.</p>

In a related development, a New York judge denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request to review grand jury materials from her own case, ruling she had not demonstrated a compelling necessity for access.

While net sales saw a modest 3% rise due to new restaurant openings, the underlying performance indicates a consumer pullback, which executives attribute to broader economic concerns.

The plot centers on the team confronting the world-devouring entity Galactus, presenting a lean narrative about self-control versus gluttony.

          <p>A discussion with exercise metabolism researcher Tim Podlogar reveals the critical role of carbohydrate consumption in the performance of elite cyclists competing in the Tour de France. To sustain the extreme physical demands of the multi-stage race, athletes must consume thousands of calories daily, with a significant focus on carbohydrates to fuel their muscles and aid recovery. This nutritional strategy, often referred to as a carbohydrate revolution, involves precise planning and intake of gels, drinks, and solid foods during and after each stage. The approach is essential for maintaining energy levels and preventing fatigue over the grueling three-week event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street analysts have a pessimistic outlook for Tesla's upcoming second-quarter earnings report, predicting an 11% year-over-year revenue decline. The electric vehicle maker has faced a difficult year marked by falling stock prices, increased competition, and significant public backlash against CEO Elon Musk for his political role in the Trump administration. This negative sentiment has been linked to a 14% drop in vehicle deliveries and a nearly 28% fall in new-car sales in Europe. The company's brand image appears to have been tarnished by its leader's actions, creating a significant threat to its future growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released an AI Action Plan designed to accelerate artificial intelligence development by removing "bureaucratic red tape" and easing federal regulations. The initiative reflects the policy influence of Silicon Valley executives who have supported the administration, aiming to help U.S. companies win the global AI race against competitors like China. The plan focuses on speeding up permits for data centers and other infrastructure, contrasting with the previous administration's approach that also emphasized potential risks. Critics, including civil rights and environmental groups, argue the plan prioritizes corporate interests over public well-being and safety.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is facing significant public and international criticism after signing a law that curtails the independence of the country's key anti-corruption bodies. The new legislation places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) under the control of the president-appointed prosecutor general. This has sparked the largest anti-government protests since the 2022 invasion, with thousands demonstrating in Kyiv. Western allies, including the European Commission, have expressed strong concerns that the move undermines the rule of law, a core requirement for Ukraine's EU membership aspirations.</p>

Vaughan argues that Dawson's all-around package—consistent bowling, reliable batting, and solid fielding—is exactly what England needs, particularly on home pitches.
