          <p>West Virginia's governor is sending 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington D.C. to support the Trump administration's federal intervention in the city's policing. This action follows a presidential executive order that federalized the local police force and activated D.C.'s own Guard troops, citing concerns over crime and homelessness. The move has prompted protests from residents who oppose what they describe as a "military occupation," while city leaders navigate their forced cooperation. The White House confirmed that deployed troops may be armed, reversing earlier guidance from the Defense Department.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days. The man, who was rappelling the Seven Teacups waterfalls, was forced off his climbing lines by the strong water hydraulics. The Tulare County Sheriff's Office initiated an extensive search after he was reported missing, eventually locating him with a drone. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being safely reunited with his family, prompting officials to remind the public about the dangers of navigating whitewater rivers.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds reaching 160 mph. While its outer bands are impacting the northern Leeward Islands, the storm's center is forecast to remain at sea, passing north of Puerto Rico. Tropical storm watches have been issued for several islands, with warnings of heavy rain, potential flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions. Current forecast models show the hurricane curving northward and staying well offshore of the U.S. East Coast, though meteorologists continue to monitor its path closely.</p>

          <p>Guatemalan authorities successfully secured the release of nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The riots began in two separate prisons earlier in the week, as members of the country's largest gangs demanded the return of transferred leaders. This incident followed the release of another 11 guards who were also taken hostage under similar circumstances. The events highlight the ongoing power struggle and violent rivalry between the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs within Guatemala's prison system.</p>

The announcement comes amid considerations for redeveloping the event's venue and past criticism regarding the commercialization of Indigenous culture.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, introducing diverse, authentic regional cuisines that go far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Using Singapore as a launchpad, brands are showcasing specific culinary traditions from regions like Hunan and Zhejiang, challenging old stereotypes about Chinese food. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a form of soft power, potentially improving China's global image more effectively than official government efforts. While this trend creates new competition for local businesses, it offers diners a more sophisticated and immersive glimpse into China's vast gastronomic culture.</p>

This statement represents a significant shift from earlier guidance from a Defense Department official, who had indicated that troops would not carry weapons at the request of local law enforcement. The Guard's mission is to protect federal assets and provide a secure environment, but they will not have the authority to make arrests. The deployment is part of a presidential order that federalized the city's police force to address crime.</p>

          <p>A new collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity. The recordings, made at RCA Records' Hollywood studio, include his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads reflecting his personal turmoil. The article reflects on this period, where Presley was somewhat disconnected from the evolving rock scene he helped create. It also recounts a missed opportunity to co-star with Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," a disappointment that friends believe marked a turning point before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump reportedly told European leaders he would support a peace deal that involves Ukraine ceding the Donbas region to Russia. Leaked details from the post-summit call indicate Putin demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk in exchange for freezing the current frontlines elsewhere. This position represents a significant break from the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, who oppose changing international borders by force. European leaders have cautiously welcomed peace efforts but insist that Ukraine must ultimately make all decisions regarding its own territory.</p>

          <p>Norfolk Police arrested 13 individuals in Norwich for displaying support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The protestors were holding placards outside City Hall and were arrested on suspicion of violating the Terrorism Act 2000. The arrests follow the proscription of the group in July, which makes membership or public support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban has been criticized by human rights groups, and Palestine Action is currently challenging its proscription in the High Court.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian political analysts have expressed deep disappointment with the Alaska summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, viewing it as a diplomatic victory for Russia with no tangible benefits for Ukraine. Experts suggest Putin achieved his goal of ending his international isolation and legitimizing his position without making any real concessions. Many Ukrainians fear that the upcoming talks in Washington will result in increased pressure on President Zelenskyy to accept unfavorable terms, such as territorial concessions. The summit's optics, including a red carpet for Putin, were widely condemned on Ukrainian social media.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that President Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. The statement came after the Alaska summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin, which did not result in a ceasefire agreement but did pave the way for further talks involving Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Starmer emphasized that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support. He also noted that Western allies would continue to tighten sanctions on Russia until its "barbaric assault" ends.</p>

          <p>A Denver man lost $17,000 to a scammer after his call to United Airlines' official customer service number was mysteriously transferred to a fraudulent agent. While trying to rebook a canceled flight, the man spoke with someone who processed the new ticket but also made a separate, unauthorized $17,000 charge under a vague alias. Call logs confirm he dialed the correct number, but United's internal records show a much shorter call duration, and the airline could not explain how the transfer occurred. The incident highlights a sophisticated new type of scam targeting airline customers through official channels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 hurricane was fueled by a combination of ideal atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The storm passed over exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit, which provided the energy for its explosive growth. Additionally, low wind shear and a compact core allowed the storm to strengthen efficiently, with wind speeds increasing by more than 58 mph in a 24-hour period. This phenomenon, known as rapid intensification, is becoming more common due to climate change and warming oceans, making storms more dangerous and harder to predict.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is launching a major comeback, with plans to open new standalone stores and host its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, closing all physical locations, the brand was purchased by online retailer Asos. Now, Topshop aims to recapture its former cultural relevance by returning to the High Street, targeting both nostalgic millennial shoppers and a new Gen-Z audience. Industry experts note the brand will face challenges in a competitive market but could succeed by reviving its unique "London girl" aesthetic.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his bravery during a 1944 mission where, despite suffering 72 injuries, he piloted his flying boat to destroy a German U-boat. After the war, he left the RAF for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions as his duty. His death marks the passing of the final member of the 181 individuals awarded the Victoria Cross during the conflict.</p>
