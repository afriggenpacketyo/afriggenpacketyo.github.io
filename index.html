        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, due to a slide in food prices, marking its lowest level since February 2019. Food inflation specifically hit 0.99%, significantly below April's 1.78%, with vegetable prices showing a notable decrease. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy in response to these easing inflationary pressures, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate. Economists anticipate further rate cuts, projecting continued subdued inflation for the coming fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Congressional Republicans have overturned California's authority to set national emission standards for new vehicles, trucks, RVs, and engines. The EPA, under President Biden, had previously granted California waivers to the Clean Air Act, allowing the state to impose stringent emission regulations, including a mandate for nearly all vehicles sold in the state to be electric by 2035. This action aims to protect American jobs and ensure that the shift to electric vehicles is driven by innovation and consumer choice, not regulatory mandates. The move is seen as a win for American manufacturing and a reversal of Green New Deal overreach.</p>

Warren and Stansbury outlined recommendations to save over $2 trillion in 10 years, including cracking down on prescription drug middlemen and reforming the estate tax exemption. The letter follows a public dispute between Musk and Trump over a budget bill, despite Musk's initial involvement in the administration's efficiency efforts.</p>

This latest event follows a period of gas-pistoning, where gas accumulates at the top of a lava column. The eruption is ongoing and scientists are monitoring the activity, warning of potential hazards such as volcanic gas and Pele's hair. It is the 25th eruptive episode since the volcano began erupting in December.</p>

          <p>Poundland, a struggling budget chain, has been sold for Â£1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers, potentially leading to the closure of up to 100 stores. The chain, with 825 UK stores and 16,000 staff, has struggled to compete with other discount retailers. Pepco, the previous owner, cited increased employer National Insurance contributions as adding pressure on the chain. Retail analysts suggest Poundland's appeal has waned as consumers seek better quality and value elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, driven by the implementation of global trade tariffs and domestic tax increases. The decline was more significant than economists had anticipated. The imposition of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump created widespread business uncertainty and negatively impacted UK exports. Industrial production and services output saw particularly sharp declines, highlighting the toll of the tariffs on the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Local leaders argue that the recent clashes between National Guard troops, police, and protesters in Los Angeles differ significantly from the 1992 riots following the Rodney King verdict. They emphasize that the current unrest is more limited in scope and that the coordinated response among local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies in 1992 contrasts with the current situation. While some actions by protesters are deemed inappropriate, the area impacted is a small portion of the city. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of federal communication with California and Los Angeles officials.</p>
