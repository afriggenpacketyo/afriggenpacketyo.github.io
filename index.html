          <p>Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, has unveiled its first electric SUV, the YU7, targeting Tesla's Model Y in the Chinese market. Xiaomi claims the YU7 will have a driving range of at least 760 kilometers (472 miles) on a single charge, surpassing the 719 km range advertised for Tesla's extended-range Model Y. Citi analysts predict the YU7 will be priced competitively, between 250,000 yuan to 320,000 yuan ($34,700 to $44,420), and expects monthly sales of around 30,000 units, potentially eroding Tesla's market share. Xiaomi plans to officially launch the YU7 and announce its price in July.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated sales of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move comes as the government seeks to address public criticism regarding its handling of escalating rice prices amid broader inflation concerns. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system that farming cooperatives primarily used. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency of the situation and established a special response team to tackle high rice price issues and prevent consumer abandonment of rice products.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker best known for his documentary ‚ÄúThe Sorrow and the Pity,‚Äù has died at the age of 97. His film challenged the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II, interviewing ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand who either collaborated with the Nazis or turned a blind eye to the persecution of Jews and anti-Nazis. The film, initially banned from French television, sparked controversy and critical acclaim for its dispassionate and incisive examination of wartime France. Ophuls also directed ‚ÄúH√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie,‚Äù which won an Academy Award.</p>

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing duty costs by stripping out the middleman's profit. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention amid recent tariff regimes. To apply the rule, businesses must have at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, sales must be at arm's length, there must be proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price is required.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep facilitates the brain's repair mode by clearing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals accumulated during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, demonstrates that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) acts as a molecular signal, triggering sleep and restoring balance in the brain. Confirming a decades-old hypothesis, the team discovered that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. Excess build-up of free radicals can disrupt sleep quality and cause inflammation, providing critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to express deep concern over "unilateral tariff measures" at their meeting in Malaysia, indirectly referencing the United States. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim noted that ASEAN has shown resilience amid increasingly complex global developments and that the global trading system is under strain due to recent U.S. tariffs. The leaders warn that the unilateral tariffs pose challenges to ASEAN's economic growth and stability, while reaffirming the bloc's commitment to a multilateral trading system.</p>
