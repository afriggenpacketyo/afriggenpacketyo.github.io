        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of U.K. government borrowing decreased, partially reversing a spike that occurred after the finance minister, Rachel Reeves, became emotional during a parliamentary session. The market turbulence was fueled by speculation about her potential resignation, but Prime Minister Keir Starmer's subsequent expression of strong support helped calm investors. Analysts suggest the market's reaction indicates a preference for Reeves to remain in her role to maintain fiscal discipline, despite the challenges posed by recent policy reversals.</p>

The article discusses the health risks associated with additives like Red Dye 40 and titanium dioxide, which are permitted in the U.S. but banned or restricted in the EU. While Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is pushing for reforms, the piece argues that the core issue is America's high consumption of sugar, saturated fats, and excessive calories, regardless of artificial ingredients.</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted the first-ever unmanned semi-submersible vessel designed for drug trafficking, which was notably equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna. The drone "narco sub" was found empty off the Caribbean coast, leading authorities to believe it was on a trial run for the Gulf Clan cartel. This discovery marks a significant technological advancement for traffickers, as unmanned vessels are harder to detect and eliminate the risk of crew members being captured and cooperating with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court has delivered a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision effectively preserves legal access to abortion services throughout the state. The ruling clarifies the legal landscape that had been uncertain following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. The judgment is a pivotal moment for reproductive rights in Wisconsin, settling a key legal question that has been pending for years.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent actions, including the passage of his major domestic spending bill and military strikes on Iran, confirm his presidency as a continuation of established political ideologies. The author contends that despite his populist appeal, Trump has doubled down on neoliberal policies that favor the wealthy and neoconservative foreign policy characterized by military aggression. This analysis suggests that rather than representing a break from the past, Trump's administration has ultimately reinforced the dominant political consensus of the last half-century.</p>

The reviewer highlights Shteyngart's skill in capturing a child's fundamental helplessness and alienation amid adult dysfunction, creating a powerful story that speaks to both our current political moment and enduring childhood predicaments.</p>

          <p>South Korea is experiencing a stark political divide between its young men and women, a trend seen globally but particularly pronounced there. Many young men, feeling disadvantaged in a hypercompetitive job market and resentful of feminism, have shifted to the right, helping elect a conservative president. Experts attribute this phenomenon to socioeconomic changes, including increased competition for jobs and the collapse of traditional marriage dynamics. This has created a complex political landscape where generational animosity and gender conflict are increasingly intertwined.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global's $16 million settlement of President Trump's lawsuit against CBS News' "60 Minutes" has elicited a mixed reaction of anger and relief within the news division. Many journalists are angry over what they see as a corporate capitulation to clear the way for a merger with Skydance Media. However, there is also relief that the settlement did not include a forced apology, which was viewed as a critical line that could not be crossed. The outcome leaves the news organization to navigate an era of heightened media mistrust.</p>

The report concludes that, contrary to White House claims, independent studies show the bill would significantly increase the national deficit by trillions over the next decade. It also confirms that the bill proposes substantial cuts to future Medicaid spending that would cause millions to lose coverage, and clarifies the context behind claims that taxes would otherwise rise dramatically.</p>

          <h2>Republican Governors Remain Largely Silent on Proposed Medicaid Cuts</h2>

          <p>Despite facing multibillion-dollar budget holes, Republican governors in states that expanded Medicaid have been publicly quiet about the historic cuts to the program included in President Trump's legislative bill. This contrasts sharply with 2017, when GOP governors were a key force in blocking similar cuts. The current legislation would reduce enrollment through new work requirements and other policies. The governors' silence is seen as providing political cover for federal lawmakers to pass the measures, which Democrats warn will strip healthcare from millions.</p>
