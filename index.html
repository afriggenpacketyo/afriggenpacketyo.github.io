          <p>The search for the next Federal Reserve chair is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meeting with several potential candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is also reportedly advancing a reform agenda for the central bank, aiming to reduce its economic footprint and organically shrink its massive bond portfolio without disrupting markets. This process occurs amid pressure from the Trump administration for an interest rate cut. The leadership transition could significantly reshape the Federal Reserve's policies and structure in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A majority of Brazil's Supreme Court justices have found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of orchestrating a failed military coup to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. The court ruled that Bolsonaro led a conspiracy that culminated in his supporters storming government buildings in January 2023. With three out of five justices voting to convict, the verdict was secured, marking the first time a former Brazilian president has been tried on coup charges. Bolsonaro now faces the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence for charges including leading a criminal organization and attempting to violently overthrow democratic order.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as the UK's ambassador to the United States following the emergence of new information about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The decision was made after emails revealed Mandelson sent supportive messages to Epstein in 2008 as he faced charges for sex offenses. The government stated that the full depth of the relationship was not known at the time of his appointment. The sacking has prompted criticism from opposition parties and some Labour MPs, raising questions about the initial vetting process.</p>

          <p>In response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump expressed his devastation and stated his belief that "the country will heal." In a call with CNBC, Trump praised Kirk for his role in the 2024 election victory and suggested he could have one day become president. The president emphasized his focus on leading the country to success as a means for national unity in the wake of the tragedy. His comments come as law enforcement continues a nationwide search for the shooter, who remains at large after the targeted killing at a Utah university event.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," from being used in cookware, food packaging, and other consumer products. The proposal has created a conflict between environmental advocates, including actor Mark Ruffalo, and a coalition of celebrity chefs and cookware manufacturers. Proponents of the ban cite significant public health risks linked to PFAS exposure, such as cancer and liver damage. Opponents argue that the specific type of PFAS used in nonstick coatings, like Teflon, is inert, safe when used correctly, and has been approved by regulators like the FDA.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has intensified concerns across the United States about the escalating cycle of political violence. This article analyzes the public reaction, distinguishing between calls for de-escalation and rhetoric that frames political differences as warfare. It explores the idea that while a small, vocal minority on social media may call for conflict, the vast majority of Americans likely desire peace and stability over civil strife. The event serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of dehumanizing political opponents in a highly polarized and media-saturated environment, where such acts can be amplified and potentially inspire further violence.</p>

These increases are driven by higher prices for hospital services and expensive prescription drugs, particularly new treatments for cancer and obesity.

As the co-founder of Turning Point USA, Kirk built a significant movement focused on establishing conservative groups on university campuses across the country. He became a prominent media personality and culture warrior, championing key MAGA policy positions on immigration, firearms, and LGBTQ rights. His influence was credited with helping mobilize young voters, particularly young men, in support of Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, making his death a major shock to the American political landscape.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena resident from Tunisia has shared his story of being detained for 13 days in a notoriously harsh downtown Los Angeles ICE processing center, known as B-18. Despite having a pending green card application through his marriage to a U.S. citizen, he was held in severely cold, overcrowded conditions with inadequate food and no bedding. His experience, which included losing 15 pounds and fainting from health complications, appears to violate a legal settlement limiting detention in the facility to 12 hours. His case has drawn attention from members of Congress and sheds light on the severe conditions within some immigration holding centers.</p>

          <p>The race for the next deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is now a two-person contest between Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell. The third candidate, Bell Riberio-Addy, failed to secure the required number of nominations from fellow Members of Parliament to advance. Phillipson has emerged as the frontrunner among MPs, while Powell is positioning herself as a unifying figure for different factions of the party. The winner, who will be chosen by a ballot of party members in October, will play a crucial role as a link between the membership and the party's leadership.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Warn Trump's Threats to Revoke Citizenship are Becoming More Credible</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump's repeated public threats to revoke the citizenship of political opponents are raising alarms among legal experts, who see a shift from a narrow legal process to a tool of political intimidation. While birthright citizenship is protected by the Supreme Court, the Trump administration's Justice Department has issued memos prioritizing denaturalization proceedings for naturalized citizens under broad categories. Experts argue this approach is unprecedented and potentially unconstitutional, creating a chilling effect that could discourage naturalized citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights for fear of reprisal.</p>

          <p>With inflation remaining elevated, this article offers guidance to seniors considering annuities to protect their retirement income. It warns that traditional fixed annuities, while providing a steady payment, can see their purchasing power significantly eroded over time by rising costs. As alternatives, variable and indexed annuities are presented as potential hedges against inflation, though they come with greater market risk and complexity. The article also discusses inflation protection riders, which can increase annuity payments annually but typically require a lower initial payout, highlighting the trade-offs retirees must consider.

          <p>A significant shift has occurred in the composition of Elon Musk's wealth, with the majority now derived from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI, rather than his publicly traded company, Tesla. This change was highlighted in a recent Tesla proxy filing arguing for a new, massive pay package to keep Musk focused on the automaker. With SpaceX's valuation potentially reaching $400 billion and xAI's nearing $200 billion, Musk's stakes in these private ventures are now worth nearly twice his current Tesla holdings. This financial reality underscores the competing interests and demands on his time across his expansive business empire. (not investment advice)</p>

Discovery surged more than 25% following reports that Paramount, recently acquired by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital, is preparing a cash bid to buy the media conglomerate.

The potential takeover comes as Warner Bros. Discovery is in the process of spinning off its cable networks, a plan that could be altered by a full acquisition of the entire company.</p>

          <p>Hyundai's CEO has confirmed that the recent large-scale immigration raid at its Georgia battery plant will delay the facility's construction by at least two to three months. The enforcement action, which resulted in the detention of hundreds of workers, has created a significant labor shortage that the company must now address. The CEO noted that finding replacements for the specialized positions will be challenging, as many of the required workers are not in the U.S. The delay impacts a major economic project for Georgia and highlights the operational risks companies face from shifting immigration enforcement policies.</p>
