          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 victory against the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the eight-try rout in Adelaide. While the on-field performance was strong, the Lions faced setbacks with a suspected head injury to Garry Ringrose and a knee injury to Luke Cowan Dickie, which saw him stretchered off the field. The dominant win provides momentum but also raises injury concerns for the team ahead of their crucial upcoming game.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Weighing New Military Funding for Ukraine</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering the authorization of new funding for Ukraine's defense, a potential policy shift since he took office. According to diplomatic sources, this move could be a strategic message to Russia following its recent intensified drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. The administration has multiple avenues for this aid, including $3.85 billion in leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize about $5 billion in frozen Russian assets. This consideration comes amid Trump's vocal criticism of past spending levels and his simultaneous push for European NATO allies to increase their financial support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Details How Desi Arnaz Confronted Alcoholism with His Son's Support</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 08:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography, "Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television," reveals that the 'I Love Lucy' star sought help for his alcoholism late in life after a plea to his son, Desi Jr. Feeling isolated and fearing for his life, Arnaz entered a rehabilitation program in 1985, a decision his daughter Lucie Arnaz called the proudest moment of her life. The book by Todd S. Purdum explores how Arnaz's struggles with alcohol and womanizing, stemming partly from the trauma of fleeing Cuba, contributed to the end of his marriage to Lucille Ball. Despite their divorce, the two remained deeply connected until his death from lung cancer in 1986.</p>

          <p>Josh Earnest, who served as White House press secretary under President Obama, recently described the day after Donald Trump's 2016 election victory as his most challenging on the job. Speaking at a journalism conference, Earnest recalled the administration's difficult task of affirming a peaceful transfer of power while simultaneously upholding intelligence assessments of Russian interference. He shared a poignant memory of the visibly demoralized communications staff being called into the Oval Office, where Obama delivered an early version of his unity speech. Earnest reflected on the emotional and complex atmosphere of that period in the White House.</p>

          <p>Researchers are expressing concern that political and regulatory actions against COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could negatively impact promising cancer research. Groundbreaking therapeutic mRNA vaccines for treating diseases like pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma are showing significant potential in clinical trials. However, recent moves by the Trump administration, including cutting NIH funding, restricting vaccine access, and canceling contracts for mRNA bird flu vaccines, have created an environment of uncertainty. Scientists worry this "scorched-earth mentality" could stall critical progress and discourage new projects, potentially delaying transformative treatments for cancer and other chronic diseases.</p>

          <p>One year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned the first-ever rock samples from the far side of the moon, a scientific debate is raging over their age. A Chinese-led study determined the samples from the South Pole-Aitken basin to be 4.25 billion years old, offering direct evidence that challenges existing models for dating lunar surfaces. However, these findings were reportedly rejected twice for peer review by a prominent Western-dominated journal panel. This has highlighted ongoing tensions and differing methodologies within the international planetary science community regarding the interpretation of this unique lunar data.</p>

          <p>After experiencing chest pains, 13-year-old Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition causing severe heart failure that affects only about 300 families globally.

Following his successful transplant, Micah and his mother discovered a lack of support systems for teenagers facing similar health crises.

          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's natural inclination for free, unstructured movement, to their detriment. With rising sedentary behavior and limited access to safe, open spaces, children are missing out on crucial physical and cognitive development. Experts suggest that activities like climbing trees and wrestling help build a robust "movement vocabulary," which improves coordination and reduces injury risk later in life. The author encourages parents to overcome fears of minor injuries and provide opportunities for such play, emphasizing that it fosters healthier bones, better grades, and improved mental well-being.</p>

          <p>Immigrants in Florida are altering their driving behaviors out of fear since state law enforcement gained authority to detain individuals based on immigration status during traffic stops. Many now follow unwritten rules such as avoiding Spanish-language music or stickers, not wearing work uniforms in the car, and refraining from driving certain work vans to avoid being targeted. This climate of fear has reportedly led to significant workforce disruptions, with dozens of workers not showing up to job sites.

This move has drawn sharp criticism from the SPD, which accused the conservatives of deliberately undermining the nation's highest court.

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the pressure to maintain an "acceptable feminine appearance" acts as an insidious financial drain on women. She describes the recurring expenses for hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," where spending on these depreciating assets requires continuous investment just to maintain results. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their financial impact and then experiment with cutting back. The goal is to redirect this money toward building wealth through paying off debt, saving, or investing for the future.</p>

This trend is partly driven by the rise of artificial intelligence, which has increased demand for creative thinking and soft skills often cultivated in the humanities.

The sale is part of his scheduled financial planning and not indicative of a lack of confidence in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the backlash, supporters and politicians have pointed out that Superman, an alien refugee from Krypton, has always been an immigrant. This article argues that while the character's story is one of assimilation, it has rarely delved deeply into the complex political realities faced by many immigrants in the U.S.</p>

County shows a significant increase in owner-surrendered dogs at some shelters, straining a system already at its breaking point.

The new government plan aims to reduce the projected death toll from a major Nankai Trough quake by 80% over the next decade.

The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau reveals that cockpit voice recordings captured one of the pilots asking the other why the fuel was cut off, with the other denying he had done so. The fuel control switches, which are not meant to be moved during takeoff, were found to have shifted to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines. A final, more detailed report is expected within a year as authorities continue to investigate.</p>
