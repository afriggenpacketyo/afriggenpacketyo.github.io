          <h2>Global Bond Yields Plummet Amid Investor Flight to Safety Due to Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Global bond yields are experiencing a sharp decline as investors seek safe-haven assets amid a significant equity sell-off triggered by President Trump's recent tariff announcements. Germany's 10-year bund yield has decreased, indicating increased demand for government debt, and U.S. Treasury yields have also fallen, with the 2-year yield hitting its lowest level since September 2022. Analysts suggest that while a reversal of the tariff policy might temporarily alleviate market panic, it is unlikely to prevent an economic slowdown due to the unpredictability of the current policy environment. Investors are increasingly pricing in the chance of a recession as they navigate an uncertain and volatile market landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears of an economic slowdown spurred by President Trump's tariffs, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen back above 4%. This increase occurs as traders anticipate potential Federal Reserve rate cuts in response to a weakening economy. Trump has consistently advocated for lower Treasury yields to reduce borrowing costs, reiterating this desire even amidst market volatility. However, the tariffs, which have triggered retaliatory measures from major trading partners like China and the EU, continue to fuel concerns about a global trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with many anticipating a recession, rising prices, and potential job losses. A majority of CEOs (69%) expect a recession, with over half predicting it will occur this year, and over a third (37%) anticipate cutting jobs. The tariffs are expected to drive up prices by 5% to 20%, leading to "resurgent inflation." CEOs also expressed concerns about potential boycotts of American brands and anti-American sentiment in overseas markets, highlighting the uncertainty and economic pessimism pervading the corporate outlook.</p>

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro stated that Vietnam's offer to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports is not enough to warrant lifting the tariffs announced the previous week. Navarro cited concerns about non-tariff cheating, including Chinese products being routed through Vietnam, intellectual property theft, and value-added taxes. These comments highlight the Trump administration's focus on broader trade practices beyond just tariffs, signaling a potentially complex and challenging path for trade negotiations with various countries. The administration argues that the value-added tax, a system used by many countries, acts as a trade barrier, a stance not widely accepted.</p>

          <p>Experts express concern that the Trump administration's cuts to federal health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), could halt critical Alzheimer's research. Programs like the Healthy Brain Initiative and BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's are already experiencing staff reductions, potentially impacting treatment options and the lives of patients and their families. Reduced research funding could delay the development of treatments that could delay or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms. While some remain optimistic about continued support for Alzheimer's research, the long-term impacts of the cuts remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Home equity loans and HELOCs provide homeowners with access to funds using their home equity as collateral, often at competitive interest rates. Getting quotes from different lenders, choosing the right loan term, and improving one's credit score can help secure the best rate. While rates fluctuate in response to federal funds rate adjustments, home equity products typically offer better rates than other financing options. With careful research and planning, homeowners can leverage their equity to access cash while optimizing their borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Understanding the dynamics of the gold market is crucial for investors considering gold as a store of value, portfolio diversifier, or speculative investment.

Democrats called for a reversal of Trump's tariffs, emphasizing the need to address rising prices and prevent an economic crash.

          <p>Experts are criticizing the Trump administration's decision to shutter or downsize several federal programs and research institutions focused on preventing violence. Cuts to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are expected to disrupt critical research and potentially lead to an increase in violence. Advocates argue that these cuts undermine efforts to prevent gun violence, sexual violence, domestic terrorist attacks, and violent hate crimes. The move has sparked legal action from attorneys general and officials from 23 states.</p>
