          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "stupid" and doubting the Fed would cut interest rates. Trump asserted that interest rates should be significantly lower and accused Powell of costing the country a fortune, while suggesting Powell dislikes him personally. These remarks came just hours before the Federal Open Market Committee's announcement on interest rates and economic forecasts. Powell and the Fed have maintained their independence, citing economic uncertainties and the impact of tariffs as reasons for caution in adjusting rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld a Tennessee law that bans certain gender-affirming care treatments for minors, marking the first time the justices have ruled on an anti-trans state law. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, stated that the law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee, leaving policy decisions to elected representatives. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing the decision invites discrimination and authorizes harm to transgender children and their families. ACLU attorney Chase Strangio called the decision a devastating loss but emphasized continued efforts to defend transgender rights and equality.</p>

          <p>A British woman, Yvonne Ford, died from rabies after being scratched by a stray puppy during a holiday in Morocco in February. Ford's family reported that she initially did not think much of the incident, but developed severe symptoms, including headaches and loss of motor skills, weeks later. The UK Health Security Agency has stated that there is no risk to the wider public, as rabies is not typically transmitted between people. Close contacts and healthcare workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precautionary measure following this tragic incident.</p>

          <p>The opening of the HS2 high-speed railway line in the UK will be delayed beyond the target date of 2033, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, who cited "appalling mess" and wasted taxpayer money. Alexander attributed the delays to constant scope changes, ineffective contracts, and mismanagement, with costs ballooning by Â£37 billion since the project's approval in 2012. An interim report highlighted a lack of timely intervention to address known challenges and construction starting too soon without stable designs. Mike Brown, former commissioner of Transport for London, has been appointed as the new chair of HS2.</p>

          <p>Authorities have released new images showing how Travis Decker, the suspect in the deaths of his three young daughters in Washington state, may have altered his appearance. Decker, a former soldier with survival skills, is wanted since failing to return the girls after a custody visit. The images depict Decker with a shaved head, different facial hair styles, and longer hair, as the search continues.

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" if it intervenes militarily in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel.

This follows escalating tensions and missile fire between Israel and Iran, with the International Atomic Energy Agency reporting that two nuclear centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit.

          <p>The article explores why straight men are often perceived as being bad at gossiping, attributing it to a lack of cultural opportunities to freely engage in social storytelling. Studies suggest that men do gossip but may avoid openly partaking due to social stigmas and fears of appearing "messy." This reticence can contribute to the male loneliness epidemic, as sharing stories and engaging in social conversation is crucial for building intimacy and close friendships. The article suggests that men could benefit from embracing gossip as a social tool to strengthen connections.</p>

President Trump had previously blamed Iran for not engaging fully in talks with the US on a new deal that would place strict curbs on its nuclear programme.
