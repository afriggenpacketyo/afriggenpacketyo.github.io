          <p>GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy are being considered for microdosing, with some doctors, including Dr. Terry Dubrow, suggesting low daily doses for general health beyond diabetes and weight loss. Proponents highlight benefits like blood sugar regulation and reduced heart disease risk, while acknowledging ongoing research and unknowns. However, drug manufacturers explicitly warn against off-label microdosing due to potential safety risks and lack of data. This article explores the growing trend and the differing views on its widespread adoption.</p>

This move reflects the EU's commitment to pressing Moscow while navigating complex international diplomatic relationships. The discussions could impact global trade rules.</p>

          <p>Approximately 22 million Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans could face an average 75% increase in their insurance premiums if enhanced federal subsidies expire after 2025. These subsidies, initially part of pandemic relief and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, have significantly lowered costs and contributed to record-low uninsured rates. The potential "subsidy cliff" would add over $700 annually to average premiums, with political debate ongoing in Congress regarding a possible extension. This article highlights a critical policy decision impacting health coverage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume in the United States saw a significant 9.2% increase last week, reaching its highest level in three years. This surge was primarily driven by a sharp drop in the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate, which decreased to 6.49% from 6.64%, marking the lowest rate since October 2024. Both purchase and refinance applications rose, indicating renewed borrower confidence and activity in the housing market. Economists attribute the rate decline to data suggesting a weakening labor market.</p>

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, Istanbul's former mayor and a prominent opposition figure, faces multiple charges, including forgery, which could lead to his exclusion from future presidential elections. His university diploma has been annulled, a move his party claims is politically motivated by the ruling Justice and Development (AK) party. Imamoglu is also accused of corruption and supporting terrorism, stemming from his party's cooperation with a pro-Kurdish party. Critics view these proceedings as government retaliation against a popular rival.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is now home to the first onshore wave power project in the United States, launched by Swedish company Eco Wave Power. The pilot project uses bobbing steel floaters to harness ocean energy, generating 100 kilowatts of clean electricity, enough for about 100 homes. This innovative technology keeps expensive components on land, avoiding marine disruption and offering 24/7 power, unlike some other renewables. The project aims to scale up to 60 megawatts, contributing to ambitious climate goals and port decarbonization efforts.</p>

          <p>This article critically examines the rise and influence of originalism in American jurisprudence, particularly through Justice Antonin Scalia's advocacy, arguing it has fundamentally altered constitutional interpretation. It contends that originalism, coupled with the increasing difficulty of formally amending the Constitution, has led to the politicization of Supreme Court nominations and a perceived undermining of the document's adaptability. The piece highlights how this approach has contributed to deep partisan divisions and a crisis of legitimacy for the Court, where historical coherence is often sacrificed for preferred outcomes.</p>
