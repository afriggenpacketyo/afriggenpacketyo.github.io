          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 12:13:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance clarifying the implications of a recent UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' as biological terms within the 2010 Equality Act. This means organizations can exclude transgender women from women-only spaces, but the EHRC stresses that transgender people should not be left without any facilities to use. The guidance suggests providing mixed-sex facilities where possible, and in schools, trans pupils should use alternative provisions, not the toilets or changing rooms aligning with their identified gender. A consultation is planned to seek feedback before the EHRC submits an updated code of practice to the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A special tribunal is being planned to prosecute Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, but faces significant obstacles, including the immunity of sitting heads of state like Vladimir Putin. While investigations are underway targeting high-ranking Russian officials, no arrest warrants can be issued unless their immunity is lifted. The tribunal's jurisdiction period is also debated, with some arguing it should include events from 2014, not just the full-scale invasion in 2022, in order to account for the initial annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in eastern Ukraine. The political will for the tribunal is also uncertain, with potential shifts in support from the US and varying reactions from countries maintaining ties with Russia.</p>

Only 24% believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities, and his approval ratings on the economy and foreign policy are low. Even among Republicans, support is not overwhelming, and independent voters express significant concerns. These negative reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, suggesting voter fatigue after a period of market volatility and increased deportations.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, known as the "Godfather of AI," expresses increasing concern about the rapid development of artificial intelligence. Despite recognizing AI's potential benefits in various fields, Hinton estimates a 10% to 20% risk that AI will eventually take control from humans. He criticizes major AI companies for prioritizing profits over safety and advocates for significantly more resources to be dedicated to AI safety research. Hinton's concerns echo those of other industry leaders, highlighting the need for caution and responsible development in the field of AI.</p>

The Education Department is arguing that the ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals required it to end the loan forgiveness under repayment plans beyond SAVE. As a result, the Pay As You Earn and Income-Contingent Repayment options no longer wipe debt away after a certain number of years.
