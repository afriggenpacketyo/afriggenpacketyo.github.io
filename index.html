          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles following protests against ICE operations. President Trump criticized California's Governor Newsom and Los Angeles' Mayor Bass, claiming the federal government will intervene due to their inability to manage the situation. Newsom responded by calling the deployment "purposefully inflammatory" and stating that local authorities can handle the situation. The deployment raises questions about federal overreach and potential escalation of tensions, especially given the history of tensions between the federal government and the state of California.</p>

          <p>Two sisters from Pontardawe, Wales, recount the emotional distress caused by their mother's conviction for stealing their Â£50,000 inheritance. Katherine Hill and her father were found guilty of fraud after draining the trust fund left to Gemma and Jessica Thomas by their grandmother. The sisters described their mother as once being their best friend, making the betrayal even more painful and leading to feelings of anxiety and distrust. The stolen money, now worth approximately Â£65,000 due to inflation, was meant to be accessed when they turned 25, but was instead used to fund Hill's lifestyle.</p>

Critics argue that this policy is redundant, expensive, and perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power status.

          <p>Israel is facing accusations of war crimes in Gaza, raising concerns about the conduct of the war and the protection of civilians. The International Committee of the Red Cross believes Israel is flouting the Geneva Conventions, potentially undermining the rules of war globally. A British government minister stated that Israel was using hunger as a weapon of war, while others accuse Netanyahu of prolonging the conflict for personal gain. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other leaders.</p>
