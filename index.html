          <p>A 22-year-old man, Raymond Boodarian, has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of residential burglary for the killings of 'American Idol' music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was found shot multiple times in their Encino home on July 14 after returning from a grocery trip. Investigators used security footage and facial recognition to identify the suspect, who allegedly entered the home through an unlocked door, leading to a fatal confrontation. The case has highlighted community concerns about home security, as the couple had recently sought security services after a previous break-in.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing him of overseeing an "ostentatious" and potentially unlawful office renovation. This new line of attack comes amid President Trump's ongoing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. Powell has defended the project, stating that descriptions of lavish features like rooftop gardens and private elevators are inaccurate and that the renovations are necessary for the aging buildings. The conflict underscores the tension between the White House's economic demands and the central bank's traditional independence.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of "wet reckless driving" following a DUI citation in 2024. The former USC star was found asleep at the wheel of his Rolls-Royce near Los Angeles International Airport. By accepting the plea deal, Addison avoids potential jail time and will instead serve 12 months of probation, pay a fine, and complete online courses. The NFL has stated that the incident remains under review, and Addison could still face a suspension under the league's substance abuse policy.</p>

          <p>Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil renowned for his record-breaking 2012 free fall from the stratosphere, has died at age 56 in a paragliding accident. He was reportedly flying a motorized paraglider in Porto Sant'Elpidio, Italy, when he suffered a sudden illness and crashed into a hotel pool. Baumgartner became a global icon after he became the first person to break the sound barrier in a free fall, jumping from an altitude of nearly 128,000 feet.

          <p>President Trump is facing mounting pressure from both Democrats and his own supporters to release all Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Despite widespread public interest and bipartisan calls for transparency, the administration has resisted, with Trump labeling the controversy a "hoax" and insulting Republicans who are pushing for the release. The issue gained prominence after Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments about an alleged client list, which she later retracted. This defiance has created a political rift, putting the White House at odds with a significant portion of its base and fueling further speculation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noticing mild swelling in his legs, according to his physician. The White House described the condition as "benign" and common for his age group. CVI is a circulatory issue where damaged valves in leg veins hinder blood flow back to the heart, causing blood to pool. While most cases are mild and managed with compression stockings and exercise, the diagnosis required an ultrasound to rule out more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. The president is reported to be in otherwise "excellent health."</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the executive branch acted unlawfully by shutting down the FEMA-managed program, which provides federal funds for pre-disaster mitigation projects like flood control and building elevation. The states argue that this decision, which they claim is the purview of Congress, jeopardizes critical infrastructure projects and leaves communities at higher risk from natural disasters.

Critics argue that this approach undermines transparency and accountability, creating a perception that the conservative majority is making politically motivated decisions rather than acting on clear legal principles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon is continuing its workforce reduction with a new round of layoffs, this time affecting some employees in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing unit. The company stated the cuts are part of an ongoing effort to review its organization and refocus on key priorities, rather than being primarily driven by AI investments. While the exact number of affected employees was not disclosed, the move follows a period of slowing revenue growth for AWS. This adds to the more than 27,000 jobs Amazon has eliminated since 2022 as part of a broader cost-cutting initiative under CEO Andy Jassy.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has formally responded to the Trump administration's accusations regarding cost overruns for the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. In a letter to the OMB Director, Powell detailed the necessity of the project, citing significant structural repairs, hazardous material removal, and the replacement of antiquated systems. He refuted claims of "ostentatious" features, clarifying that the work is essential for safety and efficiency. This exchange highlights the ongoing pressure from the White House, which has used the renovation project as another point of criticism against Powell amid calls for interest rate cuts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth minerals to China increased threefold, while China's overall imports of these strategic materials hit a record high. This trade shift is seen by analysts as a consequence of the ongoing trade friction between Washington and Beijing. As the U.S. and China impose trade barriers on each other, global supply chains appear to be rerouting through emerging economies like Brazil. The trend reflects China's strategy to diversify its access to critical minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing, while also highlighting the ripple effects of global geopolitical tensions on international commerce.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that his country "deeply regrets" that a stray munition struck Gaza's only Catholic Church, killing three people who were sheltering inside. The Israeli military said an initial inquiry suggests fragments from a shell fired during operational activity hit the church by mistake. The incident at the Holy Family Church in Gaza City also left several people injured and drew condemnation from Pope Leo XIV, who renewed his call for a ceasefire. The White House reported that President Trump did not have a "positive reaction" to the news of the attack.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump would not recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case. This statement comes as the president faces criticism from his own base for his administration's handling of the matter and his dismissal of the controversy as a "hoax." Despite calls for greater transparency from figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson, the administration is holding its position. The refusal to support a special prosecutor further deepens the political divide over the case and the demand for the public release of all related government files.</p>

          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are threatening to redraw the state's congressional districts in a controversial effort to gain more seats for their party. The move is a direct response to a Republican plan in Texas to redraw its maps to favor the GOP at the request of Donald Trump. However, California's plan faces significant legal hurdles, as the state's redistricting power was given to an independent commission by voters over a decade ago. Critics argue that circumventing this process would undermine democracy, even if it is framed as a hardball tactic to counter Republican maneuvers.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating analyst expectations with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase to $11.08 billion. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy member growth, advertising sales, and favorable currency exchange rates. This is the second quarter that Netflix has not released specific subscriber numbers, instead focusing on financial metrics like its operating margin, which improved to 34.1%. Despite the positive results, the company warned that margins would be lower in the second half of the year due to a larger slate of content releases.</p>

Bove's nomination is highly controversial due to his close ties to the president and his role in aggressive Justice Department actions. His confirmation is opposed by hundreds of former DOJ lawyers and retired judges who fear his loyalty to Trump would compromise his judicial impartiality.</p>

          <p>The UK government has revealed a major data breach that compromised the personal information of over 100 British officials, including members of SAS special forces and MI6 intelligence. The leak also exposed the data of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for resettlement after working with British forces, placing them at severe risk of reprisal from the Taliban. The breach occurred when a UK Special Forces headquarters employee inadvertently emailed a massive database of applications to an individual outside the government. The incident has been called a "serious departmental error" and has led to a costly, covert resettlement operation.</p>
