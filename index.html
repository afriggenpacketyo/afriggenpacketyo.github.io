          <p>As the new school year begins in Los Angeles, undocumented families are experiencing significant fear and uncertainty due to a recent increase in immigration enforcement activities. Some parents are hesitant to send their children to school, fearing separation, while others are creating emergency plans in case of detention and deportation. In response, the Los Angeles Unified School District has established "safe zones" around 100 schools to monitor federal activity and protect families. This initiative comes after several high-profile incidents, including the mistaken detention of a student, prompting concern from city officials and community advocates.</p>

The clashes are the latest escalation in months of student-led demonstrations, which were initially sparked by a deadly infrastructure collapse blamed on corruption. Protesters are now demanding an early election, accusing President Aleksandar Vucic's government of fostering authoritarianism and corruption. The ongoing unrest has drawn concern from the European Union and United Nations human rights experts over the government's repressive response to dissent.</p>

          <p>Free agent wide receiver Isaiah Bond is set to sign with the Cleveland Browns after a grand jury in Collin County, Texas, declined to indict him in a sexual assault case. The "no bill" decision concludes the criminal proceedings against Bond, who had maintained his innocence since the allegations arose. Bond, who went undrafted after turning himself in to police in April, expressed gratitude to the Browns for the opportunity to continue his NFL career. He stated he will learn from the experience while reaffirming his innocence but will not discuss case details on his attorney's advice.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy demonstrated surprising resilience by expanding 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, outperforming economists' forecasts despite trade pressures from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by strong net exports, which helped offset the impact of a 15% blanket tariff on all U.S.-bound exports. On an annualized basis, the country's GDP grew 1%, also beating expectations. However, the Bank of Japan remains cautious, warning that global trade policies could lead to a slowdown in overseas economies and affect domestic corporate profits in the future.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan to hold a special election to redraw the state's congressional districts, a direct countermove to a Republican effort in Texas to create more GOP-favorable seats. Newsom framed the action as a necessary response to what he called an attempt by former President Trump to "rig the system" ahead of the midterm elections. The plan, which requires amending the state constitution and voter approval, aims to potentially create five new Democratic-leaning districts to offset Republican gains in Texas. This escalates a partisan national battle over redistricting that could significantly impact control of Congress.</p>

The meeting follows virtual discussions between Trump and European leaders, who expressed concerns about being sidelined but received assurances that the U.S. would prioritize a deal protecting Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is seeking security guarantees as part of any potential peace agreement. While the summit is viewed as a critical opportunity for diplomacy, many Ukrainians remain skeptical about achieving a meaningful breakthrough.</p>

          <p>The city of Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decline after the collapse of its steel industry, is undergoing a steady economic revitalization. Local entrepreneurs are breathing new life into the city by transforming abandoned factories and mills into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market. This grassroots effort is contributing to a stabilized population and an unemployment rate that is now only slightly above the national average. The city's comeback is not characterized by a single major project but by a resilient, incremental process of forging a new identity beyond its steel-producing history.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the popular online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of prioritizing profits over child safety. The suit, brought by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox has not implemented adequate safety measures, creating an environment where sexual predators can victimize children. This legal action follows similar lawsuits and criticism against the company for its safety protocols, despite Roblox's stated zero-tolerance policy for child exploitation. The lawsuit argues that the platform's lack of a robust age verification process endangers its vast user base of over 111 million monthly players.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. Many respondents view this trend unfavorably, often seeing it as an additional cost rather than a way to show appreciation for service. The perception of increased tipping pressure may be linked to broader concerns about rising prices and the overall cost of living. The survey highlights a shift in public sentiment regarding gratuity, reflecting economic anxieties that have been prevalent across various income levels.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers associated with traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. This campaign addresses growing concerns over "medical tourism," where individuals seek cheaper procedures like hair implants or dental work overseas, sometimes with devastating results. The initiative will feature content creators urging their followers to consult with UK doctors, secure proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgical procedures. The goal is to protect patients from life-altering injuries and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched overseas treatments.</p>

The man ran from the site onto the freeway, where he was hit by a vehicle and later died at a hospital. This death follows a similar incident in July where another man died while fleeing a raid, raising further concerns among advocates about the consequences of such enforcement tactics.</p>

Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative imperative, stated the change was necessary due to declining business, particularly in private event bookings and high-end wine sales. Humm acknowledged that the all-in vegan approach was excluding potential customers and that it was difficult to fill the restaurant for corporate dinners. The reversal highlights the significant commercial challenges of high-end, plant-based dining, even for one of the world's most renowned culinary establishments.</p>

While Netanyahu maintains a message of total victory, significant portions of the Israeli public, especially families of hostages, are demanding a ceasefire deal to secure their release. Conversely, far-right members of his coalition are pushing for a more aggressive stance, including the annexation of Gaza. Opinion polls show a stark divide in how Jewish and Arab Israelis view the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, reflecting a society torn by trauma, political survival, and competing visions for the nation's future.</p>

For Trump, the summit is an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of being a global peacemaker, potentially securing a Nobel Peace Prize.

Former officials note that Putin often dominates conversations with lengthy monologues, while Trump is more prone to freewheeling statements.

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has reached an agreement to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth in a deal that could be worth a club-record £42.5 million. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London after expressing a desire to leave Bournemouth, where he had a less prominent role. Ouattara made a significant impact last season, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances for the Cherries. The move signals Brentford's ambition in the transfer market, having previously shown interest in other high-value players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The historical trauma of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre remains a significant point of contention in modern China-Japan relations, fueled by differing national memories of World War Two. In China, the event is a symbol of brutal occupation, with its memory amplified by a wave of patriotic films and media. This contrasts with Japan, where the war is often viewed through the lens of its own victimhood, and public discussion of atrocities like the massacre is limited. This enduring "history war" is exacerbated by what many in China see as Japan's failure to fully apologize for its wartime actions, creating persistent animosity and hindering true reconciliation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department will seek the death penalty against Teresa Youngblut, a 21-year-old woman accused of murdering a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont. A grand jury indicted Youngblut for the January shooting of Agent David Maland during a traffic stop, which also resulted in the death of her companion. Youngblut and her companion had been under surveillance after being reported for wearing tactical gear. Authorities have reportedly linked the incident to the Zizians, a cult-like group associated with several deaths across three states, adding a complex dimension to the capital case.</p>

The judge stated the guidance initiated a "sea change" in regulation, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful speech and activities.
