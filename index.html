Her husband resigned from the Senate weeks after being found guilty of accepting lavish bribes and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.

            <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, focusing on the legal rights of migrants.

The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations under this act, underscoring the legal complexities and human rights implications of the administration's immigration policies.</p>

            <p>With credit card debt hitting record highs and interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating debt into a lower-rate loan can be an effective way to get ahead.

However, the effectiveness depends on credit profile; those with good to excellent credit may qualify for the lowest consolidation loan rates. It's crucial to assess your financial situation and compare loan offers to ensure the new loan's interest rate is lower than the weighted average of current debts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Salesforce shares experienced a decline following an analyst downgrade by D.A. Davidson, citing concerns that the company is prematurely focusing on AI with its Agentforce offering at the expense of its core business. Despite acknowledging the long-term importance of AI, analysts believe this strategy could negatively impact past acquisitions like Slack and MuleSoft. While the Club maintains a longer-term view on Salesforce's potential, the stock has faced challenges this year due to market uncertainties and executive turnover. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tesla shares fell nearly 6% ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report, driven by concerns about "ongoing brand erosion." CEO Elon Musk's activities outside of Tesla, especially his role within the Trump administration, are in focus, along with progress on robotaxi and self-driving technology. Boycotts and criminal activity targeting Tesla vehicles and facilities have also contributed to the stock's decline. Tesla reported a 13% decline in vehicle deliveries compared to the same period last year.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effectively shuttered the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, firing 130 federal mediators. This has raised concerns among unions and employers about resolving labor disputes, as the agency played a vital role in brokering negotiations and preventing labor unrest. A lawsuit has been filed by major unions against the Trump administration to reverse the closure. The dismantling of the agency is expected to create inefficiencies and prolong labor disputes.</p>
