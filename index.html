          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is experiencing significant internal turmoil following a shooting at its Atlanta headquarters, which killed a police officer. Staff are reporting harassment and grappling with over 600 job cuts that have dismantled key public health programs, including HIV prevention and violence surveys. Further compounding unease, the CDC announced a new panel, chaired by a vocal critic, to review COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which many employees view as a concession to misinformation. The ongoing challenges are straining an institution already under immense pressure.</p>

Additionally, Meta will launch a companion wristband utilizing CTRL Labs technology, allowing users to control the glasses with hand gestures.

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly close to finalizing new media rights deals with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming for comprehensive, non-redundant coverage. NBC is expected to acquire Sunday night games and wild-card playoffs for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix secures Home Run Derby rights for $50 million. ESPN will receive a new $550 million package, including MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams, alongside a midweek national game package. These three-year agreements, expiring after the 2028 season, mark new partnerships to boost reach and revenue for the league. (not investment advice)</p>

HHS officials confirmed ending union recognition and reclaiming union office space, a move unions deem illegal. This action aligns with broader Trump administration efforts to curtail federal employee union powers, previously seen at the VA and EPA. The department stated the change ensures resources focus on public health, but unions argue strong contracts support a stable, experienced workforce.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) achieved a new record high, surpassing its 2021 peak, in response to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments at Jackson Hole. Powell's suggestion that policy adjustments might be warranted, hinting at a September rate cut, triggered significant short liquidations in ETH. This shift indicates renewed momentum in the crypto market, with stablecoins and institutional interest boosting Ethereum's prominence. Shares of ether-focused companies also saw substantial gains, reflecting a broader risk-on sentiment in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a dramatic modernization over the past decade, significantly closing the military capabilities gap with the United States. With ambitious goals set for 2027, 2035, and 2049, China aims for a "world class" military, comparable to the U.S. by its centennial. Analysts note that rapid advances in advanced weapons and industrial support now position China as a comparable military power in the Indo-Pacific. A forthcoming military parade in September is expected to showcase these improvements, signaling a major shift in global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security, but many are unaware of factors that can reduce their benefits. Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, leading to temporary deductions.

Finally, Social Security benefits can be subject to federal income tax if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, surprising many who expect tax-free payments.

This approach, it suggests, is an insult to Black and Indigenous Americans and hinders a proper understanding of current societal issues. The author warns against accepting lies from an authoritarian government and forgetting the past.</p>

          <h2>FBI Searches John Bolton's Home in Investigation into Mishandling of Classified Material</h2>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly raided the Maryland home and office of former National Security Advisor John Bolton as part of an investigation into whether he mishandled or shared classified material. President Trump, who fired Bolton in 2019 and called him a "lowlife," denied knowledge of the raid. The investigation is likely separate from Bolton's past dispute with Trump over his memoir's clearance. Known for his punctilious nature, Bolton has ironically criticized government over-classification. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions between the former advisor and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>California and Texas are embroiled in an intense redistricting battle with significant implications for the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas Republicans initiated the conflict by redrawing maps to create five new Republican-favoring congressional seats mid-decade. California Democrats responded by voting to redraw their own districts to boost Democratic representation by five seats, aiming to neutralize Texas's move. This political "arms race" highlights the practice of gerrymandering and could spread to other states, influencing the upcoming national midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Five police officers were killed in southeastern Iran when unidentified gunmen opened fire on two police patrol vehicles. The attack, which occurred in a region prone to clashes between security forces and armed groups, was later claimed by Jaish ul-Adl militants. Iran's southeast has been a scene of sporadic violence involving Sunni militants and separatists fighting for greater rights.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is signaling a readiness to cut interest rates this fall, leading to a stock market rally, but Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that long-term "neutral" rates may remain higher than in the 2010s. This suggests that borrowing costs, including mortgage rates, may not return to pre-pandemic lows, impacting housing affordability. Powell noted tariffs have begun to push up inflation, and the labor market has become sluggish, creating an unstable balance. Despite the short-term optimism, the article suggests executive policies are destabilizing the economy, limiting the Fed's ability to fully mitigate damage. (not investment advice)</p>

Infrastructure, including munitions storage, is appearing on newly expanded reefs. This development highlights escalating tensions in the South China Sea, where multiple nations have overlapping claims, and China's claims were previously rejected by international law.</p>

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court has issued favorable rulings for bars, allowing them to continue lawsuits seeking compensation from the state for COVID-19 restrictions. Bars argued that former Governor Roy Cooper's executive orders, which shuttered their operations while allowing restaurants to serve alcohol, treated them unfairly. The court's majority rejected arguments for state immunity, asserting that small business owners faced significant uncertainty. This decision means plaintiffs can present evidence that their constitutional right to earn a living was violated, potentially leading to financial damages for the affected establishments.</p>

After struggling to lose weight post-pregnancy despite intense training, Williams turned to GLP-1 drugs, losing 31 pounds in eight months. While she is now a spokesperson for a company selling these drugs, her honesty resonates with many women facing similar struggles. Experts note her admission could challenge stereotypes about drug users but also raises concerns about societal pressure on appearance and potential side effects, despite Williams reporting none.</p>
