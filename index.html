          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 19:01:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly willing to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30 million, despite him being only two years into a five-year contract. This potential sale is linked to the club's interest in signing RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. While Hojlund has publicly stated his desire to stay, his departure could be necessary for the club to comply with Premier League financial regulations, especially if a new forward is acquired. The sale would represent a financial loss for United, as Hojlund's book value is higher than the proposed sale price.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms is signaling a more cautious approach to its open-source AI strategy, which contrasts with China's rapid development in the field. Experts like Andrew Ng suggest China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem is helping it gain ground on the U.S. in AI development. Recently, Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have released advanced open-source models, claiming top performance in global benchmarks. This strategic shift highlights the evolving competitive landscape in AI, with differing philosophies on the benefits of open versus proprietary systems.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv, promising that President Trump's administration would work to secure their release. The meeting occurred amid protests and growing desperation, as recent videos released by Hamas and Islamic Jihad showed hostages in severely poor health. The families are urging the Israeli government to prioritize a deal to free the approximately 20 hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. The situation is set against a backdrop of ongoing violence and a severe humanitarian crisis within the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>An annual cleanup event at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado resulted in the collection of 780 pounds of trash and lost items from the mountain. A team of 150 employees participated in the effort, finding a range of objects including a message in a bottle containing a COVID-19 vaccination card, an iPod Nano, and a hamburger flipper. The resort noted that the most memorable find was a family of moose, highlighting the importance of preserving natural habitats. The initiative also occasionally reunites guests with valuable lost items, such as a previously returned engagement ring.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943 but died during the voyage to England. For decades, it was rumored the animal died from shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent archival research by students at the University of Sydney revealed that the platypus likely died from heatstroke, as logbooks showed water temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for the species.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, has opened an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The Hatch Act limits the political activities of federal employees. It remains unclear what action the OSC could take against Smith, who is no longer a government employee, if a violation is found.</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Gad is expected to perform as King Herod in the final night of "Jesus Christ Superstar" at the Hollywood Bowl after a bout with COVID-19. Gad had initially announced he would have to pull out of the three-night run, with John Stamos stepping in for the first performance. However, after testing negative, Gad confirmed on social media that he would take the stage for the Sunday show. The production, starring Cynthia Erivo and Adam Lambert, has been highly anticipated, and Gad's return adds another dramatic turn to the celebrated musical event.</p>

          <p>Romania is taking steps to formally recognize the genocide of its Sinti and Roma people during World War II, a topic long silenced in the country's public discourse. At a recent commemoration event, Romania's new president and other officials emphasized the need to confront this history and combat ongoing hate speech and racism. During the war, over 25,000 Roma were deported from Romania to Transnistria, where many died from starvation and disease. The recent political shift and public discussions signal a move towards greater historical accountability and inclusion for the Roma community.</p>

          <p>Ethereum is celebrating its tenth anniversary, having evolved from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance. Launched as a "programmable money" platform, it now underpins a $420 billion ecosystem of decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenized assets. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on Ethereum, using it for everything from tokenized funds to stablecoin settlements, which reached $28 trillion last year. While founder Vitalik Buterin warns against centralization risks, the platform's stability has made it the trusted backbone for the next generation of financial products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old Tennessee man, Kevin Wade O'Neal, has been arrested after allegedly threatening to kill public officials and law enforcement personnel. During the arrest at his home in Polk County, deputies discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device. A subsequent search by the ATF and a bomb squad uncovered a total of 14 explosive devices. Investigators believe O'Neal attempted to detonate the explosives as officers arrived to apprehend him. He now faces multiple charges, including nine counts of attempted first-degree murder against the officers present.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Police Federation of England and Wales has criticized a government-backed 4.2% pay rise for officers as "barely treading water." The organization, which represents over 145,000 officers, argued the increase is not enough to combat record resignations and declining living standards after years of real-terms pay cuts. While the home secretary described the award as a "clear signal of our gratitude," the federation stated it would do little to address the ongoing crisis in policing. The pay rise, which is slightly above the current inflation rate, will be partially funded by the Home Office.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to impose a 17% tariff on tomatoes imported from Mexico has been met with approval from some American farmers, who feel the previous trade deal was unfair. Farmers like Chad Smith in Alabama report increased business interest since the announcement, arguing that loopholes in the old agreement allowed Mexican producers to undercut U.S. prices. While the tariff is intended to protect domestic growers, there are concerns it could lead to higher prices for consumers at the grocery store. The move highlights the debate over trade policy's impact on producers and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Precinct DTLA, a well-known gay bar in downtown Los Angeles, has warned it may be forced to close due to a costly legal battle. A former employee, Jessica Gonzales, has filed a lawsuit alleging she faced discrimination and harassment as a heterosexual woman and was fired after reporting an unsafe work environment. The bar's owners have denied the allegations, claiming they are false and are draining the business financially. They also suggested the lawsuit is part of an anti-LGBTQ agenda, pointing to past reports about the plaintiff's lawyer using anti-gay slurs.</p>
