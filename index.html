            <p>Retired PLA Senior Colonel Zhou Bo argues that China's rise and influence are unstoppable, even with potential flashpoints like Taiwan. He highlights that while the US focuses on pressuring allies, China is building a hi-tech global navy to safeguard overseas interests and shoulder international responsibilities. Zhou's essays, compiled in 'Should the World Fear China?', explore China's evolving role on the world stage and address concerns about its growing influence in geopolitics and relations with other nations. The book aims to provide insights into Beijing's perspectives as its global status continues to rise. Optimism score: 65</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's threat of escalating tariffs, promising countermeasures to protect its rights and interests. This response follows Trump's announcement of a potential 50% duty on US imports from China if Beijing doesn't withdraw its 34% tariff on American products. The escalation reflects diminished hopes for a trade deal, with China prepared for a full-blown trade war and considering further retaliatory actions, including export controls and restrictions on US firms operating within China. The People's Bank of China has also weakened the yuan, signaling a readiness to navigate the economic fallout. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concerns about President Trump's tariffs, with 69% expecting a recession, the majority of which believe it will occur this year. CEOs anticipate increased prices and potential job losses, with over a third planning to cut jobs. The uncertainty surrounding trade policy has led to 'war rooming' inflation scenarios, with companies expecting to pass on some tariff costs to consumers. Concerns also rise about potential boycotts of American brands and growing anti-American sentiment, potentially leading to further job cuts and stagflation. Optimism score: 20</p>

This suggests that increased European engagement with China could offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship.

            <p>The Arizona trial of Lori Vallow Daybell, already sentenced to life in prison for killing her children in Idaho, has commenced, focusing on the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Vallow Daybell, representing herself, faces conspiracy to commit murder charges, pleading not guilty. The trial, expected to last until mid-May, will delve into the events surrounding Charles Vallow's death, who was shot by Lori's brother, Alexander Cox, in 2019. The case is complicated by Vallow Daybell's apocalyptic religious beliefs and previous convictions related to the deaths of her children and Chad Daybell's first wife. Optimism score: 40</p>

Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force. Trump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called woke policies are dead. There has been a vigorous campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, and to erase DEI programs and online content. Optimism score: 40</p>
