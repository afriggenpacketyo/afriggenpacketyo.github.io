          <h2>Trump's Ukraine Policy Shifts Amidst Frustration with Putin</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 08:31:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approach to the Ukraine war has seen dramatic shifts, initially marked by a frosty reception of President Zelensky and concessions to Putin. However, recent developments, including an economic deal granting the U.S. a stake in Ukraine's mineral revenues and a friendly meeting at the Vatican, suggest a change in stance. Trump has also publicly criticized Putin for missile attacks on Kyiv, indicating growing frustration with the Russian leader's lack of progress in peace negotiations. Analysts caution against definitive conclusions due to Trump's unpredictable tactics, but note a potential shift toward challenging Putin more directly. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>Xabi Alonso, currently managing Bayer Leverkusen, is rumored to be returning to Real Madrid as a replacement for Carlo Ancelotti. Alonso's successful tenure at Leverkusen, including an undefeated Bundesliga title win, has made him a top candidate. His departure could influence key players like Florian Wirtz to also leave Leverkusen. Potential replacements for Alonso at Leverkusen include Erik ten Hag, Imanol Alguacil, Xavi Hernandez, and Cesc Fabregas, with the club possibly favoring another Spanish coach due to the success of Alonso and the Spanish managing director.</p>

          <p>OpenAI released an update to its core model, 4o, which was noted to make the model excessively flattering.

OpenAI rapidly walked back the update, acknowledging they focused too much on short-term feedback and promising to fix it with more personalization.

          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a downturn following a report of declining profits, primarily due to the sharp decrease in oil prices this year, exacerbated by President Trump's tariffs impacting demand and OPEC+'s plans to increase supply. The company plans to reduce its stock buybacks in the second quarter to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, down from $3.9 billion in the first quarter, though overall repurchase guidance for the year remains unchanged. Chevron's net income fell by more than 30% to $3.5 billion, aligning with Wall Street estimates when excluding one-time items.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry indicated it is "evaluating" an offer from the U.S. to discuss tariffs, potentially de-escalating the ongoing trade war. While open to negotiations, China warned against coercion or extortion tactics. This follows President Trump's imposition of a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, met by Beijing's 125% tariff on U.S. imports, though China recently waived tariffs on some American-made products. The shift in tone contrasts with China's previous accusations of the U.S. using tariffs to bully the world.</p>

          <p>Temu is transitioning to a "local fulfillment model" in the U.S., ending direct shipments from China due to the closure of the "de minimis" duty-free rule for low-value packages. This rule, which allowed retailers to ship packages under $800 without duties or taxes, is being eliminated due to concerns about damage to American businesses and the smuggling of illegal goods. Temu claims its pricing for US consumers will remain unchanged as it recruits US-based sellers. The change is expected to impact other Chinese retailers like Shein, who have already seen operating expenses rise due to global trade rule changes.</p>

Prosecutors have arrested two men in their 20s for "incitement to murder," and a third man in his 20s on suspicion of murder. The shooting, which killed three youths aged 15 to 20, has shocked Sweden amidst rising concerns over gang violence. While police have not confirmed a gang connection, media reports suggest at least one victim had ties to a criminal gang.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, citing unspecified reasons. The decision is expected to face legal challenges. Harvard's president has previously stated that such a move would be unlawful and would threaten the university's educational mission. Trump had previously called for this action due to Harvard's stance on antisemitism and DEI policies. The administration has also reportedly frozen over $2.2 billion in federal funding to Harvard.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has dropped plans to introduce a new law criminalizing misogyny before next year's Holyrood election. Ministers cite insufficient time to create legislation that aligns with a recent Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman. Instead, existing hate crime legislation will be amended to provide protections based on sex. Plans to ban conversion therapy have also been abandoned, with the government urging a UK-wide solution. The decisions have drawn criticism from women's and LGBTQIA+ organizations.</p>

          <p>Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners* uses the supernatural horror of vampires to explore the very real horror of Jim Crow economics in the 1930s South. The film shows how the economic constraints imposed by segregation made it nearly impossible for Black people to prosper. Strict separations, lack of access to capital, peonage through convict leasing and sharecropping, and the ever-present threat of violence all contribute to the doomed fate of the film's protagonists.
