          <p>Vance Boelter, suspected of shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses in politically motivated attacks, was apprehended near his home after a 36-hour manhunt. Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed, while state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were wounded. Authorities said Boelter impersonated police officers during the shootings, and he surrendered to law enforcement. State officials have pledged to ensure justice is served, and Boelter faces charges of second-degree murder and attempted murder. Flags were ordered to fly at half-staff to honor the Hortmans. </p>

          <p>Gjert Ingebrigtsen, father and former trainer of Norwegian athlete Jakob Ingebrigtsen, was acquitted of abusing his son after a trial examining claims of a childhood marked by fear and intimidation.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is determined to proceed with plans to cut the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 2030, despite concerns from Labour MPs regarding the impact on disabled individuals. The proposed reforms include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and scrapping the work capability assessment in 2028. Up to 1.3 million people could lose some support under the changes, and the welfare package could push an extra 250,000 people into relative poverty. The government is introducing a 13-week transition period for those whose benefits are being withdrawn, but some MPs feel this is not enough.</p>

Hamilton, a vegan and animal lover, was more concerned about the groundhog's fate than the damage to his car. George Russell won the race, with Max Verstappen finishing second.</p>

Iranian media reported strikes on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, with reports of damage to Israel's energy infrastructure. Markets initially shrugged off the latest hostilities, with oil prices showing slight declines and Tel Aviv share indices pointing higher. Citigroup analysts suggest this muted reaction could be due to hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers highlights a concerning rise in violence targeting public officials at the state and local levels. This trend mirrors past incidents, such as the 2017 attack on a congressional baseball practice and assassination attempts against President Donald Trump. A 2015 Secret Service study suggests perpetrators are often driven by grievances, ideological beliefs, or a desire for attention, with many exhibiting signs of fixation and prior criminal records. Experts attribute this rise to declining confidence in social institutions, growing political divisions, and the targeting opportunities created by digital technology, emphasizing the need for increased security measures for public figures.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council's inability to address the Gaza conflict effectively stems from persistent divisions, particularly Russia and China's exploitation of the situation to divert attention from Ukraine. The US has often vetoed resolutions lacking condemnation of Hamas or recognition of Israel's rights. Some member states, like Slovenia, Algeria, and Guyana, have also pushed for actions against Israel, undermining US efforts to negotiate a durable solution.

          <p>The agriculture industry is facing increased immigration enforcement after initially being spared, leading to concerns about labor shortages. ICE officers have arrested workers at meatpacking plants and farms, causing fear among agricultural communities. While President Trump has suggested a solution for farmers, other administration officials maintain that anyone without legal status must leave. Farmers are requesting changes to visa programs to ensure access to a legal workforce, as they fear disruptions to the food supply chain if the labor force is impacted.</p>

          <p>Music therapy, which combines talk, music, and lyrical composition, is as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in managing cancer symptoms and anxieties. A study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting showed that music therapy can help patients process their emotions and improve their quality of life. The therapy involves trained therapists guiding patients in expressing their feelings through music creation and conversation. For some, like Cynthia Cherish Malaran, music therapy provided a way to cope with stress and emotions after being diagnosed with breast cancer, leading to healing and stress regulation.</p>
