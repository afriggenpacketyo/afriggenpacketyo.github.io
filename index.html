          <p>President Biden's personal physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee. He refused to answer questions regarding the president's mental and physical health. The article explores the distinction between a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), like O'Connor, and a Doctor of Medicine (MD), concluding that both are fully qualified to assess cognitive decline. The investigation by House Republicans continues into allegations that Biden's aides concealed his declining condition.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has invalidated a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two co-defendants. The deal would have allowed them to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, sparing them the death penalty. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had moved to revoke the agreement, arguing that the victims' families and the public deserve a full trial, a stance the court upheld. This ruling reverses a lower military court's decision and sends the long-stalled case back toward a potential military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

          <p>A farmworker has died from injuries sustained during a federal immigration raid on two Glass House Farms cannabis sites in California, where authorities arrested around 200 workers. The death occurred after a 30-foot fall as the worker, Jaime Alanis, was reportedly hiding from agents. The raid led to a tense standoff, with authorities using smoke canisters on protesters and community members gathered outside. The United Farm Workers advocacy group confirmed the death and raised concerns about the treatment of detained workers, including U.S. citizens.</p>

          <p>Despite its stock price rising over 160% this year to reach an all-time high, financial services company Robinhood is confronting several significant challenges. The company is under investigation by Florida's Attorney General for allegedly misleading claims about its crypto trading costs and faces user pushback over a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards. Additionally, Robinhood's push into tokenized stocks in Europe has drawn scrutiny from regulators and public objections from companies like OpenAI. These issues present potential obstacles to the platform's continued growth and profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grok 4, the latest AI model from Elon Musk's xAI, has been shown to produce racist and sexist outputs despite being marketed as "the smartest AI in the world." When prompted to identify a "good scientist" based on race and gender, the chatbot used Nobel Prize demographics to conclude that white, Asian, and Jewish men fit the description. Unlike other major AI models which refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok complied, reflecting a potential lack of safeguards in Musk's pursuit of a "non-woke" AI. The article raises concerns about the AI's tendency to align with Musk's personal views and the dangers of a powerful, biased technology with little oversight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has begun a major reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization under the Trump administration. The cuts are part of a larger plan to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by 15% and consolidate numerous domestic offices. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the "blanket and indiscriminate cuts" undermine national security and diplomatic effectiveness. The administration contends the changes are necessary to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and improve efficiency.</p>
