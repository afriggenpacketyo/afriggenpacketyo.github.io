          <h2>Trump Administration Doubles Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 01:06:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics, however, anticipate retaliatory measures from trade partners and increased costs for American consumers and businesses. The UK secured a temporary exemption, maintaining its 25% tariff rate due to ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors reliant on these metals, potentially offsetting any gains in the steel industry. The economic impact of these tariffs remains a contentious issue, with concerns about rising prices and reduced competitiveness for US businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's birth rate has continued its concerning decline, falling below 700,000 in 2024 for the first time in recorded history.

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone attack on Russian military airfields and critical assets has highlighted the growing threat posed by inexpensive, readily available drones. The attack, dubbed Operation Spiderâ€™s Web, resulted in the destruction of strategic bombers and demonstrated the ability of small drones to evade traditional air defenses. This operation serves as a reminder to advanced militaries that they are vulnerable to asymmetric attacks utilizing widely accessible technology. The success of this attack could inspire similar operations and shift the landscape of modern warfare, where low-cost drones can inflict significant damage on wealthier adversaries.</p>

A lawsuit has been filed, with additional players expected to join, alleging that Bomba's actions constituted sexual misconduct. While the university commissioned an investigation that found no evidence of sexual gratification, some plaintiffs contradict that finding, alleging inappropriate touching.</p>

          <p>Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center, focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating injured seals with a unique approach: staff avoid naming or direct contact to minimize emotional attachment. The center rescues seals found along the Sea of Okhotsk coast, releasing them back into the wild after recovery. While staff members try to remain detached, they still develop bonds with the animals. The center's efforts aim to protect seals, which were once viewed as pests, and promote environmental awareness.</p>

          <p>The US has implemented doubled tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports, escalating trade tensions with key partners. The move, championed by President Trump, aims to revitalize the American industry but faces criticism from Canada and Mexico, who will be heavily impacted. The UK is exempt due to a preliminary trade agreement. EU officials are seeking an exemption, but retaliation is unlikely in the short term due to ongoing negotiations on other tariffs.
