          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has expressed his desire for captain Martin Odegaard to embrace his natural creativity and take more risks, highlighting the midfielder's pivotal role in recent victories. After a Champions League win where Odegaard contributed to both goals, Arteta affirmed the 26-year-old has "total freedom" to explore and generate attacking opportunities. Despite a season start hampered by a shoulder injury, Odegaard's return has been impactful, with his attacking drive and passing crucial in recent matches, including a dramatic league comeback. His unique ability to create plays is considered his best asset, essential for the team's ongoing success.</p>

          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, head of the Metropolitan Police, has issued an apology for the "reprehensible and completely unacceptable" conduct of officers at Charing Cross station, as revealed by a BBC Panorama documentary. Undercover footage showed officers making racist remarks, sharing sexualized comments, reveling in excessive force, and being dismissive of sexual assault claims. This exposé has drawn widespread condemnation from the Home Secretary and London Mayor, prompting calls for urgent investigations and measures to remove officers unfit for service. The incident further erodes public trust, with critics noting the deep-seated nature of such behavior within the force.</p>

She expressed gratitude for her life but admitted to crying alone due to the constant scrutiny and differing public opinions since marrying Alec at 27. Despite the challenges, she highlighted the unwavering support from her family and friends like Kris Jenner, who cheered her on during a successful samba performance. Baldwin maintains that one never truly gets used to public meanness but learns to distance oneself from it.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy has intercepted multiple vessels of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) attempting to deliver aid to Gaza, detaining activists including Greta Thunberg. Israel's Foreign Ministry stated the ships were "safely stopped" for approaching an "active combat zone" and violating a "lawful naval blockade," transferring those aboard to an Israeli port. The GSF, however, condemned the interception as "illegal" and an act of "desperation" to maintain Gaza's isolation and starvation, alleging one vessel was rammed and others hit with water cannons. This incident occurs as international aid agencies report Israeli restrictions on supplies to Gaza, a claim Israel denies, citing efforts to prevent aid from reaching Hamas.</p>

          <p>Manchester City twice squandered a lead, drawing 2-2 with Monaco in the Champions League, with the equalizer coming in the 90th minute from a penalty. Star striker Erling Haaland, who scored both of City's goals, was critical of the team's performance, stating they "don't deserve to win" due to a lack of energy in the second half. This result continues a worrying trend for Pep Guardiola's side of conceding late goals, which has cost them crucial points in both the Premier League and Champions League. Despite being unbeaten in six games, Haaland's assessment underscores a perceived dip in performance compared to their usual standards.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown entered its first day after the Senate again failed to pass bills to fund federal operations, with negotiations expected to continue until at least Friday. Congressional leaders from both parties are trading blame, with Democrats insisting on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits and Republicans pushing for a "clean" stopgap bill. Despite the impasse, a bipartisan group of senators is reportedly exploring a shorter-term funding solution to create breathing room for further negotiations.

They argue that AI actors are artificial constructs trained without permission or compensation from real performers.

          <p>Jane Fonda has resurrected the Committee for the First Amendment, an activist group originally formed by her father, Henry Fonda, in 1947 to combat congressional probes into alleged Communist ties in Hollywood. The 21st-century incarnation, launched with hundreds of celebrity supporters including Florence Pugh and Sean Penn, aims to counter a "coordinated campaign to silence critics" by the federal government. The group's mission statement emphasizes free speech as foundational to American values, especially the ability to criticize those in power. This revival continues Fonda's long history of activism, from Vietnam War protests to climate change advocacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval among Latino voters is reportedly slipping, primarily due to economic concerns like high grocery and housing prices, according to recent polls. While Trump secured a historic 48% of Latino votes in 2024, disapproval of his economic handling is growing. Immigration reform has also risen as a key concern, with many Latinos fearing deportation amid the administration's crackdown. However, Democratic-commissioned polling indicates that this decline in Trump's support has not translated into major gains for Democrats, suggesting a need for the party to articulate clear benefits for Latino communities.</p>

However, the Trump administration is using the shutdown to threaten mass layoffs, potentially targeting Democratic states and priorities, with officials like Russ Vought announcing cuts to climate and infrastructure funding.

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is affecting critical federal agencies involved in wildfires, weather, and disaster response, though some "essential" operations continue. The U.S. Forest Service will close vast lands and reduce fire prevention work, while the National Weather Service will maintain core forecasting services. FEMA, largely exempt from furloughs, may face issues with new disaster declarations and its depleted Disaster Relief Fund, which requires congressional approval for replenishment. Experts warn that a prolonged shutdown could lead to significant backlogs and funding lapses, further weakening agencies like the EPA, which has already undergone staff cuts and deregulation.</p>

After leaving office, Carter made it his life's work, significantly reducing cases from 3.5 million in 1986 to a mere 14 by his death in 2024. The film emphasizes that this near-eradication was achieved through education and clean water initiatives, without vaccines or medication. Director Waleed Eltayeb highlights the collective human effort and hope embodied in the program, stressing that the success was a partnership, not solely Carter's achievement.</p>

          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, whose passing at 91 deeply impacted the scientific community, revolutionized human understanding of chimpanzees through her quiet, persistent observations in Tanzania. Her groundbreaking 1960 discovery of chimps using tools challenged long-held beliefs about human uniqueness, fundamentally reshaping evolutionary science. Despite initial cynicism and sexism from the male-dominated scientific establishment due to her lack of formal training, Goodall's work revealed complex chimp social structures and family bonds. She later dedicated her life to global conservation, urging action on climate change and inspiring countless scientists and environmental advocates worldwide.</p>
