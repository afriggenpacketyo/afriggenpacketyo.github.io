          <p>Countries across the globe are reacting to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule ahead of a looming deadline. Nations like Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief at receiving lower rates than initially proposed, viewing it as a positive development for their economies and a reflection of strong US ties. In contrast, countries such as Switzerland and Canada voiced disappointment over receiving high tariffs of 39% and 35% respectively, with Switzerland still hoping for a negotiated solution. The varied responses highlight the widespread economic impact and uncertainty generated by the new US trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new, higher tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, set to take effect in seven days. The executive order details duties ranging from 10% to over 40%, categorizing nations based on their trade balance with the United States. While some allies like Japan and the EU secured lower rates through recent deals, Canada faces a steep 35% tariff, which its Prime Minister criticized. The move has been met with concern over economic uncertainty, as many of the administration's promised trade deals have not materialized in a detailed form. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nintendo has reported a significant financial upswing, with its fiscal first-quarter revenue more than doubling year-over-year to 572.3 billion yen. This impressive growth is primarily attributed to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units since its release in early June. The company's operating profit also surpassed analyst expectations, reflecting strong market confidence and consumer excitement for the new hardware. Nintendo's stock has rallied approximately 40% this year, as the company anticipates selling 15 million Switch 2 units by March 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court decision could allow millions of car buyers to claim compensation over mis-sold finance deals. The ruling will determine the legality of hidden commission payments made to car dealers, a practice that may have inflated loan interest rates for consumers. The case centers on whether dealers had a duty to act in the buyer's best interest. A decision against the lenders could lead to billions in payouts, similar to the PPI scandal, with major financial institutions already setting aside funds in anticipation of a wave of claims.

She earned a bronze medal by participating in the heats of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, where China finished third in the final. Her participation has sparked a debate within the swimming community, as she was granted an exception to the minimum age rule of 14 due to her exceptional qualifying times. While some celebrate her as a young prodigy, others express concern about the potential long-term effects of high-level competition at such a young age.</p>

This wave of aggression continues despite a demand from US President Donald Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire by August 8 or face tougher sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a murderous response to peace efforts, while Russia also claimed advances on the eastern front.</p>

          <p>The latest US tariff announcement has resulted in sharply different outcomes for economies across Asia, which have been scrambling to negotiate deals since April. Key US allies like Japan and South Korea successfully reduced their proposed tariffs to 15%, while Taiwan negotiated a temporary 20% rate. Most Southeast Asian nations, including Vietnam and Thailand, landed tariffs around 19-20%, a significant reduction from initially threatened rates. However, India faces a 25% tariff amid ongoing irritation over its ties with Russia, while Laos and Myanmar were hit with some of the highest rates at 40%. (not investment advice)</p>

After successful trials confirmed the method is safe for the animals, the team officially launched the campaign by treating five rhinos.

          <p>An Oxnard man, Dustin Ronald Alba, has been sentenced to 111 years to life in prison for being a serial predator who used dating apps to find his victims. Alba was convicted of the sexual assault of five women between 2012 and 2020 in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. According to prosecutors, he would meet the women online, and after a first date, he would use his body weight to pin them down and assault them. The case came to light after one victim reported the assault to police in 2020, leading investigators to discover four other victims.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's process for handling the rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass a gridlocked Congress, more legal challenges are inevitable. He argued that the court has adapted by increasing its process, including writing more and scheduling oral arguments for these urgent cases. He stated he believes his colleagues are thoughtfully engaging with difficult issues and that collegiality among the justices remains strong.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under President Biden, has had her appointment as a distinguished chair at West Point rescinded. The Army Secretary's decision came shortly after a pro-Trump activist highlighted the hire on social media, accusing Easterly of undermining the Trump administration. Easterly lamented the move as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." This follows a pattern where other officials have been dismissed after being targeted by online activists, raising concerns about political pressure influencing military and academic appointments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for these individuals, who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years, some for decades. In her order, the judge stated that the administration's decision appeared to be motivated by racial animus and failed to properly review current conditions in the home countries. The protections will now remain in place at least until a November hearing.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States' failing healthcare system is a domestic issue, pushing back against President Trump's characterization of countries like Australia as "freeloaders" on U.S. medical research. The author points out that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse outcomes, including lower life expectancy. The article suggests that instead of blaming other countries for having price controls like Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the U.S. could adopt similar models to control its own prescription drug costs and improve its system.</p>

Harris clarified that she is not giving up the fight but wants to engage with Americans outside of a transactional political context.

          <p>This article provides a detailed look at the shock and chaos Thailand's government and industries faced when negotiating a tariff deal with the Trump administration. Initially hit with a potential 36% levy, Thai officials navigated a fraught process complicated by domestic politics and unrelated diplomatic grievances from the U.S. The deal, which ultimately reduced the tariff to 19%, required difficult concessions, particularly regarding access for U.S. agricultural products. The experience highlights the immense challenge and uncertainty that countries face when trying to strike trade deals with the current U.S. administration's unpredictable approach.
