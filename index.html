          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the storm's long-term impact on its youngest survivors, now adults, remains profound. Many faced persistent mental health problems, displacement, and the loss of family and homes, with thousands of children reported missing and hundreds of thousands uprooted. Filmmaker E'jaaz Mason, a survivor, documented how the disaster fractured community bonds and led to personal struggles, underscoring the importance of addressing trauma and hurricane preparedness. The article also highlights New Orleans' ongoing vulnerability to climate change and criticizes the "resilient" narrative for potentially shifting accountability from authorities to affected communities.</p>

          <p>Professor Mohd Rizal Arshad, a prominent Malaysian deep-sea robotics scientist, has relocated to China to further his work on underwater prototypes. Joining Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University's school of robotics, he was drawn by China's strong ecosystem for quickly moving research into industrial applications, its direct engagement with businesses, and convenient access to necessary components. Rizal envisions the ocean as a crucial future source for drinking water, food, minerals, and various forms of power, such as wave energy. This move underscores China's burgeoning global leadership in deep-sea science and its ability to attract top international talent for advanced research.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government is proposing modifications to its contentious tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, which currently mandate properties be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates. The new proposals suggest an average of 182 days let over multiple years, and would permit up to 14 days of charitable donations to count towards the target. While the government states it has considered feedback, industry bodies and Welsh language groups contend the changes are inadequate, asserting they do not resolve the housing crisis or the significant challenges confronting tourism businesses. A public consultation on these proposals is ongoing until November 20.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has declared he will boycott the upcoming state banquet for Donald Trump's visit, citing the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Sir Ed emphasized that despite the immense honor of a royal invitation, he feels it is essential to convey a message that Trump, given his influence over Israel and various Gulf states, possesses the capacity to end the starvation and facilitate the release of hostages. This carefully considered decision aims to exert pressure on both Trump and Keir Starmer to take decisive action. However, the move has been criticized by Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who deemed it "appalling judgment" and disrespectful to the King.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe experienced a significant 40% plunge in July, continuing a seven-month streak of declines, while its Chinese electric vehicle rival, BYD, recorded a remarkable 225% surge in new registrations. This downturn for Tesla occurred even as the overall European market for battery electric cars saw an increase. The article attributes Tesla's struggles to intense competition, reputational issues stemming from Elon Musk's public statements, and an aging vehicle lineup, with analysts noting the company's focus on AI and robotics rather than car refreshes. Chinese brands, spearheaded by BYD, are rapidly expanding across Europe with competitive pricing, gaining a record market share and affecting several established automakers.

          <p>Kansas City is in mourning following the tragic death of 26-year-old police officer Hunter Simoncic, who was fatally struck by a driver fleeing law enforcement. Simoncic, a dedicated officer who graduated from the department's academy in 2023, was deploying stop sticks early Tuesday morning to end a pursuit that originated from a shots-fired call. The suspect, Dennis Mitchell III, 31, faces charges including capital murder, for allegedly driving two stolen trucks and deliberately hitting the officer. Simoncic, a volunteer who read to children weekly, is remembered for his commitment to making positive changes in the community.</p>

While such relationships can provide a sense of connection and community, especially in online spaces, experts like Arthur C.

          <p>Argentine authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, strongly suspected of being looted by a fugitive Nazi officer eight decades ago, after it was recently featured in a property advertisement in the South American nation. The painting, identified as "Portrait of a Lady" by Italian Baroque artist Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was originally part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's vast collection before its seizure by Nazi officials. Police conducted a raid on a seaside villa in Argentina, believed to be owned by descendants of the Nazi fugitive, uncovering relevant German documents but not the artwork itself. This renewed investigation underscores Argentina's historical connection to sheltering Nazis and their stolen property post-World War II.</p>

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has incurred a substantial fine of almost £31,500 ($42,500) for his conduct during an unexpected first-round exit from the tournament. Medvedev's on-court meltdown, which notably included smashing a racket, was reportedly triggered by a photographer entering the court during his match against Benjamin Bonzi. The fine consists of $30,000 for unsportsmanlike behavior and an additional $12,500 for racket abuse, leading the Russian to forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money. Medvedev had publicly acknowledged he expected a significant penalty, choosing not to elaborate further to avoid potential additional repercussions.</p>

Although No 10 disputes claims about Pandit's performance, the BBC understands the Prime Minister had developed concerns regarding her effectiveness. The principal private secretary position is crucial, managing information flow and shaping the Prime Minister's schedule, and this change comes ahead of an anticipated reshuffle of junior ministers.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's latest film, "Caught Stealing," an adaptation of Charlie Huston's novel, is reviewed as a gritty, humorous crime caper set against the backdrop of a vibrant yet sleazy 1998 New York City. Austin Butler portrays Hank Thompson, a former professional baseball player whose life takes a perilous turn into a criminal underworld after a bizarre chain of events involving a cow and a cat. The article commends Aronofsky's affectionate depiction of pre-millennial New York, populated by vividly drawn characters and propelled by an energetic soundtrack. It particularly notes Butler's performance as a self-loathing alcoholic struggling to survive a dangerous predicament, and Aronofsky's consistent exploration of characters at risk of squandering their potential.</p>

Placed within monitored pens, they trigger an alert when a python is detected, enabling contractors to swiftly remove the snake. This initiative builds upon previous, more costly attempts using live rabbits and is part of broader efforts to manage the estimated tens to hundreds of thousands of pythons that have few natural predators.
