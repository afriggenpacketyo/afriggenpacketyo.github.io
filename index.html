          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery shares experienced a significant surge of over 25% on Thursday following a Wall Street Journal report that Paramount Skydance is preparing a takeover bid. Paramount Skydance also saw its shares rise by approximately 8% in afternoon trading. The reported bid would encompass the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, a company that recently announced plans to separate its global TV networks from its streaming business and studios. Representatives for both entertainment giants have declined to comment on this developing news, leaving investors to speculate on the potential industry consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services has surged, with many Americans using them for essential purchases, leading to a troubling trend of missed payments. A LegalShield survey indicates that nearly half of BNPL users have missed a payment, often managing multiple loans simultaneously. With FICO soon incorporating BNPL data into credit scores, missed payments will have real consequences. The article outlines strategies like consolidating debt, balance transfers, debt management plans, or DIY approaches to help consumers manage and eliminate BNPL debt before it negatively affects their credit.

This move continues a remarkable year for the "meme stock," which has seen shares climb over 500%. The change in leadership follows a period of investor pressure, and the company plans to leverage artificial intelligence to simplify the home buying and selling process.

          <p>South Sudan's Vice President, Riek Machar, has been formally charged with treason and crimes against humanity, stemming from a March attack on a military base that resulted in over 250 soldier deaths. Machar has been under house arrest since the incident, intensifying the fragile power-sharing arrangement with President Salva Kiir. His spokesman dismissed the charges as a "political witch hunt," while the Justice Minister emphasized accountability for atrocities. This development further destabilizes a nation still recovering from a five-year civil war that claimed approximately 400,000 lives.</p>

          <p>Nineteen suspected Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting a joint NATO interception and the first shots fired by NATO militaries during the Ukraine war. Polish authorities consider this a deliberate provocation, not an accident, given the sheer number of incursions. Poland has invoked NATO's Article 4 for consultations, with its Prime Minister stating the situation is the closest to open conflict since World War II. The incident, involving Iranian-designed Shahed and Russian Gerbera drones, raises questions about probing NATO defenses and the escalating risks of the conflict spilling over.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified a bolt-action rifle as the weapon used in the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, recovered in a wooded area near the crime scene. This type of rifle, common for hunting, is valued for its reliability but requires manual reloading after each shot, limiting its rate of fire. Experts note that bolt-action rifles often retain spent cartridges, potentially reducing forensic evidence like shell casings. Investigators are now focusing on tracing the weapon's history and ownership to identify the shooter, who remains at large.</p>

Both applications for home purchases and refinances have increased weekly and annually, with refinances making up nearly half of all applications.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage faces scrutiny over the £885,000 Clacton constituency home, bought in his partner Laure Ferrari's name without a mortgage. Farage denies avoiding over £44,000 in stamp duty, attributing the purchase to Ferrari's family wealth. However, a BBC investigation found no evidence to support this claim. This situation sparks accusations of hypocrisy, given Farage's recent criticism of former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner for similar tax avoidance. His solicitors maintain that expert tax advice confirms no underpayment of stamp duty, asserting the legality of the transaction.</p>

          <p>A former executive at Alphabet's health tech subsidiary, Verily, alleges the company used over 25,000 patients' health data without authorization and actively concealed HIPAA violations. Ryan Sloan claims he was fired after reporting these breaches, which an internal investigation reportedly confirmed. The violations, occurring between 2017 and 2021, affected patients from major clients like Walgreens and Delta Air Lines. Sloan's lawsuit states Verily delayed breach notifications and misrepresented its HIPAA compliance during contract negotiations. This case marks another challenge for Verily, which has struggled to find a consistently winning product despite significant investment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has declined to halt the Trump administration's plan to purge over 1,600 National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants, totaling more than $1 billion. The cuts, driven by the "department of government efficiency" (Doge) led by Elon Musk, target grants supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM, which congressional mandates aimed to boost. A coalition of scientific organizations challenged the terminations, arguing they were arbitrary and violated administrative law and due process. Despite the court's decision, the coalition vowed to continue its legal fight to protect the NSF's vital role in American innovation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has initiated an investigation into seven major tech companies, including OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, xAI, and Snap, regarding the safety of their AI chatbots for children and teenagers.

Concerns include monetization of engagement, character development, personal information use, and compliance monitoring. This probe follows previous reports of chatbots engaging in inappropriate conversations with minors and highlights growing ethical and privacy concerns as AI technology rapidly advances.</p>

          <p>The inflation-adjusted median monthly cost of homeownership in the U.S. has risen to $2,035 in 2024, a nearly 4% increase from the previous year. This cost, encompassing mortgage, insurance, taxes, and utilities, is primarily driven by higher mortgage rates, insurance premiums, and homeowners association (HOA) fees. Realtor.com's senior economist notes that these "behind-the-scenes culprits" are often overlooked by prospective buyers but significantly impact monthly expenses. Rising electricity costs, partly due to AI and data centers, further contribute to the financial burden on homeowners and renters alike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has lost his latest legal attempt in New Zealand to prevent his extradition to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website, Megaupload. Dotcom had sought a judicial review, arguing the extradition decision was politically motivated and that he would face disproportionate treatment. A judge dismissed these claims, upholding the justice minister's August 2024 decision. This marks another chapter in the 13-year legal battle, with Dotcom's lawyers indicating they still have "much fight left" as they consider an appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>

          <p>Joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises, Zapad 2025, involving tens of thousands of soldiers and new Oreshnik missiles, are heightening security fears in Lithuania and other Baltic states.

Experts express long-term concerns about Russia's intentions and potential for "hybrid attacks," including the use of migrants or drones, and fear an increased Russian presence in Belarus could precede future aggression if Ukraine's war outcome is unfavorable.</p>

Honeywell's stock has lagged due to complex spin-off plans, including its Solstice Advanced Materials business and a future aerospace division separation, which are expected to unlock value. Separately, the trust would consider trimming its Broadcom position, which has surged nearly 20% recently, to manage portfolio size and lock in gains.

          <p>European Union officials are grappling with a demand from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 100% tariff on goods from China and India, aimed at halting their purchases of Russian energy. Trump indicated the U.S. would match this move only if Europe acts in tandem. This request, confirmed by the EU's sanctions envoy, presents a significant challenge for the bloc, which has been seeking to engage Trump on China policy to secure support for Ukraine. While pleased with Trump's focus on punishing Russia, doubts persist about the feasibility of implementing such drastic tariffs.</p>
