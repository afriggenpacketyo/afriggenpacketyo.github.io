          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The nationalized service, running from Woking to Surbiton, departed on time, and the government is emphasizing improved services and infrastructure reinvestment rather than promising lower fares. Unions have raised concerns about potential outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservative opposition is urging Labour to fulfill their promises. SWR trains are now managed by the Department for Transport Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, and the first service will feature the new GBR livery.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Mykolaiv. The attacks targeted residential areas, destroying homes and causing fires, with children among the casualties. Russia's defense ministry claims its air defense units intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions during the same period, but no casualties were reported on the Russian side. These attacks occurred as Russia and Ukraine continue prisoner swaps, with hundreds of soldiers and civilians exchanged in recent days following talks in Turkey.</p>

          <p>U.S. Special Envoy Thomas Barrack met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and commended him for "taking meaningful steps" on foreign fighters and improving relations with Israel.

Discussions focused on the implementation of the sanctions waiver and means to support foreign investments in Syria, particularly in energy and infrastructure. The Syrian side expressed readiness to provide necessary facilitation to attract investors and contribute to reconstruction efforts.</p>

          <p>Despite securing key trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union, which are expected to boost the British economy, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is experiencing record low approval ratings. A recent YouGov poll indicates that 69% of British voters have an unfavorable view of Starmer, with dissatisfaction concentrated among Labour voters. This unpopularity stems from domestic pressures, including rising inflation and concerns over cost-of-living, as well as tax increases implemented by the Labour government. While business leaders acknowledge the positive direction of the government's trade policies, many consumers and small businesses are struggling with immediate financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani is likely to return to the mound after the All-Star break, according to manager Dave Roberts. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. The Dodgers initially considered having him return to pitching early in the season but decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training, slowing down his pitching rehab. Ohtani threw all his pitches in practice on Wednesday, including a slider, which he had previously avoided due to the burden on his elbow.</p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in Malibu, California, has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend after being closed due to the Palisades Fire in January. The closure had isolated the beach city and hindered local businesses. While the reopening brings relief, it also raises concerns among residents about increased traffic, lookie-loos, and potential looting. The fire, which killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres, left visible scars, and the community is still grappling with the trauma and loss.</p>

Rail unions have welcomed the takeover, while the government anticipates saving up to Â£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators. The renationalization process is expected to continue with Southeastern and Eastern services by the end of 2025.</p>

The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress and a tendency to ruminate about work exhibited more stress-related behaviors. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that dogs are highly sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in routine. The study underscores the importance of separating work life from home life to protect the well-being of pets.</p>
