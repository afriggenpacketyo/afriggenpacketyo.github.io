            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelan deportees from the U.S., who are currently imprisoned in El Salvador, in exchange for the release of 252 political prisoners held in Venezuela. Bukele directed his proposal to President Nicol√°s Maduro via social media, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained in Venezuela. The proposal comes amidst international scrutiny of El Salvador's treatment of deportees, who are held in a "mega-prison." Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded critically, demanding a list of the detainees and their legal status. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>A slow-moving storm system brought heavy rain, large hail, and tornadoes to parts of Texas and Oklahoma, resulting in three fatalities and widespread damage. In Moore, Oklahoma, two people died due to high-water incidents, while another death occurred in Spaulding after a tornado touched down.

JPMorgan expects President Donald Trump's tariff blitz to yield "some deals" between the US and its trade partners, but says tax rates will still multiply in size.

While the show previously expanded on the game's characters and themes successfully, Season 2's plot detours feel awkwardly inserted, diminishing the shock and impact of key events. The reviewer argues that the show has become a punishing watch, leaning too far into characters' anguish and losing the elegant insights of the first season. Optimism score: 40</p>
