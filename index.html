          <p>A vehicle plowed into a crowd waiting to enter a nightclub in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, injuring 30 people, with at least seven in critical condition. The Nissan Versa also struck a taco truck and a valet stand before stopping. In the immediate aftermath, patrons from inside the club rushed to assist the victims before emergency services arrived. The Los Angeles Police Department has launched a major investigation into the incident, which involved 124 firefighters responding to the chaotic scene.</p>

          <p>The UK is under multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, raising concerns about potential flash flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions across all four nations. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts remain possible. The alerts follow a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall. The Met Office has extended some warnings into Monday, indicating a prolonged period of unsettled weather.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has expressed a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy, which would be a significant move for both clubs. For Manchester United, the transfer would provide substantial wage bill savings, freeing up funds for new signings under head coach Ruben Amorim. Rashford, who spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, is currently training separately from the main squad.</p>

          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. has issued a recall for more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco" brand ready-to-eat chicken sausage products after they were found to be potentially contaminated with pieces of white plastic. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced the recall following three consumer complaints. The affected products were produced on June 28, 2025, and distributed nationwide. Consumers are advised to either discard the products or return them to the place of purchase, though no injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>A month after the United States conducted "Operation Midnight Hammer," significant uncertainty remains about the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The operation involved B-2 bombers using "bunker buster" bombs to target these key uranium enrichment facilities. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported no increase in regional radiation levels, experts warn of potential chemical hazards from the release of uranium hexafluoride gas. The strikes did not target Iran's active Bushehr nuclear power plant, which is run on Russian-supplied fuel.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Wipha is forecast to intensify into a typhoon as it approaches the coast of southern China, after causing disruptions in Taiwan and the Philippines. In Taiwan, the storm brought heavy rain, leading to domestic flight cancellations and the suspension of ferry services. Chinese authorities in Fujian and Hainan provinces have also suspended ferry operations and closed ports in preparation. Hong Kong is bracing for the storm's impact, with Cathay Pacific canceling numerous flights and officials warning of potential flooding from storm surges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed a presidential request to rescind $9 billion in previously approved federal spending, affecting programs like foreign aid and public broadcasting. The move, known as a rescissions request, passed with a simple majority in the Senate, unlike typical budget appropriations that require 60 votes. Analysts suggest this could be a test case for shifting the federal budgeting process from a bipartisan necessity to a more partisan-driven one. This change could dramatically alter how federal funds are allocated in the future by circumventing the need for broader consensus.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being drawn into an MRI machine at a diagnostic center in Westbury, New York. The man reportedly entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress, and a large metallic chain around his neck was forcefully pulled by the machine's powerful magnet. Medical experts emphasize that MRI magnets are always active and that strict safety protocols, including the removal of all metallic objects, are critical to prevent such rare but tragic accidents. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration notes that projectile events are an infrequent but known risk associated with MRI scans.</p>

The article also notes a decline in vaccine confidence, with surveys showing a majority of pregnant women and parents do not intend to fully vaccinate their children.

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that Americans, on average, believe they need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable. However, financial experts caution that net worth can be a misleading metric, as it provides only a snapshot of one's financial position and doesn't account for cash flow or personal values. Experts suggest that true financial comfort is achieved when money management aligns with personal goals like security or freedom, rather than fixating on a specific number. They advise focusing on a holistic view of finances, including debt reduction, savings, and future investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a recent IRS policy change, which allows clergy to endorse political candidates without risking their church's nonprofit status, is a "Faustian bargain." The author contends that while this seems like a victory for some religious groups, it risks turning houses of worship into de facto political organizations, susceptible to pressure from PACs and partisan congregants. The piece suggests this shift prioritizes political instruction over the formation of individual conscience, which could alienate members and further polarize congregations.

          <p>The prospect of President Trump attempting to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has raised complex legal and economic questions with no clear precedent. Legally, a president can only remove a Fed chair "for cause," a high bar that would likely trigger a protracted court battle. Economically, such a move could undermine the Fed's independence, rattle financial markets, and potentially lead to higher inflation and interest rates if the central bank's credibility is damaged.

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who thought a lump in her groin was a pulled muscle from working out was diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. Unusually, her cancer did not present with a typical skin mole. She underwent an aggressive treatment combining gamma knife radiation and immunotherapy, which caused severe side effects but ultimately led to what her doctor called a "miraculous" improvement. After 18 months, her cancer has not progressed, and her story highlights the importance of investigating unusual lumps and the advancements in modern cancer treatments.</p>

          <p>Over the 25 years since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), China has achieved "leapfrog development" in its relationship with the continent. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted that trade has surged nearly 30-fold and investment has grown 100-fold since 2000. This economic partnership has been paralleled by a significant increase in security cooperation, with China becoming a leading arms supplier and training thousands of African military officers annually. This strategic dialogue mechanism has allowed China to significantly expand its economic and military footprint in Africa, often outpacing traditional powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece examines a proposal by NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to create city-owned grocery stores aimed at lowering food prices for residents. The author argues that this goal is undermined by other progressive policies the candidate supports, such as a near-doubling of the minimum wage and expanded worker benefits, which would significantly increase operating costs. The article questions whether a public grocery store could truly prioritize low prices while also adhering to progressive values in procurement, labor, and security. It suggests that without clarifying these trade-offs, the promise of cheaper groceries is likely untenable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has announced plans to significantly reduce its Military Working Equid program, making 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules available for adoption.

While the Army has not used equids in combat since 1942, these animals are considered a vital, living connection to American military heritage. The Army has assured that the animals will be treated with compassion and that ceremonial animals will be retained at key locations like Arlington.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the U.S. has enacted its first major cryptocurrency legislation, the GENIUS Act, which establishes new rules for stablecoins. The bill, signed into law by President Trump, mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain proper reserves and adhere to anti-money laundering protocols. While supporters hail it as a step toward cementing American dominance in financial technology, critics argue the rules are too weak and heavily influenced by industry lobbying. A second, more contentious bill, the CLARITY Act, which would shift regulatory power to the CFTC, has also passed the House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate.</p>

          <p>With longer life expectancies, baby boomers planning to retire within the next five years face the challenge of ensuring their savings last for decades. Financial experts suggest that a specific dollar amount is less important than a personalized plan based on individual circumstances and lifestyle. One common guideline is to have saved at least 10 to 12 times one's current annual income to account for inflation and longevity. Another approach is to calculate a percentage of pre-retirement income needed, as living costs may change after leaving the workforce. (not investment advice)</p>
