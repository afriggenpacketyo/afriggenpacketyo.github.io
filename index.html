          <p>An Air India passenger plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick, resulting in at least 204 fatalities and numerous injuries.

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the single remaining charge of third-degree sexual assault. This decision followed concerns raised by the jury foreperson regarding threats from another juror, leading to a security detail and the foreperson's inability to continue deliberating. The jury had previously reached a partial verdict, finding Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola. Prosecutors intend to pursue a third trial on the sexual assault charge, with a status hearing scheduled for July 2 to determine the case's future.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Israel is contemplating military action against Iran in the near future, potentially coinciding with planned nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iranian officials.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has asserted that Iran will continue uranium enrichment and rebuild any destroyed facilities, highlighting the escalating tensions in the Middle East. These developments occur against the backdrop of ongoing negotiations concerning a potential U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, which could influence Israel's decision-making process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "numbskull" for not lowering interest rates. Trump claimed that reducing rates by two percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion annually. These remarks follow similar comments from other administration officials, who have also pressured the Fed to cut rates due to low inflation. While markets remain largely unmoved by Trump's remarks, traders are assigning a higher probability of a rate cut in September. Trump also reiterated that he is "not going to fire" Powell, despite disagreeing with his monetary policy decisions.</p>

Fifty-three percent of voters surveyed in the Quinnipiac University poll expressed opposition, while 27% supported the bill. The GOP-crafted measure, which passed the House by a narrow margin, includes extensions to Trump's 2017 tax cuts and changes to Medicaid, a key point of contention for Democrats.

          <p>Debt collectors may be illegally re-aging old debts, a practice where they reset the clock on expired debts to make them appear newer on credit reports. This allows them to pursue payment more aggressively, even taking legal action that would otherwise be barred by statutes of limitations. Consumers can identify re-aging by checking credit reports for debts that reappear after seven years or have suspiciously recent delinquency dates. If re-aging is suspected, individuals should file a dispute with credit bureaus and report the debt collector to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect their credit history.</p>

          <p>A teenager who was tricked into moving to boarding school in Ghana by his parents has won a legal appeal to have his case reheard in London. The boy, who was taken to Ghana under the pretense of a relative's illness, claims he is unhappy and homesick and considers himself abandoned by his family. His parents wanted to remove him from London because they feared he was being drawn into criminal activity. The Court of Appeal granted his appeal, recognizing the importance of considering the voices of young people in legal proceedings that profoundly affect their lives.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's inspector general is investigating the Trump administration's efforts to lay off Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) employees and cancel agency contracts. This review follows a request from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim, who raised concerns about the legality and impact of these actions. The investigation will examine the extent to which these moves hindered the CFPB's mission. The fate of the CFPB also depends on an upcoming court decision regarding the Trump administration's appeal over its plans for the agency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low on Thursday following President Donald Trump's renewed trade threats and signs of a weakening economy, leading to increased speculation about potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Foreign exchange traders sold the dollar in favor of the yen and the euro. The slide was prompted by Trump's threat to impose country-specific tariff rates and concerns about the U.S. economy's growth prospects. Meanwhile, the UK is expected to receive a trade boost from a bilateral trade deal with the U.S., although concerns about the UK economy have limited the pound's gains.</p>

The Irish government opened its doors to multinational corporations following an economic crisis in the 1980s, and many companies adopted strategies like the "double Irish" to minimize their tax liabilities.

Recent data on consumer and producer prices indicate only modest increases. Experts suggest that factors like companies stockpiling imported goods, the time lag for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power have kept inflation in check. However, economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs will materialize in the coming months, potentially leading to price increases driven by Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>There has been an unexpected surge in people claiming Social Security benefits, with claims nearly 18% higher between January and May compared to the same period last year. The Social Security Administration attributes this to a peak of retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change increasing benefits for some with pensions, and people refiling for higher benefits based on their own records. However, concerns about the economic future under the Trump administration are also driving some individuals to claim benefits earlier than planned. Many are worried about potential cuts to Social Security and Medicaid, leading them to claim benefits while they still can.</p>
