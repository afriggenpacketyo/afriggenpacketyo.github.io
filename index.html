        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that China holds the key to de-escalating trade tensions with the United States, citing the significant trade imbalance between the two nations. Bessent noted progress in negotiations with other countries, suggesting a potential trade deal with India in the near future. He also speculated that European nations are concerned about the euro's strength against the dollar due to the trade tensions and may consider cutting interest rates. Bessent emphasized that the White House will not conduct trade negotiations through the press, despite mixed signals from administration officials regarding the status of talks with China.</p>

          <p>A BBC internal review, prompted by the Huw Edwards scandal, revealed that a small number of BBC employees and managers engage in unacceptable behavior, with inadequate action taken by superiors. While the report found no widespread toxic culture, it highlighted instances of powerful individuals abusing their positions, creating difficult environments for colleagues. The BBC chairman, Samir Shah, pledged reforms, including a more robust disciplinary policy and improved complaint mechanisms, emphasizing that those who abuse power have no place at the corporation. The report's recommendations prioritize action over procedural change to ensure a respectful workplace culture at the BBC.</p>

          <p>A US air strike on a detention center in Houthi-controlled Yemen has reportedly killed at least 68 African migrants and injured 47, according to Houthi-run media. The facility in Saada province was allegedly holding 115 migrants when it was struck multiple times. The Houthi-run interior ministry condemned the bombing as a war crime, while the UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) expressed deep sadness and called for the protection of civilians. Migrants continue to arrive in Yemen from the Horn of Africa, seeking work in Saudi Arabia, but face exploitation, detention, and dangerous conditions in the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>A report highlights the failure of mental health services in Montana, where individuals accused of crimes and experiencing mental health crises are often held in small jail cells due to a lack of adequate facilities. Lake County Attorney James Lapotka expresses concern over the use of isolation cells for individuals awaiting beds at the state psychiatric hospital, some for months. The state acknowledges the problem, citing staffing shortages and a lack of community-based services, but counties argue that local resources are insufficient. Health advocates are pushing for increased funding for community commitments and new psychiatric facilities to address the crisis and provide appropriate care for those in need.</p>

          <p>Periodical cicadas from Brood XIV are expected to emerge across the eastern United States in the spring of 2025, particularly in Kentucky and Tennessee. These cicadas, characterized by their red eyes and translucent wings, spend 17 years underground as larvae before emerging en masse for mating. The emergence is triggered by soil temperatures reaching 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and the loud buzzing is a mating tactic used by males to attract females. While harmless to humans and pets, cicadas can benefit the ecosystem by aerating soil and providing nutrients when they decompose.</p>

          <p>A billboard in Times Square, sponsored by PatientsRightsAdvocate.org, praises President Donald Trump for delivering on healthcare price transparency within his first 100 days in office. The billboard highlights Trump's executive order directing the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments to enforce healthcare price transparency regulations. PRA founder Cynthia Fisher claims this initiative will give patients access to actual prices, not estimates, before receiving care, fostering competition and lowering costs. The White House projects potential savings of $80 billion for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025 if the original price transparency rules are fully implemented.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8-10, coinciding with Russia's World War II Victory Day commemorations; however, Ukraine quickly accused Putin's forces of violating a previous Easter ceasefire. This action comes amid pressure from the Trump administration on both Kyiv and Moscow to reach a peace agreement. President Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and indicated that Zelenskyy is ready to make a peace deal. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the Kremlin is ready to reach a deal with the U.S. on Ukraine, though some elements need further refinement.</p>

The woman's funerary trousseau included a toucan's beak, a stone bowl, and a straw basket, indicating her elevated status in Caral society. Preliminary analyses suggest she was between 20 and 35 years old and wore a headdress symbolizing her social rank, challenging the notion that rulers were exclusively male.</p>

This strategy is crucial as Ukraine faces potential shifts in US military support and attempts to strike a ceasefire agreement. The program aims to bolster Ukraine's ability to maintain its fight against Russian forces, particularly if external arms shipments are reduced or discontinued.</p>

Senator Adam Schiff and Representative Mike Levin, along with 23 other Democrats, sent a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, requesting transparency regarding securities transactions by senior White House and executive branch employees. The request follows Trump's announcement of tariff rollbacks, which caused the stock market to surge, prompting suspicion that individuals with access to non-public information may have profited from the decision.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Lorenz A., a Black man, by police in Oldenburg, Germany, has ignited protests and calls for an independent investigation. Civil rights activists are raising concerns about systemic racism within German law enforcement, particularly as the officer's body camera was turned off during the incident. Prosecutors stated that preliminary evidence contradicts initial police reports, suggesting Lorenz A. may not have posed an immediate threat. The incident has drawn comparisons to police violence cases in the United States and has renewed calls for independent oversight and systemic reform within German police forces.</p>

During a third-round match between Britain's Jacob Fearnley and Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, the electronic line-calling system and scoreboards ceased functioning. Initially, the umpire attempted to resume play by making line calls manually, but the presence of a malfunctioning spider camera led to the decision to halt the match and send players back to the locker room.</p>

          <p>New York City's subway map has undergone its first major overhaul in nearly 50 years, aiming to simplify navigation for riders. The new design, reminiscent of the 1972 Unimark map, prioritizes legibility with bolder lines and clearer distinctions between train routes. While the map retains simplified outlines of the boroughs, it moves away from the geographically accurate representation of the city aboveground. The redesign seeks to balance clarity with the unique challenges of mapping New York's grid-based street system and complex subway network.</p>

          <p>President Trump has resurrected Schedule F, a policy that would reclassify tens of thousands of government employees, making them at-will hires serving at the president's pleasure. Critics argue that this move would undermine the independence of civil servants, who are obligated to apply the law and provide impartial advice. The policy prioritizes loyalty to the president over expertise and could lead to political intimidation within the bureaucracy. While some argue that federal personnel policy needs reform, replacing career civil servants with political appointees is unlikely to improve government effectiveness.</p>

The mixed reviews reflect the challenge of balancing the long-standing union argument for tariffs with the broader economic consequences and the potential for job losses. While tariffs can bolster manufacturing, Trump's policy is viewed as broad, inconsistent, and lacking a clear vision for boosting American industry.</p>
