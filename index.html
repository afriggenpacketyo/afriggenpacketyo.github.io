          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops from California and Texas to Oregon. This decision follows an earlier order that prevented Oregon's own National Guard from being deployed to Portland amid ongoing protests. State governors, including Oregon's Tina Kotek and California's Gavin Newsom, have strongly opposed the federal intervention, arguing there is no need for military presence and accusing the administration of political motivations. The judge questioned the federal government's attempt to circumvent previous rulings, emphasizing that local law enforcement is capable of managing the relatively small protests.</p>

          <p>Sarah Mullally has been appointed as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, marking a historic moment as she becomes the first woman to lead the Church of England. Mullally, formerly England's chief nursing officer and Bishop of London, is known for her progressive views, including supporting blessings for same-sex couples. Her appointment, succeeding Justin Welby, who resigned amidst an abuse scandal, has been met with criticism from some conservative Anglican groups but signifies a significant reform within the church.</p>

          <p>Japanese stock markets, including the Nikkei 225 and Topix, surged to record highs, while the yen weakened significantly past 150 against the dollar, following Sanae Takaichi's election as the Liberal Democratic Party leader. Investors anticipate Takaichi, a proponent of "Abenomics," will maintain an accommodative monetary policy and pursue expansionist fiscal spending to boost the economy. This market reaction reflects expectations for continued pro-growth policies, though a weaker yen raises concerns about domestic issues like overtourism and property prices.

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll indicates broad public dissatisfaction with the ongoing government shutdown, with few Americans believing either party's position justifies the impasse. President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans all received net negative approval for their handling of the situation. Concerns about the shutdown's economic impact are high, and a majority feel the Trump administration is not focused enough on lowering prices. The poll highlights a perception of political distraction from critical issues and a desire for congressional authority over spending.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged negotiators to "move fast" on a Gaza peace deal as crucial talks begin in Cairo, following Hamas's conditional acceptance of parts of his proposed plan. Trump expressed optimism for a lasting peace and a rapid resolution, with the first phase, including hostage release, potentially concluding this week. While Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu hopes for a quick announcement on hostages, he signaled no full withdrawal from Gaza. US and Egyptian officials are involved in discussions focusing on a hostage-for-prisoner exchange.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed Navy sailors during a 250th-anniversary celebration, assuring them they would receive every penny of their pay despite the ongoing government shutdown. He urged them not to worry, attributing the shutdown to Democrats. Federal employees, including service members, are currently furloughed or working without pay. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated the House "did its job" by passing a clean spending bill, while the Senate is set to vote again on funding bills.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's various companies are experiencing a significant turnover of top employees, attributed to his demanding work culture and increasingly controversial political stances. Former employees describe a "24/7 campaign-style work ethos" and unease about Musk's public views, leading many to seek opportunities elsewhere. This exodus affects critical areas, including Tesla's pivot towards robotics and AI, raising concerns about the retention of talent in competitive industries like artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The article explores the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity," a proposed transport link through Armenia connecting Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan. Envisioned by President Trump to end the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, the project faces immense geopolitical hurdles beyond its physical construction. Russian border troops still patrol the area, Iran views the route with suspicion, and European interests see it as a bypass for Russia. While Trump's intervention has brought temporary peace, the complex interplay of regional and global powers makes the project's future uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal workers union has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Education compelled employees to disseminate partisan messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. The lawsuit claims that the department replaced employees' out-of-office email replies with pre-written, politically charged language without their consent, violating First Amendment rights. Ethics experts suggest such actions could also breach the Hatch Act, which restricts political activity by civil servants. The legal challenge highlights concerns over the politicization of federal communications during the shutdown.</p>
