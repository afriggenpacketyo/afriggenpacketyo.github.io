          <p>U.S. Steel shares ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange following the completion of its acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. The deal, finalized after initial opposition from former President Biden, was approved under President Trump, who touted a "partnership" between the companies. Nippon Steel has agreed to make substantial investments in U.S. Steel, including an $11 billion commitment by 2028 and the steel will continue to be "mined, melted, and made" in the United States. The agreement includes a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, ensuring U.S. Steel remains a U.S.-incorporated entity and that the majority of its board members are U.S. citizens.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld a Tennessee law restricting gender transition care for minors, determining that the law does not constitute discrimination. The ruling is expected to have widespread implications, as similar laws have been enacted in 25 states. The plaintiffs, including transgender teenagers and a doctor, argued that the ban violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law by discriminating on the basis of sex. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion, stating that the court was leaving policy decisions to elected representatives. The liberal justices dissented, with Justice Sotomayor expressing concern for the abandonment of transgender children to political whims. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, questioning his intelligence and political motivations ahead of the Fed's latest interest rate decision. Trump asserted that interest rates should be significantly lower and accused Powell of costing the country a fortune. Market expectations indicated no probability of a rate cut at the current meeting, with the next move anticipated in September. Powell and the Fed have expressed caution about adjusting rates due to uncertainties surrounding the economy and the impact of Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Iowa, which has the second-highest cancer rate in the nation, is seeing an increase in cancer cases, prompting a new research project investigating potential environmental causes. Many residents blame the insecticides, herbicides, and pesticides widely used on farms, as well as high levels of nitrates in the state’s water supply. The research will also look at cancer links to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs) and high levels of radon. The focus on agricultural practices as a potential cause is controversial, given the industry's significant contribution to the state's economy. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, is implementing policies reminiscent of Donald Trump's administration, despite initial promises to resist such influences. The government is using an "emergency" narrative to justify corporate giveaways and weaken environmental regulations. New legislation centralizes power within the executive branch, allowing for the waiver of federal laws for projects deemed in the "national interest". These actions prioritize corporate interests and resource extraction over Indigenous rights and environmental protection. The optimism score is 20.</p>
