          <p>Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down from her long-held position as editor-in-chief of American Vogue, a role she has defined for nearly four decades. The 75-year-old fashion icon will not be leaving the industry entirely, as she is set to retain her senior roles as Vogue's global editorial director and chief content officer for publisher CondÃ© Nast. This move marks a significant transition for the influential publication, which will introduce a new head of editorial content for its American edition.

          <p>Apple has introduced a complex new fee structure for its App Store in Europe in an effort to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and avoid a potential â‚¬500 million fine. The changes, which Apple states it is making under duress, include a new "core technology commission" and a multi-fee system for some developers, which critics like Spotify argue violate the spirit of the regulation. The European Commission is currently reviewing Apple's new terms to determine compliance, while the company maintains its plan is sufficient and has announced its intention to appeal the EU's decision, highlighting the global regulatory pressure on its business model.</p>

          <p>An analysis of current interest rates reveals a close competition between short-term certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts for maximizing returns on a $10,000 deposit. For 3-month and 6-month terms, CDs currently offer slightly higher earnings, while a high-yield savings account outperforms a 9-month CD. However, the key difference lies in flexibility, as CD rates are locked in while savings account rates are variable and could change. The article suggests that savers should consider their outlook on future interest rate trends when deciding between the security of a fixed-rate CD and the liquidity of a high-yield savings account.

          <p>Mexico's Supreme Court has issued a landmark ruling in favor of singer Sasha Sokol, setting a precedent that removes the statute of limitations for civil claims in cases of child sexual abuse. The court upheld a lower court's civil conviction against music producer Luis de Llano for the abusive relationship he had with Sokol when she was 14 and he was 39. This decision denies de Llano's appeal and confirms he must issue a public apology and pay damages. Sokol celebrated the verdict, stating it opens a path for other victims to seek justice and that establishing the truth is the first step toward healing from past trauma.</p>

It also emphasizes media literacy, urging citizens to follow reputable government and news sources to avoid misinformation.

          <p>A new study from the Pew Research Center concludes that Donald Trump would have won the 2024 presidential election by an even larger margin if every eligible American had voted. The survey, which validated voter participation, found that non-voters in 2024 favored Trump over Kamala Harris, a significant shift from 2020 and 2016 when non-voters preferred the Democratic candidate. This finding challenges the long-held political assumption that higher turnout universally benefits Democrats. The research also highlighted a demographic shift, with Trump's 2024 coalition becoming more ethnically diverse compared to 2016, while Harris's coalition became whiter than Hillary Clinton's.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat poses a significant and growing threat to transportation infrastructure, according to engineering professor Mikhail Chester of Arizona State University. High temperatures can cause materials like asphalt and concrete to expand and buckle, leading to damage on roads and airport runways. Railway tracks are also vulnerable to bending, which can cause derailments and necessitate speed restrictions for trains, causing system-wide delays. As climate change leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves, these impacts create major challenges for maintaining the safety and reliability of critical transportation networks, requiring new strategies for design and maintenance to ensure public mobility and safety.</p>

          <p>Two Metropolitan Police officers have been dismissed for gross misconduct following the strip-search of a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, known as Child Q, at her school in 2020. A disciplinary panel found the search, conducted while the girl was menstruating and without an appropriate adult present, was unjustified and humiliating. While the panel noted that Black children are often perceived as older, it did not conclude that race was a direct factor in this specific case, a finding that contrasts with a previous safeguarding report. The incident has sparked widespread public outrage and highlighted issues of trust between Black communities and the police in London.</p>

          <p>Recent research from Apple, Salesforce, and other AI labs indicates that advanced AI reasoning models may not be developing true problem-solving capabilities, despite industry hype. A paper from Apple researchers titled "The Illusion of Thinking" found that these models' accuracy collapses when faced with problems beyond a certain complexity, suggesting they may be memorizing patterns rather than genuinely reasoning. This raises questions about the long-term trajectory of AI development and the massive computational investments being made, as championed by companies like Nvidia. Some experts, however, speculate that Apple's findings could be a strategic move to reframe the conversation as it works to catch up in the AI race.</p>

          <p>A TransUnion analysis reveals that a record 31% of federal student loan borrowers with a payment due are now in late-stage delinquency, over 90 days past due. This signals a looming "default cliff," with millions at risk of entering default status, which occurs after 270 days of non-payment and triggers involuntary collection actions like wage garnishment. The resumption of collections by the Trump administration has already led to significant credit score drops for past-due borrowers. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York echoed these concerns, warning that millions could see substantial declines in their credit standing, impacting their financial stability for years.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of U.S. strikes on Iran, international reactions continue to unfold, with various nations and organizations weighing in on the volatile situation. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson stated that military force will not undermine their rights, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the operation a "great victory" that creates an opportunity for peace. Russian President Vladimir Putin commented that the situation appears to be calming down, and the IAEA Director General noted that Iran's centrifuges at the Fordow facility have likely suffered significant damage.

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's self-imposed July deadlines for imposing tariffs on the European Union and other countries are "not critical" and could be extended. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president could simply provide countries with a deal if one is not reached by the deadline, or he could set a reciprocal tariff rate he deems advantageous. This flexibility suggests that countries engaged in good-faith negotiations may avoid having higher tariff rates snap back into place. The administration has so far only finalized trade frameworks with China and the United Kingdom, with several other potential deals reportedly close to completion.</p>

The comment came after Trump likened the two nations to fighting children, with Rutte interjecting that "Daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop." Trump appeared to receive the nickname affectionately, while Rutte later defended the comment and praised Trump as a "good friend." Rutte subsequently clarified to Reuters that he was not literally calling the president "daddy" but using the term metaphorically to describe the relationship between the U.S. and other nations.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, debt management programs can offer a path to financial stability, but it's crucial to identify and avoid predatory companies. Key warning signs of a questionable program include guaranteeing specific results, demanding large upfront payments before providing services, and a lack of transparency about the process and fees. A legitimate credit counseling agency will conduct a thorough review of your entire financial situation before recommending a tailored solution. They will also be upfront about the potential impact on your credit score and discuss all available alternatives, rather than pushing a single, fee-generating product.</p>

This verbal assault comes as Trump confirms he has a shortlist of candidates to replace Powell in 2026, raising concerns about the politicization of the central bank and its independence. The ongoing conflict has impacted markets, with traders increasing bets on interest rate cuts.

          <h2>Details Emerge on President Trump's "Golden Share" Veto Power Over U.S. Steel</h2>

          <p>Following the approval of the U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel merger, President Donald Trump now personally holds a "golden share" that gives him sweeping veto power over the company's key decisions. According to an SEC filing, this power allows Trump to block actions such as moving the headquarters, closing production locations, or cutting employee salaries. This unprecedented arrangement, designed to address national security concerns, will transfer to the Treasury and Commerce Departments after Trump leaves office. The move has been described as giving the president a startling degree of personal power over a major corporation.</p>

          <p>Podcast host Joe Rogan has responded to threats made by influencer Brian Johnson, known as the Liver King, who was recently arrested for making terroristic threats against him. According to legal documents, Rogan told detectives he considered Johnson's social media posts threatening and believes the influencer is "significantly unstable and seems like he needs help." Johnson, who traveled to Austin to confront Rogan, has since been released from jail but continues to post videos about his intention to fight. Rogan stated he has never had any interaction with Johnson and was unsure why he was being targeted by the influencer.</p>
