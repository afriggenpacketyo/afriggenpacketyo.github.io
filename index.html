          <p>Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the party pending an investigation into recent comments she made regarding racism. The suspension, which means she will now sit as an independent MP, follows an interview where she reiterated controversial views previously expressed in 2023. In the interview, she distinguished between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice, a stance that has drawn criticism, including from Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Abbott maintains her comments were factually correct and claims the Labour leadership is attempting to force her out.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has recommended a sentence of one day in prison for Brett Hankison, a former police officer convicted of using excessive force during the 2020 raid that led to Breonna Taylor's death. Hankison fired shots into Taylor's apartment that entered a neighboring unit, though he was not the officer who shot Taylor. Attorneys for Taylor's family have condemned the recommendation as an "insult" and a "betrayal of the jury's decision," arguing it sends a message that officers can violate civil rights with impunity. A federal judge will make the final sentencing decision.</p>

While not a traditional trade item, its inclusion on the agenda could serve as a key point of leverage in broader bilateral talks.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured Alcatraz Island as part of the Trump administration's initiative to potentially reopen the site as a federal penitentiary. The directive aims to house the nation's "most ruthless and violent offenders" in a rebuilt facility. The plan has drawn sharp criticism from California leaders, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who cite the immense cost and the loss of significant tourism revenue. Alcatraz, a popular National Park Service site, closed as a prison in 1963 due to high operating costs.</p>

The NCAA had previously denied UCLA's waiver request for Robinson.

However, Newsom's plan faces significant legal and procedural hurdles, as California voters previously gave the power of redistricting to an independent commission.

In response, Netflix raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling confidence in its business strategy. While the company no longer releases quarterly subscriber numbers, it noted healthy membership growth and expects its ad business to continue expanding.

          <p>Following the White House's announcement of President Trump's diagnosis, this article explains chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The condition occurs when veins in the legs are unable to effectively pump blood back to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling, achiness, and varicose veins. While it is a common and often benign condition, particularly in older adults, doctors must first rule out more serious causes like heart disease or blood clots. Treatment for CVI typically involves lifestyle changes such as wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs, and exercising to strengthen leg muscles.</p>

          <p>Maine State Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy in connection with the death of 48-year-old Sunshine Stewart, who was found dead in Crawford Pond earlier this month. Stewart had been on a solo paddleboarding trip and her death was ruled a homicide caused by strangulation and blunt force trauma. Police have not released the suspect's identity or a potential motive for the killing. The arrest has brought a sense of relief to the local community of Union, where residents had been concerned following the violent and mysterious death.</p>

          <p>To celebrate its 70th anniversary, Disneyland has debuted a new attraction featuring a highly realistic audio-animatronic figure of Walt Disney himself. Housed in the Main Street Opera House, the show, "Walt Disney — A Magical Life," aims to present the company's origins through the vision of its founder. The creation of the animatronic has been a topic of curiosity and debate, with Imagineers striving for accuracy while some, including Disney's granddaughter, have raised concerns about preserving a human legacy as a robot. The figure's movements are noted for their subtlety and fluidity, representing a significant step in animatronic technology.</p>

          <p>Ian Cleary has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a fellow student at Gettysburg College in 2013, a decade after the incident occurred. His accuser, Shannon Keeler, had long pursued justice and renewed her efforts after receiving a 2019 Facebook message from his account stating, "So I raped you." Cleary, who was extradited from France in 2024 to face the charges, entered the plea in a Pennsylvania court. As part of the agreement, a sentence of four to eight years has been proposed, which a judge will consider at a hearing in October.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has tightened the federal permitting process for solar and wind energy projects on U.S.-owned lands, giving the Interior Secretary final approval authority. An internal memo states that Secretary Doug Burgum will now have the last word on all aspects of the permitting process for these renewable projects. The Interior Department framed the move as "levelling the playing field" with fossil fuels, but renewable industry groups have condemned it as politically motivated obstruction. This policy change adds new layers of bureaucracy that critics say will slow the growth of clean energy production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has launched a sustained social media campaign criticizing President Trump and his administration over the decision not to release additional files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Using his platform X, Musk has posted and reposted numerous attacks, accusing the administration of a "cover up" and questioning the official narrative of Epstein's death. This comes after the administration angered many Trump supporters by not fulfilling an earlier promise to release more documents. The White House has not directly responded to Musk, but stated that the president and his team are in contact with supporters on both sides of the aisle.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has secured an agreement to access a federal database containing the personal information of millions of Medicaid recipients. According to documents, the purpose is to use addresses, social security numbers, and other data to find and locate non-citizens. The move has been condemned by critics like Rep. Pramila Jayapal as a "weaponization of data," as it gives ICE access to the information of 79 million low-income Americans. The Trump administration defended the agreement as a measure to prevent fraud, while critics warn it could deter people, including citizens and eligible immigrants, from seeking necessary medical care.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has acquitted former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, overturning his 2017 fraud conviction after a nine-year legal battle. Johnson was accused of "front-running" a large currency trade for a client in 2011, a practice his defense and industry groups argued was standard pre-hedging to manage bank risk. Johnson, who served time in both U.S. and UK prisons, was able to launch a new appeal after a law used in his prosecution was overturned. His lawyer stated that justice has finally been achieved in a case that should never have been brought.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the history of air travel, arguing that the "golden age" of flying was more of a myth than a reality and that the experience has always been somewhat difficult. While modern air travel is characterized by cramped seats, extra fees, and security theater, early aviation was dangerous, uncomfortable, and lacked basic amenities. The author posits that the perceived glamour was tied to the novelty and wonder of flight itself, a miracle that has since become mundane. The article concludes that the transformation of a technological marvel into a tedious form of mass transit is a natural cycle for any innovation.</p>
