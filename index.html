          <p>U.S. sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson will not compete in the 200m event at the upcoming World Championships after narrowly missing the final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships. She finished fourth in her heat, just one-hundredth of a second behind the last qualifier. This development concludes a difficult week for the 25-year-old athlete, who was arrested days earlier over a domestic violence allegation involving her boyfriend. Richardson still holds a bye to compete in the 100m event at the championships as the defending champion.</p>

The Palestinian health ministry attributed his death to fires allegedly set by Israeli settlers on homes and vehicles. The U.S. State Department condemned the "criminal violence by any party" and is providing consular assistance to the family. This incident marks the second death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank in three weeks, occurring amid escalating violence in the region since the October 7th Hamas attack.</p>

Hamilton reaffirmed his commitment to racing and dismissed rumors of an early exit from the sport, stating he is looking forward to the next race after the summer break.

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democrats reportedly negotiated for the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees. The requested funds included money for the National Institutes of Health, the World Food Program, and other global aid initiatives. Sources indicate a deal was close to being reached to confirm around 20 nominees, but President Trump ultimately rejected the agreement. The negotiations highlight the intense political maneuvering over funding and appointments before the Senate's August recess.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic state legislators has fled Texas to break the legislative quorum and block a special session aimed at passing a new congressional map. The proposed Republican-backed map could create up to five new GOP-leaning districts, a move supported by President Donald Trump. This action is a last-ditch effort to run out the clock on the 30-day special session, though it cannot permanently stop the bill. The Texas Attorney General has suggested that the fleeing lawmakers should be arrested, echoing similar high-stakes political standoffs in the state's recent history.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office, earning $40 million in its second weekend. However, this represents a steep 66% decline from its strong debut, a more significant drop than other recent Marvel films. The film's global total has reached $369 million. Following behind were two new comedy releases, "The Bad Guys 2" which opened with $22 million, and "The Naked Gun" which earned $17 million. Analysts note that while the summer box office started strong, its overall success will depend on the sustained performance of upcoming releases.</p>

          <p>Smoke from hundreds of active wildfires in Canada is drifting south, causing hazy skies and poor air quality across several states in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, leading to air quality alerts in states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. Health officials are advising residents, especially sensitive individuals, to limit outdoor activities due to the increased pollution. Forecasters predict that the wind patterns driving the smoke into the U.S. could persist, potentially prolonging the air quality issues for some time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, though payouts will be limited following a recent Supreme Court ruling. The court found that hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful but could be deemed unfair if excessively high. The FCA plans to run a scheme, estimated to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, to compensate affected customers for agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator will consult on the details, but it is anticipated that individuals will likely receive less than £950 per deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has again drawn international condemnation after leading prayers at Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a sensitive holy site. This act is the latest in a long history of provocative actions by the ultranationalist leader, who has prior convictions for racism and supporting a terrorist group. Once a fringe political figure, Ben-Gvir has risen to become one of Israel's most influential politicians, advocating for greater Jewish access to the contested site and a hardline stance in the Gaza war. His actions continue to escalate tensions in the already volatile region.</p>

          <p>A volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, Krasheninnikov, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky.

Russian authorities reported that the ash was spreading eastward over the Pacific Ocean and did not immediately threaten populated areas. While there is some discrepancy about the exact date of its last eruption, experts agree this is the first historically confirmed event in centuries for this particular volcano.</p>
