          <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that taking full control of Hulu will unlock a new level of growth for the company, particularly in its streaming business. Disney finalized its acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu, resolving a long-standing dispute over the platform's valuation. Iger emphasized the benefits of bundling Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN into a single, seamless experience for consumers, which is expected to drive higher engagement and lower churn. The integration of Hulu strengthens Disney's direct-to-consumer business, potentially leading to long-term revenue and profit growth, as well as the company's strong theme park business.

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines arrived in the Los Angeles area to support the National Guard in responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and Marines for law enforcement purposes on city streets. The lawsuit argues that the presence of soldiers causes irreparable damage to Los Angeles and the state. The U.S. Northern Command stated that the Marines would "seamlessly integrate" with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, and they have received training in de-escalation and crowd control.</p>

          <p>A major international study involving nearly 300,000 children revealed a connection between screen time and emotional well-being. The study found that children who spend more time on devices are at a higher risk of developing aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, and vice versa. Time spent on gaming consoles was particularly linked to a greater chance of developing issues. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting recreational screen time for children between 2 and 5 years old, emphasizing that screens should not be the sole outlet for managing emotions.</p>

          <p>The spin-off film "Ballerina," set in the John Wick universe, initially struggles to capture the essence of the original series, focusing too heavily on a generic revenge plot.

However, "Ballerina" eventually succeeds by expanding the Wick canon, introducing bizarre and engaging scenarios such as a cultish mountain town where every inhabitant is out to kill Eve.

Louie is trained to alert 17-year-old Ellie Lynn's family when she is about to have an epileptic seizure.
