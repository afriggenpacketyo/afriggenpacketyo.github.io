            <p>Community members in Pacific Palisades returned to the site of the Community United Methodist Church, which burned down in January during Southern California wildfires, to commemorate Good Friday and Easter. Pastor John Shaver, who lost his home in the fire, emphasized the church's resilience as a "community without walls" and its commitment to rebuilding. Inspired by the Chautauqua movement, the church has been a cornerstone of the community for over a century. Despite the devastation, the congregation continues services at other locations, incorporating saved artifacts into the new church design.</p>

            <p>Romany Gypsy women discuss the challenges of revealing their heritage due to negative stereotypes and discrimination. Many feel pressured to hide their identity in professional and public spaces to avoid prejudice. A survey indicates that a significant percentage of people would be uncomfortable employing a Gypsy or traveler.

            <p>Hereditary peers in the House of Lords are preparing to leave parliament as the government moves to abolish their inherited right to legislate. The peers reflect on their families' long history in politics, the changing nature of the House of Lords, and the impact of the upcoming changes. While some acknowledge the need for reform, others defend the value of hereditary peers and their long-term perspective. The move marks a significant shift in the composition and legitimacy of the upper chamber of the British parliament.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an ACLU emergency appeal. The court ordered the Trump administration not to remove individuals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. The ACLU argued that the deportations would violate due process rights, potentially sending individuals to dangerous foreign prisons. The White House responded, claiming those detained were "foreign terrorists," and expressed confidence in prevailing against the legal challenges.</p>

VioGén uses 35 questions to assess the likelihood of repeat domestic violence and categorize the threat level, informing police resource allocation. Critics argue that the algorithm leads to police abdicating decision-making to technology and that it has not been independently audited. This case raises concerns about the effectiveness and potential biases of algorithms used in domestic violence risk assessment.</p>
