          <p>Reports indicate that dozens of Palestinians were killed and many more wounded while attempting to access food at a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution center. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reports at least 27 fatalities and over 160 injuries due to shootings, marking the third consecutive day of violence near the U.S.- and Israeli-backed GHF hub. The Israeli military stated that its troops fired warning shots after identifying suspects deviating from designated routes, while GHF asserts its operations continued safely within secure areas. Volker TÃ¼rk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called for an impartial investigation into the deaths and condemned the militarized aid distribution system. The situation underscores the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the challenges of delivering aid safely to civilians. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. scientists are expressing concerns that budget cuts and immigration restrictions under the Trump administration will lead to a significant brain drain. As the United States reduces funding for research and imposes stricter immigration policies, countries like China and those in Europe are offering researchers more attractive opportunities with increased funding and greater stability. This shift could result in a loss of talent and innovation for the United States as scientists seek more supportive environments elsewhere. The concerns highlight the potential long-term consequences of current U.S. policies on the scientific community and the nation's global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Following Joe Biden's announcement of his cancer diagnosis, Donald Trump initially offered a message of sympathy and support. However, Trump soon reverted to attacking Biden, promoting conspiracy theories about Biden's health, and comparing the former president to a corpse. Trump's shift in tone included questioning the timing of the announcement and suggesting Biden was taken advantage of while in office due to cognitive impairment. Others in Trump's circle also made disparaging remarks about Biden's health, reflecting a broader pattern of attacks despite the initial expression of sympathy.</p>

While NOAA plans to rehire some employees, multiple forecast offices are critically understaffed, potentially limiting their ability to provide timely warnings.

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after her disappearance in 2007. The search, prompted by German prosecutors, covers 21 plots of land between the resort where McCann disappeared and where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, was staying at the time. BrÃ¼ckner, currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate crime, has been identified as the prime suspect in McCann's disappearance, though he denies any involvement. Authorities are taking one last look in places where evidence or a body could have been hidden.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects a significant slowdown in U.S. economic growth due to the Trump administration's tariffs and policy uncertainty. GDP growth is expected to decline to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, down from 2.8% last year. The report cites new tariffs as a primary cause, increasing the effective tariff rate to 15.4%, the highest since 1938.

While the WHO suspects increased transmissibility due to mutations, there is no evidence of more severe disease.
