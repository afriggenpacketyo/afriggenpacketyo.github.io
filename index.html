          <p>This article details the schedule for Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK, hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The visit, which is unusual for a second-term US president, will include a formal welcome, a state banquet, and a meeting with the prime minister at Chequers to discuss a UK-US trade deal. The trip is also expected to draw significant protests organized by the "Stop Trump" coalition, which has called for the visit's cancellation over various policy disagreements. Security will be extensive, with police planning airspace restrictions for the duration of the visit.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, titled "Wohnkomplex," examines the cultural and social legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete housing blocks common in the former East Germany. Initially promoted as a socialist utopia to solve post-war housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of dystopia and social transformation following German reunification, associated with unemployment and rising extremism. The exhibition uses art to explore these multifaceted narratives, reflecting the collective memory of millions who lived in these complexes and prompting a re-evaluation of this divisive architectural heritage. It aims to foster understanding of a significant period in the country's history.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," profiles twelve Chinese individuals whose lives were shaped by their experiences in the United States, highlighting a past era of optimism in bilateral relations. Co-editors Deborah Davis and Terry Lautz argue that as the U.S. and China now find themselves in a period of intense competition, these stories serve as a reminder of the shared interests and benefits that once arose from cooperation. The book explores how figures from science, diplomacy, and the arts adapted their American experiences to contribute to China's modernization, underscoring a period of mutual understanding that has since faded away.</p>

          <p>Nikos Michaloliakos, the convicted leader of Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, has been released from prison to serve the remainder of his 13-year sentence under house arrest on health grounds. Michaloliakos was convicted in 2020 for running a criminal organization responsible for violent attacks on immigrants and political opponents, including the murder of an anti-fascist musician. The decision by a judicial council to grant his early release has sparked outrage among left-wing parties, who argue it sends a message of impunity for hate and fascism and undermines the struggle for justice in the country.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel drew scrutiny for incorrectly announcing that a suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was in custody, only to retract the statement less than two hours later. The misstep occurred during a tense 33-hour manhunt and led to public confusion, as Utah law enforcement officials were simultaneously stating that the gunman remained at large.

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States, has been recalled from his post after newly revealed emails showed the extent of his supportive friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The emails, sent after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor, expressed strong support and suggested the conviction was unjust, contradicting the British government's understanding of the relationship at the time of Mandelson's appointment. The scandal marks Mandelson's third forced departure from a government position and creates a diplomatic crisis for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, especially ahead of a state visit from President Trump.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill that would permit colleges and universities to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. Authored by Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, the legislation is part of a broader package of bills aimed at addressing the legacy of slavery and systemic racism. Supporters argue the bill is narrowly tailored to focus on lineage rather than race to comply with Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action. However, opponents contend that lineage serves as a proxy for race and the measure will likely face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, historians are drawing parallels between the current polarized political environment in the United States and the tumultuous 1850s that preceded the Civil War. Scholars point to similarities such as spasms of political violence, widespread disillusionment with the Supreme Court, and deep sectional divisions, which they liken to modern polarization. While emphasizing that the country is not on the brink of another civil war, they express concern over the paranoid reactions to violence and the rise of paramilitary-like political movements, which echo the volatile dynamics of the antebellum period.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that President Biden's decision to run for a second term, after positioning himself as a "bridge" to the next generation in 2020, ultimately became a roadblock for his party. The article references Kamala Harris's upcoming book, "107 Days," which highlights the limited time she had to campaign after Biden stepped aside, suggesting his late withdrawal put his successor at a significant disadvantage. The author contends that Biden's choice drained energy from the party and prevented potential candidates like Harris and others from engaging in a normal primary process, framing the 2024 loss as a consequence of this decision.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica, California, has declared a state of fiscal distress, citing a combination of post-pandemic economic struggles and massive legal costs. The city has already paid $229 million to settle sexual abuse claims against a former police dispatcher, Eric Uller, and still faces 180 additional claims. This financial strain is compounded by declining tourism and retail revenues, prompting concerns among city employees about potential budget cuts and layoffs.

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the right to freedom of expression by deleting the Instagram account of well-known adult film actress Esperanza Gómez. The Constitutional Court found that the company removed her account, which had over five million followers, without clear justification and applied its nudity policies inconsistently compared to other similar accounts. The ruling states that social media posts are constitutionally protected and ordered Meta to create more transparent mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions, marking a significant decision on content moderation and user rights.</p>

          <p>Boxing experts are offering split predictions for the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford's supporters point to his technical brilliance, adaptability, and reach advantage, believing he can outbox the aging Canelo and win on points, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those backing Álvarez argue that his size, power, and experience at super-middleweight will be insurmountable for Crawford, predicting that Canelo's strength and ability to control the fight's pace will ultimately lead him to victory in the Las Vegas showdown.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim prime minister, the first woman to hold the position. The "GenZ" protests erupted after the government imposed a social media ban but quickly grew to address broader economic grievances, leading to the dissolution of parliament. With Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, now in charge, calm has returned to Kathmandu and new elections have been scheduled for March 5th, marking a pivotal moment for the nation.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative aimed at both boosting birth rates and retaining scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after having a child. The program, initially launching at the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 new mothers who hold doctoral degrees. This policy attempts to address two of China's major priorities by providing targeted support to women in a critical professional field, encouraging them to continue their careers after starting families.</p>

          <p>An American woman recently released from Taliban custody has issued an urgent plea for an elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who remain imprisoned in Afghanistan. Faye Hall, who was arrested with the couple in February, stated that the pair are "literally dying" due to rapidly deteriorating health in harsh prison conditions. The couple, aged 80 and 76, have lived in Afghanistan for years running a charity but still do not know the reason for their detention. The UN has called their detention "inhumane," and their family fears they will not survive without immediate medical intervention.</p>

          <p>NATO is strengthening its eastern flank after Poland reported an incursion of 19 Russian drones into its airspace, an incident Warsaw described as a deliberate provocation. In response, Denmark, France, and Germany have committed fighter jets and a warship to a new mission aimed at enhancing the military alliance's air defense capabilities in the region. The incursion marks the most serious incident of its kind since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, significantly escalating tensions and prompting NATO allies to reaffirm their commitment to defending every inch of the alliance's territory.</p>

          <p>A potential friendly match between Portugal and the United States next March could mark Cristiano Ronaldo's first appearance in the U.S. in over a decade, fueling speculation about the reasons for his long absence. The article suggests his avoidance of the U.S. may be linked to a sexual assault allegation from 2009, which was legally resolved but could have created public relations and legal risks. A return under the Trump administration, which has shown favor to Ronaldo, could be seen as a strategic move to re-engage with the American market ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>

The U.S. and Britain described the transit as a routine freedom of navigation operation in international waters. A spokesman for China's Eastern Theater Command stated that the action undermined regional peace and stability and affirmed that its forces remain on high alert to safeguard national sovereignty.

          <p>A new border wall erected as part of a demarcation process between Armenia and Azerbaijan has physically divided the Armenian village of Kirants, creating economic and emotional hardship for its residents. Based on Soviet-era maps, the new border has resulted in some villagers losing their homes and farmers losing access to their lands, which are now on the Azerbaijani side. While the wall has brought a tense calm to a region historically marked by conflict, with no shots fired since its construction, residents remain anxious about the future and mourn the loss of what they consider their homeland.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, Rebecca Solnit argues that the culture of sexual exploitation revealed by the Jeffrey Epstein scandal was a widespread and normalized part of society in the decades before modern feminism shifted public consciousness. She recounts how the 1970s and 80s saw the romanticization and trivialization of adult men's sexual relationships with teenage girls in movies, music, and mainstream culture. Solnit contends that feminism was instrumental in challenging this patriarchal status quo by establishing the principles of consent, exposing power dynamics, and denormalizing abuses like child abuse and sexual assault.</p>
