            <p>A soccer coach in the San Fernando Valley, 43-year-old Mario Edguardo Garcia-Aquino, has been charged with the murder of 13-year-old Oscar Omar Hernandez, who was reported missing on March 30th. Hernandez's body was discovered in Oxnard, near Leo Carrillo State Beach. Garcia-Aquino also faces a felony count of assault with intent to commit a lewd act against a 16-year-old boy from an alleged incident in February 2024. Authorities are urging any other potential victims or anyone with information to come forward, and are assuring undocumented individuals that their immigration status will not be questioned if they provide information.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily stayed a lower court order that would have required the Trump administration to bring Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador, back to the United States. Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 protective order that should have prevented his removal. The Justice Department argued that the order requiring his return infringes on the President's foreign diplomacy powers. The Supreme Court will use this time to further consider the matter.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the country doesn't withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory 34% import fee on American products. This action escalates the trade war between the two nations, potentially leading to a combined U.S. tariff of 104% on Chinese goods. Economists warn that these tariffs could reignite inflation and negatively impact economic growth. Trump also mentioned plans to start trade negotiations with other nations, including Japan, and complained that they have treated the U.S. poorly on trade.</p>

This approach has shown promising results, with reduced GP visits, A&E attendances, and hospital admissions.
