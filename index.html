        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Severe flash flooding in northern West Virginia, triggered by intense rainfall, has resulted in at least eight fatalities, including a young child, and one person remains missing. Officials reported that parts of Wheeling and Ohio County received 2.5 to 4 inches of rain in approximately 30 minutes, overwhelming local infrastructure and waterways. The governor has declared a state of emergency in Ohio and Marion counties and is coordinating with FEMA to provide assistance. The rapid and unexpected nature of the flooding caused significant damage to roads and bridges, hampering rescue efforts, while similar heavy downpours in San Antonio earlier in the week also caused numerous fatalities.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a retrial that captured national attention. Read was also acquitted of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene but was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, resulting in a one-year probation order. The trial, which spawned significant media coverage including a Hulu show and a Netflix documentary, saw Read's defense argue she was framed for O'Keefe's death. Supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate her acquittal, while witnesses expressed dismay, calling the outcome a miscarriage of justice.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved attack plans targeting Iran but has not made a final decision on whether to proceed, citing the possibility of Tehran abandoning its nuclear program. This decision comes as Israel has been conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, with the U.S. assisting in intercepting retaliatory missile strikes. Iran has stated it will not negotiate under duress and has prepared missiles targeting U.S. bases in the Middle East should the U.S. join the Israeli campaign. Trump has indicated his patience is wearing thin, while Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.</p>

          <p>The El Segundo Unified School District lost its appeal and must pay $1 million to a former middle school student who sued for failing to protect her from bullying. The appeals court upheld the jury's verdict, finding the district negligent in supervising and training its employees, contributing to the harm suffered by the student. The bullying, which included verbal and cyber harassment, began after the student asked a friend if she could date her ex-boyfriend. The court found that school employees did not follow basic bullying procedures and guidelines, leading to the ruling against the district.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that official U.S. records significantly underestimate mortality and life expectancy disparities for Native Americans. The research indicates that the life expectancy of American Indian and Alaska Native populations is 6.5 years lower than the national average, a gap nearly three times greater than reported by the CDC. The study also found that 41% of AI/AN deaths were incorrectly classified, predominantly misrecorded as "White," skewing official statistics.

          <p>A majority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers is being sold in what is expected to be the most expensive sale of a U.S. sports team in history, with a valuation of at least $10 billion. Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and controlling owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is reportedly the buyer. Jeanie Buss will continue to serve as team governor, but her family will no longer own a controlling stake in the team. Magic Johnson expressed enthusiasm about the sale, stating that Walter will carry on the team's legacy.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it is maintaining its benchmark interest rate, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach amid uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's economic policies. The central bank anticipates inflation to worsen in the coming months but still projects two interest rate cuts by year-end. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the strength of the economy but noted potential inflationary pressures from new tariffs. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%, emphasizing the need to assess the impact of tariffs before considering rate adjustments.

          <p>The State Department has issued new guidelines for more extensive social media vetting of international student visa applicants, instructing consular officers to look for signs of "hostility" toward the United States. Applicants will be asked to set all social media accounts to "public," with failure to do so potentially seen as evasive. U.S. officials will be looking for indications of hostility toward American citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles. These new guidelines are part of an effort to ensure proper screening and enhance the safety of the U.S. and its universities.</p>

          <p>A disagreement between President Trump and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard over Iran's nuclear capabilities highlights divisions within the administration and echoes past debates surrounding the Iraq War. While Gabbard maintains that U.S. intelligence agencies do not believe Iran is building a nuclear weapon, Trump asserts that Iran is "very close" to having one. This divergence has fueled a rift within Trump's "America First" movement, with some warning against military intervention and drawing parallels to the flawed intelligence used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The situation reflects broader tensions over U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Aaron Spolin, a Westside lawyer, has agreed to be disbarred for misleading prisoners and their families about their chances of release. Spolin pleaded no contest to misconduct involving eight clients, promoting false hopes that their sentences would be reduced when it was highly unlikely. He charged fees of up to $30,000 for services with little to no chance of success, exploiting families with limited means. The State Bar's top prosecutor stated that Spolin's conduct warranted disbarment, and he is also the subject of a parallel criminal investigation by the state Attorney General’s office.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied President Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers represent him in his appeal of the $83 million defamation case filed by columnist E. Jean Carroll. The court rejected the argument that Trump's alleged conduct fell within the scope of his role as president, thus not warranting DOJ representation. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24. This decision means American taxpayers will not be paying for Trump's ongoing appeal in this case.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold, following his move to Real Madrid, had a mixed debut, showing both promise and areas for improvement. Initially, he was caught out of position on multiple occasions, leading to Al-Hilal creating opportunities. However, he contributed to Real's goal by cutting out a pass, and his passing accuracy improved throughout the game. By the time he was substituted, he had played more crosses and entered the final third more than any of his teammates. Despite these positives, he also lost possession of the ball more times than anyone else on the team.</p>

As Trump contemplates military action against Iran, Gabbard's stance has become a hindrance, leading to her exclusion from key meetings.</p>

The call between the leaders was initiated by Trump, who has repeatedly asserted the U.S. played a significant role in the ceasefire.
