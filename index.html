          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago O'Hare veered off the runway and onto the grass at Boston's Logan Airport. The Airbus A220 experienced the incident while turning off the runway. Emergency vehicles responded to the scene, but there were no reported injuries among the passengers. Runway 33-L was temporarily closed for assessment, and passengers were bused to the terminal, with the FAA issuing a ground stop for departures, causing delays averaging 30 minutes or more. Optimism can be found in the fact that no one was hurt and that the issue was handled effectively by airport personnel.</p>

          <p>An Air India plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, India, killing at least 200 people, but one British passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, survived. Ramesh, who was in seat 11A, contacted his family to report he was "fine" but was concerned about his brother who was also on the plane. The flight, bound for London Gatwick, carried 242 passengers and crew, including 53 Britons, 169 Indian nationals, seven Portuguese nationals, and one Canadian. The crash prompted reactions from global leaders, including King Charles and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, and triggered crisis teams in both India and the UK.</p>

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the remaining charge of third-degree sexual assault against Jessica Mann, due to an irreconcilable disagreement among jurors. This development followed a partial verdict where Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola. Tensions among the jurors, including allegations of threats, contributed to the mistrial, though Mann remains ready for a third trial. Weinstein is already appealing his 2022 sexual assault conviction in Los Angeles, where he received a 16-year sentence, as this case adds another layer to his ongoing legal battles.</p>

          <p>Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented from a Supreme Court decision limiting the U.S. Tax Court's authority in certain IRS cases, arguing it empowers the IRS to evade accountability. The case, *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Zuch*, involved Jennifer Zuch's dispute with the IRS over a misapplied payment. Gorsuch contended that the ruling prevents taxpayers like Zuch from recovering overpayments and allows the IRS to avoid review in Tax Court, effectively shielding the agency from addressing its errors. The majority opinion held that the Tax Court lacked jurisdiction because there was no longer a levy on Zuch's property.</p>

Trump claimed that cutting rates by two percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion annually. This attack follows similar remarks from other administration officials who have pressured the Fed to ease monetary policy. Markets remained largely unmoved by Trump's comments, with traders pricing in little chance of a rate cut in the near term, despite recent economic data calming fears about inflation.

          <p>Almost all members of the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board have resigned, citing political interference by the Trump administration. The former board members allege that the administration denied awards to selected individuals and subjected foreign Fulbright recipients to unauthorized reviews. They claim these actions contradict the Fulbright mission and values, including free speech and academic freedom. The State Department disputes these claims, stating the board members were partisan appointees and that the President has the authority to ensure foreign policy initiatives align with national interests.</p>

          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which allows users to create nonconsensual, sexualized images using AI technology. The Hong Kong-based company ran ads on Facebook and Instagram to promote the app, violating Meta's policies against adult nudity, sexual activity, and harassment. Meta took legal action after multiple attempts by Joy Timeline to circumvent its ad review process. The company is also updating its enforcement methods and sharing signals with other tech companies to address the spread of nudify apps.</p>
