        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a dramatic return to Test cricket, England's Jofra Archer electrified the crowd at Lord's by taking a key wicket early in his spell against India after a four-year injury layoff. The second day of the match saw fortunes swing, as England's Joe Root not only scored a magnificent century but also set a new record for the most catches by an English outfielder. However, India's Jasprit Bumrah delivered an influential performance of his own, claiming five wickets to disrupt England's batting lineup and restrict their first-innings total to 387. India concluded the day's play at 145-3, trailing by 242 runs and setting the stage for a compelling continuation of the contest.</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is in an escalating conflict with the Unite union regarding her involvement in the Birmingham bin strikes. The union announced it had suspended Rayner's membership for urging striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run council, though a Labour source claims she had already quit, calling the move a "silly stunt." This public rift highlights broader tensions between the Labour government and one of its largest union backers over issues like welfare cuts and workers' rights. The dispute threatens a significant financial and political relationship, as Unite is a major affiliate and funder of the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>President Trump traveled to Kerr County, Texas, to assess the damage from catastrophic flash floods that have resulted in over 120 deaths and more than 170 people missing. The visit includes meetings with local officials, first responders, and families affected by the disaster, which severely impacted a girls' summer camp where at least 27 died. The president has signed a disaster declaration, enabling federal assistance for the ongoing search and recovery efforts. The floods, described as a "hundred-year catastrophe," occurred with extreme rapidity, leaving communities devastated as search teams continue to comb through debris for survivors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tax bill introduces a temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000, but includes a phase-out for high earners that could create a significant tax surprise. This "SALT torpedo" effect occurs as the deduction is reduced for those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000. Tax professionals warn that this quirky provision could result in an artificially high effective federal tax rate, potentially reaching 45.5% on income within that specific range. Experts advise taxpayers near this income threshold to seek professional advice and consider strategies to manage their income levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widely adopted goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the "Manpo-kei," or "10,000 step meter." While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent studies have shown that significant health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower counts like 2,500 steps. Many health experts still endorse the 10,000-step target as it aligns with general physical activity guidelines of about 150 minutes per week and provides a simple, actionable goal for patients. Ultimately, researchers emphasize that consistency and intensity are key, and any amount of walking is better than none.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its most severe measles outbreak since 1992, with over 1,297 confirmed cases in 2025, surpassing the total for all of 2019. Health experts warn that the summer travel season is likely to accelerate the spread of the highly contagious disease, which has already caused three deaths this year. The rise in cases is attributed to declining vaccination rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted routine immunizations and amplified anti-vaccine sentiment. Officials are urging the public to ensure their MMR vaccinations are up-to-date, as this remains the most effective protection against measles and its potentially severe complications.</p>

One article reviews a book on Argentina's Dirty War, highlighting how the state-sponsored atrocities of the past offer cautionary tales for any society, including the U.S., where checks on state power erode. Another piece discusses a history of the Western Hemisphere, suggesting that democratic concepts like birthright citizenship were pioneered in Latin America, upending the view of the U.S. as a sole guiding force. These perspectives argue that the U.S. is not immune to authoritarianism and has much to learn from global experiences.</p>

          <p>A 2025 analysis has identified the most expensive states in the U.S., with California ranking as the costliest, followed by Hawaii, Florida, and Colorado. The study considers a range of factors, including the price of goods, housing affordability, and the rapidly increasing cost of homeowner's insurance. In California, nearly 40% of households are cost-burdened, spending over a third of their income on housing. States like Florida and Louisiana are grappling with an insurance crisis driven by extreme weather, leading to the nation's highest premiums. These high living costs present a significant challenge for residents and for companies seeking to attract and retain employees in these states. (not investment advice)</p>

Modeling suggests the uptick is concentrated in the Southeast, Southern, and West Coast states, with emergency room visits for the virus reaching their highest levels since February in some regions. A recent CDC analysis concluded that the virus has settled into a biannual surge pattern, driven by genetic changes in its spike protein. This rise in COVID-19 coincides with an unusual increase in another respiratory illness, parvovirus B19, prompting health officials to monitor both situations closely.</p>

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. Credit counseling and debt management plans can help by negotiating lower interest rates with creditors, making payments more manageable without reducing the principal balance. For those already behind on payments, credit card debt forgiveness programs may allow for settling debts for a fraction of the amount owed, though this can impact credit scores. Additionally, many lenders offer hardship programs with temporary relief, and in cases of overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can offer legal protection and a chance to discharge or restructure what is owed.</p>

He led the UK's largest police force from 2005 to 2008, a tenure that included overseeing the response to the 7/7 London bombings. His leadership was also marked by controversy, particularly the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was mistaken for a terror suspect. Although cleared of personal wrongdoing, the incident led to sustained pressure, and he stepped down in 2008 after losing the support of London's then-mayor, Boris Johnson.

          <p>Missouri's governor, Mike Kehoe, has signed a bill repealing a voter-approved law that guaranteed paid sick leave and inflation-adjusted minimum wage increases. The repeal, which takes effect in August, is a significant victory for business groups who argued the mandate was burdensome, and a major setback for workers' rights advocates. The original law, passed by ballot measure eight months ago, allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Advocates have called the governor's action a "betrayal" to families and are already proposing a new ballot initiative to reinstate the benefits, this time as a constitutional amendment.</p>

          <p>Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt is recording an audio-only special, "Black Coffee and Ice Water," set to be released on Audible later this year. He explained that he chose the audio format out of nostalgia for comedy albums and a desire to create more physical media, with plans to release his specials on vinyl. In an interview, Oswalt discussed how the special will explore his experiences with sadness and confusion in these rapidly changing times. He also shared insights on parenting a teenager, reflecting on the circular nature of family dynamics and how his daughter enjoys spending time with him but is also always "slightly disappointed" in him.</p>

          <p>World Boxing Association lightweight champion Gervonta 'Tank' Davis was arrested in Florida on a domestic violence charge of battery causing bodily harm. The arrest stems from a June incident where he allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend during a confrontation while picking up their children. According to the police report, Davis struck the woman in the head and slapped her face, causing a minor injury. This incident adds to Davis's history of legal issues, which includes a previous domestic battery charge and jail time for a hit-and-run crash. He is currently being held without bond in a Miami-Dade County correctional center.</p>

          <p>Individuals living on Social Security can qualify for credit card debt forgiveness, but the process has unique considerations. While a fixed, low income can make it easier to demonstrate the financial hardship required for negotiation, the ability to save up for a lump-sum settlement can be a significant challenge. A key advantage for recipients is that Social Security benefits are legally protected from garnishment by most creditors, which can provide significant leverage in settlement talks. However, before pursuing this path, individuals should assess their cash flow, consider the stress of ongoing collections, and compare alternatives like debt management or credit counseling to find the best fit.</p>

          <p>Iranian authorities have confirmed the arrest of an 18-year-old Franco-German citizen who disappeared in mid-June while on a round-the-world cycling trip. Iran's Foreign Minister stated the teenager, Lennart Monterlos, was detained for "committing a crime" but did not provide specifics. French officials have been granted consular access, and Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has urged Tehran not to "persecute the innocent." The arrest highlights ongoing tensions, as Western nations accuse Iran of engaging in "hostage diplomacy" by detaining foreign nationals on dubious charges to use as bargaining chips. Both France and Germany strongly advise their citizens against traveling to Iran due to the high risk of arbitrary arrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>High-yield savings accounts continue to offer competitive interest rates, often exceeding 4.30%, making them an attractive option for savers in the current economic climate. A major advantage is the flexibility they provide, allowing easy access to funds without the penalties associated with CDs, which is valuable amid economic uncertainty. However, a key drawback is that these high rates are variable and may fall sooner than expected, as banks could preemptively lower them ahead of anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Savers should also be aware that the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a shift for those accustomed to traditional branch banking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly changes the federal student loan system, reducing the number of repayment plans and setting new borrowing caps. The legislation phases out existing plans like SAVE and introduces two new options for future borrowers: a standard 10-to-25-year plan and a new income-driven plan with a repayment term of up to 30 years. The law also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants and eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new students starting in 2026. While the White House says these changes simplify a broken system, some advocates express concern that extending repayment timelines could force borrowers to stay in debt for longer.</p>

The recent passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is expected to increase the federal deficit, is also seen as a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency.

The piece suggests that the intense focus on the Epstein files is fueled by social media algorithms and confirmation bias.

          <p>A 2025 analysis of living costs across the U.S. has identified the nation's most affordable states, with West Virginia ranking as the cheapest. Following West Virginia are Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and North Dakota, all offering lower costs for housing, goods, and services compared to the national average. The study highlights that in these states, a smaller percentage of household income is spent on essentials like housing. For example, in West Virginia, fewer than 20% of residents are cost-burdened by housing. These states provide a more affordable lifestyle, which is an attractive factor for both residents and businesses looking to relocate. (not investment advice)</p>
