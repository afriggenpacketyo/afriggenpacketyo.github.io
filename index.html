          <p>Oracle's shares experienced a notable increase of approximately 8% after the company released its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, surpassing Wall Street's projections for both earnings per share and revenue. The company's cloud infrastructure revenue is anticipated to increase by more than 70% in fiscal year 2026, a substantial increase from the 52% growth observed in the current quarter. Oracle also announced strategic partnerships with Cleveland Clinic and G42 for an AI platform in healthcare, along with cloud and consulting commitments with IBM, and SoftBank's acquisition of Ampere, an Oracle-backed chip design startup. This performance reflects the company's strong position in the cloud computing market and its strategic investments in artificial intelligence and partnerships. The company's financial outlook appears optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the cloud sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's declaration that the trade war with China is "done," logistics and retail industry executives express concerns about the enduring damage to the supply chain, U.S. consumers, and the overall economy. The existing tariffs, including a reported 55% tariff on Chinese goods, are expected to cause instability for consumer goods companies and potentially lead to price increases or expense cuts. Uncertainty surrounding tariffs continues to weigh on EU exports to the U.S., with freight carriers fearing a major correction due to tariff uncertainty and lingering recession fears. The trucking industry is particularly vulnerable, with carriers worried about recovering losses due to decreased demand and supply chain disruptions. The ongoing trade tensions create an environment of distrust, making it difficult for businesses to make long-term decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli forces recovered the bodies of two Israeli hostages in Gaza, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of whom was identified as Yair Yaakov, a 59-year-old killed in his home during the October 7 attack. Netanyahu expressed condolences to the families and thanked the soldiers for their efforts in the recovery mission, while the IDF stated the operation was enabled by precise intelligence. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed sorrow and reiterated the urgency of bringing all hostages home, emphasizing that the hostages have no time to spare. The recovery comes amidst ongoing efforts to secure the release of remaining hostages, with conflicting reports on progress and Hamas rejecting Netanyahu's claims of significant advancements. The situation remains tense, with families grieving and calls for a swift resolution to the hostage crisis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the Trump administration is open to extending the 90-day tariff pause for top trading partners who demonstrate "good faith" in ongoing trade negotiations. Bessent stated the U.S. is working towards deals with its 18 "important trading partners" and is likely to extend the pause for those negotiating constructively, while those not negotiating will not receive an extension. This contrasts with previous statements requiring at least "terms of an agreement" before extending the pause, suggesting a potential shift in the administration's approach. President Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced on April 9, is set to end in less than a month, with only formal trade agreements with the U.K. and a framework agreement with China announced so far. The extension of the tariff pause is contingent on the cooperation of trading partners.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from fossil fuel-fired power plants, potentially eliminating limits on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S. The EPA argues that pollution from U.S. power plants is a small part of global emissions and that eliminating climate pollution from power plants would have little effect on public health. Environmental groups criticized the proposal, arguing that it is bad for public health and the climate, while the coal industry applauded the move. The proposal would eliminate rules finalized during the Biden administration that required existing coal and new natural gas-fired power plants to significantly reduce their carbon dioxide pollution, starting in the 2030s. The administration's move is part of a broader effort to embrace fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Researchers have analyzed gold coins found near the San Jose galleon, which sank off the coast of Colombia in 1708, confirming they are from the iconic shipwreck. The coins feature depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, as well as the "Crowned Pillars of Hercules," and researchers were able to discern the letters "PVA" and the date of minting (1707) on some coins. The Colombian government announced it would begin extractions from the ship, which was discovered in 2015, and declared the site a "protected archeological area" in May 2024. Multiple parties have laid claim to the shipwreck, including Colombia, Spain, and Indigenous Qhara Qhara Bolivians, while the cause of the sinking remains debated. The shipwreck is believed to hold gold, silver, gemstones, and other treasure worth billions of dollars.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Donald Trump argued that the appeal of his felony conviction in New York should be moved to federal court, claiming the case related to official acts as president. Trump's attorney, Jeffrey Wall, argued that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office included evidence related to Trump's official acts, including testimony from former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office argued that Trump's legal team took too long to request the move, and that the evidence presented did not relate to his official acts. The three-judge panel acknowledged the case was "extraordinary" and "highly unusual," and is expected to issue a written opinion at a later date.

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom's attempt to block the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, calling it a "crass political stunt." The DOJ argued that President Trump has the authority to mobilize the National Guard to protect federal personnel and facilities during the anti-ICE protests, citing the inability of local and state law enforcement to control the unrest. The agency referenced comments from LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, who stated that "things have gotten out of control."

          <p>Images of unrest in Los Angeles, including burning vehicles and clashes between protesters and police, have sparked a debate about the true reality on the ground. While President Trump and his supporters portray L.A. as "out of control," others argue that the protests were triggered by aggressive ICE raids. Despite the unrest, a national poll indicates mixed feelings about the administration's handling of deportations and the deployment of the National Guard and Marines. The situation underscores the deep political polarization surrounding immigration and law enforcement. The accuracy of media portrayals is questioned amid the political spin.</p>

          <p>A coalition of states has filed a lawsuit against the bankrupt DNA-testing company 23andMe to prevent the sale of its customers’ genetic data without explicit consent. The lawsuit argues that customers have an inherent right to their own genetic information, which is considered uniquely sensitive and irreplaceable. The company's bankruptcy has raised concerns about privacy standards for genetic data, with 23andMe announcing in May that it would be sold to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, though a competing offer has since emerged. 23andMe maintains that the sale of genetic data does not violate privacy regulations, but customers have the right to delete their data from the company's database.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of the military against protesters in Los Angeles and disregard for federal court orders have prompted concerns about the state of democratic institutions in the United States. Governor Gavin Newsom has accused Trump of abusing executive power by deploying the National Guard without his consent, warning that his actions threaten democratic norms. Trump has also bypassed Congress by issuing numerous executive orders, more than any president in a similar timeframe since World War II. Critics argue that Trump is eroding the balance of power among the three branches of government, raising questions about the long-term implications for U.S. democracy.</p>

The DOJ, under the Trump administration, is requesting "all records" relating to 2024 federal elections from Colorado, as well as preserving any records from the 2020 election. The request has raised concerns about potential disinformation and political motivations, with some suspecting it is tied to the state's prosecution of a Trump ally, Tina Peters. The DOJ's Civil Rights Division, now led by Harmeet Dhillon, has undergone a transformation and is prioritizing searching for voter fraud.
