        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australians headed to the polls to elect a new government, with the soaring cost of living and economic uncertainty being the top concerns for voters. Opinion polls suggest that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party has a slight edge over the conservative opposition. The election comes at a time of heightened geopolitical and trade uncertainty, with Trump's policies and tariffs playing a significant role in the campaign. Albanese has promised modest tax cuts and cheaper healthcare, while Dutton has vowed to slash fuel tax and invest in infrastructure. The election results could come as soon as Saturday night, unless the vote is very tight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the executive order violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments to the Constitution, determining that it sought to punish the firm for representing clients and holding employment policies disfavored by the president. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele. The judge said the executive order was issued as retribution for Perkins Coie's work and Mr. Trump's grievances.</p>

          <p>The remains of two domestic cats, an adult and a juvenile, were discovered in the wreckage of a 500-year-old Spanish ship that sank in Florida's Pensacola Bay in 1559. Researchers believe these remains likely represent the earliest example of cats in what is now the United States. Cats were often brought on ships to hunt rats and mice, and analysis suggests the adult cat's diet consisted mainly of fish and possibly domestic meat. While it's unclear if the cats were intentionally brought on board, their presence indicates they may have served as pest control and were potentially cared for by the sailors.</p>

The event will feature thousands of soldiers, vehicles, and aircraft. Trump first proposed a military parade during his first term but scrapped the idea due to cost concerns. In addition to the parade, Trump has announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II," though it's unclear if these will become federal holidays.</p>

          <p>President Trump's involvement in crypto products has reportedly increased his family's wealth by billions, with crypto holdings now representing a significant portion of his net worth. This increase is attributed to the release of meme coins and a stake in a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family. As the president's investments in crypto have grown, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into a dozen crypto companies since his inauguration. Critics suggest potential conflicts of interest, while the White House dismisses these concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices after the tariff change and started adding import charges for U.S. customers. The company says pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model.</p>

A lack of bilateral trust is fueled by disputes over China's role in fentanyl production, which prompted Trump to impose tariffs on Chinese goods.
