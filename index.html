          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030, marking the first time a clear target has been set on the issue. This commitment follows significant public outcry and new data showing serious pollution incidents reached a record high in 2024. The plan also includes a ban on wet wipes containing plastic and aims to reduce phosphorus pollution. While critics note the pledge is not legally binding, it is part of a broader government effort to reform the water sector amid scrutiny over company performance and executive bonuses.</p>

          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall across South Korea have resulted in at least 14 fatalities and left 12 other individuals missing, according to government reports. The severe weather caused landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, primarily in southern regions which received up to 800 millimeters (31 inches) of rain. One of the deadliest incidents occurred in the southern town of Sancheong, where eight people were found dead. As of Sunday, approximately 3,840 people have been evacuated from their homes, though the rain has subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted across the country.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, age 46, returned to the ring after a four-year retirement, fighting WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw in Las Vegas. While one judge scored the bout in favor of Barrios, the other two declared it a draw, allowing Barrios to retain his title. Pacquiao, who showed flashes of his former speed, believed he had won the close contest and immediately expressed his desire for a rematch. Despite his age, he lasted the full 12 rounds, landing a significant number of power punches in a performance that was a testament to his enduring stamina.</p>

          <p>In a positive development following devastating floods in Texas, officials in Kerr County have announced that the number of people reported missing has decreased from nearly 100 to just three. This significant reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies who verified the safety of many individuals initially unaccounted for. The update brings a measure of relief to the hard-hit region, which suffered the majority of the 134 fatalities from the statewide flooding event earlier in the month. Three people also remain missing in Travis County and one in Burnet County.</p>

          <p>Actor Freddie Prinze Jr. recently reflected on his long-standing marriage to Sarah Michelle Gellar, attributing their 23-year success to mutual respect and the fact that they were friends before their relationship became romantic. He emphasized that marriage is hard work and that what works for them may not work for everyone. The couple, who met while filming "I Know What You Did Last Summer" in 1997, married in 2002 and have two children together. Gellar has previously echoed the sentiment that relationships require effort, contrasting it with what she sees as an increasingly disposable societal attitude.</p>

          <p>A California woman, Linda Duffey Gwozdz, was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, despite her unusual defense. Gwozdz claimed she accidentally shot him twice in the head while they were playing a game inspired by an Elmer Fudd cartoon, believing the gun was unloaded after he said, "No more buwwets." The initial investigation was complex, with one detective initially believing her eccentric story. However, forensic evidence, including the difficulty of rapidly fan-firing the double-action revolver used, and inconsistencies in her account ultimately led to her arrest and conviction after a second trial.</p>

          <p>In a notable case of technology influencing justice, a Wisconsin man was cleared of murder charges in the 2016 death of his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, thanks to data from his Fitbit. Doug Detrie, the initial suspect, was arrested but later released after his fitness tracker's data corroborated his story that he was home and mostly inactive during the time of the murder. Subsequently, investigators used DNA evidence and location data from the real killer's Android phone, via Google Dashboard, to track his movements. This technological evidence was crucial in identifying, arresting, and ultimately convicting George Steven Burch for the crime.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece posits that the extreme difficulty in achieving peace in conflicts from Gaza to Ukraine is rooted in more than just political failure; it reflects a global crisis of morality. The article argues that a shared, universal moral order has fractured, replaced by moral relativism where atrocities are justified by different groups based on their own perspectives. This collapse of agreed-upon ethical standards makes impartial mediation and peaceful settlements nearly impossible, leaving coercion and manipulation as the primary tools. The author suggests this modern retreat into subjective morality and away from shared responsibility is a key obstacle to resolving global suffering.</p>

          <p>England's national rugby team achieved a decisive six-try win against the US Eagles during a match in Washington D.C. that was marked by challenging, humid conditions and two separate lightning delays. Despite the lengthy interruptions, the mostly young English squad performed with greater precision than their American opponents, securing a comfortable victory. The match was part of a doubleheader event that also featured a compelling contest between the US and Fiji women's teams. World Rugby's CEO noted the event is part of a long-term investment strategy to build the sport's audience in the U.S. ahead of future World Cups.</p>

          <p>Players at the WNBA All-Star Game made a unified statement regarding their ongoing labor dispute by wearing warmup shirts that read, "Pay us what you owe us." The protest comes after the players and the league failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in recent meetings. The WNBA Players Association opted out of the previous CBA last October and is currently fighting for a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. Some players have indicated a potential walkout could occur in October if a new agreement is not reached.</p>
