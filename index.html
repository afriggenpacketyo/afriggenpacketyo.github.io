        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's largest state-owned banks are facing significant profitability challenges due to a slowing economy, reduced interest rates, and weak demand for loans. First-half earnings reports from institutions like ICBC and China Construction Bank show a decline in net interest margins, a critical indicator of profitability, falling below the threshold considered necessary for stability. While government support has helped lower the ratio of non-performing loans, the overall financial pressure on these key institutions reflects broader economic headwinds within the country. The data indicates a persistent strain on the banking sector's financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

Fletcher's father described him as a boy who loved fishing and cooking, while Harper's parents remembered her joyful spirit and kindness. Both families expressed immense grief over the senseless act of violence and called for meaningful action to address gun violence and the mental health crisis in the United States.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children starting in January of the upcoming year. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. This decision aims to protect children from severe complications and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work, estimated to cost £24 million annually. Health officials hope the move will make chickenpox a "thing of the past," aligning the UK with other countries that have offered the vaccine for years.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's legal team has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleges he illegally saved approximately $150 million by delaying the disclosure of his growing stake in Twitter (now X). The SEC claims Musk failed to report his holdings within the required 10-day period, allowing him to purchase more shares at artificially low prices.

          <p>Alibaba announced better-than-expected net income for the June quarter, largely fueled by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. The company attributed this strong performance to robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue showing triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall revenues slightly missed analyst forecasts, the firm's e-commerce business also showed signs of revival. However, profitability in the e-commerce sector was impacted by heavy investment in the competitive "instant commerce" market in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Bank of America Institute reveals that wealthier shoppers return a higher percentage of their retail purchases compared to other income groups. In 2025, high-income households refunded 5.3% of their purchases, while lower-income households returned only 3.7%. The analysis suggests that affluent consumers are more likely to engage in "bracketing," where they buy multiple versions of an item with the intention of returning most of them. This trend contributes to the high cost of returns for retailers, who have responded by tightening their return policies, such as by charging fees or shortening return windows.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Federalization of D.C. Police Could Pave Way for a National Police Force</h2>

          <p>President Trump's recent takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department is raising concerns about a broader effort to centralize law enforcement authority under federal control. This move, combined with an FBI mission shift towards violent crime and an executive order to create new federal public safety units, is seen by critics as steps toward creating a "national police force." Analysts worry that such a force could be staffed with individuals loyal to Trump personally rather than the rule of law. This centralization of power could have significant implications for future national crises or challenges to election results.</p>

          <p>Russia's Foreign Ministry has condemned Western proposals for Ukraine's security guarantees, labeling them "one-sided" and designed to contain Russia. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that the plans would turn Ukraine into a "strategic provocateur" on Russia's borders, thereby increasing the risk of a direct armed conflict between Moscow and NATO. She asserted that any legitimate security guarantees must take Russia's own security interests into account. This statement comes as Ukraine's allies work to formulate a framework to protect Kyiv from potential future Russian aggression as part of a peace settlement.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that it will not invite an official Israeli government delegation to the upcoming Defense Security and Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition in London. A government spokesperson cited Israel's decision to escalate its military operation in Gaza as the reason, calling the action "wrong." This move reflects growing criticism from UK leaders regarding Israel's conduct in the war. Israel's defense ministry responded by calling the decision a "deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination" and confirmed it would withdraw its national pavilion from the event, though private Israeli defense firms can still attend.</p>

          <p>The families of two of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022 are asking a judge to prevent the public release of graphic crime scene photos and videos from the investigation. Ethan Chapin's mother, Stacy Chapin, stated in a court document that the images are "heartbreaking" and their release would be traumatizing and violate their privacy. Although the city of Moscow released some images with bodies blurred after the killer's sentencing, the families' lawyer argued the redaction was ineffective and failed to hide blood stains or mute the sounds of distress. The case highlights the conflict between public records laws and the privacy rights of victims' families.</p>

The USTR stated the decision was made after considering public comments and advice from interagency committees.

          <p>The White House has selected Jim O’Neill, a deputy to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to serve as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The appointment follows the controversial firing of the previous director, Susan Monarez, and has prompted the resignation of four other senior CDC leaders who cited political interference. O'Neill, who does not have a medical or scientific background, previously worked as an investment executive and for conservative tech investor Peter Thiel. His selection is seen as aligning the agency with Kennedy's goal of overhauling U.S. vaccine policy.</p>

          <p>An opinion column in the Los Angeles Times argues that the current college affordability crisis stems from a shift in government policy away from viewing higher education as a public good. The article traces a long history of government investment in college, from Thomas Jefferson's proposals to the G.I. Bill, arguing that such subsidies were seen as essential for democracy and national security. The author contends that the skyrocketing cost of tuition began in the 1980s when state funding was cut, shifting the financial burden onto students. The column concludes that restoring affordability requires renewed government investment, not further reductions in support.</p>

          <p>A contributor column argues that for Democrats to effectively challenge the Trump administration, they must focus on kitchen-table economic issues rather than abstract threats to democracy. The author points to the 2024 election, where inflation and the cost of eggs were more potent issues for voters than constitutional norms. With grocery prices rising again under President Trump, the article suggests Democrats have a clear opening to connect his policies, like tariffs and immigration crackdowns, to the financial strain on everyday Americans. The piece concludes that saving democracy requires proving it is more economically beneficial for voters than the alternative.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to take a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel is facing backlash from conservative and libertarian economic experts, who warn it undermines free-market principles. Critics argue that such government intervention could lead to cronyism, with corporate decisions being influenced by political priorities rather than economic efficiency. The move, funded by the CHIPS and Science Act, is seen as a departure from past U.S. policy, where government ownership stakes were typically reserved for crisis situations like the 2008 financial collapse. A White House official suggested similar transactions could occur in other industries, fueling further concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece examines President Trump's recent promise to seek the death penalty for all murders committed in Washington, D.C. The author argues this pledge is unconstitutional, as the Supreme Court has long ruled against mandatory death sentences, requiring individualized consideration for each case. Furthermore, restoring capital punishment in the district, which has a large Black population, would reintroduce a practice with a deeply racist history in the U.S. The article suggests the move is a form of racial politics, reinforcing a message of white dominance in the city following the federalization of its police force.</p>
