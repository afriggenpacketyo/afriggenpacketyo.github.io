          <h2>Trump Modifies Auto Tariffs to Ease Burden on Automakers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order easing some auto tariffs to alleviate the burden on automakers facing regulatory uncertainty and additional costs. While tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies on steel and aluminum. Automakers assembling vehicles in the U.S. will be eligible for partial reimbursements on parts-related levies for two years, offering some financial relief during the transition. The article highlights the administration's intent to support the domestic auto industry amid trade policy changes.</p>

The changes modify tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components. The decision to reduce the scope of the tariffs is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s decision to impose stiff levies on nearly all trading partners has created challenges and economic uncertainty for American companies.</p>

          <p>A study found that human wounds take more than twice as long to heal as wounds of other mammals. This slower healing may be a result of an evolutionary trade-off when humans shed fur for naked, sweaty skin. Hair follicles contain stem cells that aid in skin repair, and humans have fewer follicles than furry animals. The study suggests that the benefits of sweating for cooling outweighed the costs of slower wound healing, potentially aided by social support among prehistoric humans.</p>
