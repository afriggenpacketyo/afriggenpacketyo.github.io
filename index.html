          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant, seeking to reduce dependencies on the United States for defense and technology, China for raw materials and cleantech goods, and Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized the need for Europe to shape the emerging international order to avoid simply accepting its consequences. French President Emmanuel Macron is a major proponent of this strategic autonomy, pushing for Europe to assert itself as a more independent force in global affairs. The EU seeks to strike a balance between engaging with global powers while safeguarding its own interests and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A man in England discovered that he was accidentally switched at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago, after his family had jokingly noted that he looked nothing like his parents. During the pandemic, he used a genealogy company to analyze his DNA, which revealed unfamiliar relatives and prompted him to investigate further. The discovery sheds light on a time before modern identification methods like wristbands were standard practice in hospitals, leading to rare but impactful errors. The article highlights the increasing number of such cases coming to light due to the rise in genetic testing and ancestry websites.</p>

          <p>Federal agents conducted multiple immigration enforcement operations across Los Angeles, resulting in arrests and widespread protests. The raids, involving Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI, targeted locations in the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., leading to the detention of dozens of individuals. Protests erupted in response, with demonstrators criticizing ICE and demanding justice for those detained, with one protester being the president of Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West, David Huerta, who was arrested for allegedly obstructing federal agents.

The war-torn country's infrastructure and healthcare systems are struggling to cope with the surge in cases, creating a dire situation for the affected population. The lack of clean water and sanitation, compounded by the ongoing conflict, contributes to the rapid spread of the disease.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to begin paying athletes, marking a major shift in college sports. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, will allow schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provide $2.7 billion to former players who were previously barred from revenue. The agreement is expected to lead to increased professionalization of college athletics, with potential impacts on recruitment, program offerings, and the role of the NCAA. The settlement does not resolve the threat of further litigation, as states still have separate laws regarding NIL deals.</p>

          <p>The recent phone call between the leaders of China and the US could offer a respite for many Asian countries caught in their rivalry, but the detente might also complicate their calculations on how to strike a balance between the two superpowers, according to analysts. The call between the two leaders has eased their predicament of having to choose between prioritizing trade with China and navigating aggressive US policies. Lee Seong-hyon, a senior fellow with the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, said the phone call marked a “tentative step back from the brink, offering brief respite for Asian neighbors like South Korea”. However, the relationship between the two powers had “become more fragile than ever”, noting that it was the first phone call with Xi since Trump’s inauguration in January.</p>

          <p>Facing public concern over rising rice prices, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is considering an overhaul of Japan's rice policy. The government seeks to boost rice production, but challenges remain, including the risk of a price plunge due to oversupply. Ishiba is pursuing a consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice under direct contracts with retailers to lower prices. The move comes as opposition parties urge the government to cut the consumption tax to prop up household spending, but Ishiba has opposed the tax change, expressing concern that it could hamper the government's efforts to secure sufficient funding for social security.</p>
