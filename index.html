          <p>An investigation into lead poisoning at a kindergarten in China's Gansu province has been escalated to the central government level. The State Council, China's cabinet, has joined provincial leaders to form a task force after local tests failed to identify the issue, which was only discovered when children were tested in another province. Authorities suspect the kindergarten used inedible paint to color food, leading to the detention of eight individuals, including the principal. The expanded investigation involves experts from national health and environmental ministries to address the serious public health concern.</p>

          <p>During a Lakers NBA Summer League game, Bronny James showcased a solid performance under the watchful eye and direct instruction of his father, LeBron James. The younger James scored 14 points and demonstrated strong defensive skills, contributing to the Lakers' 94-81 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. Throughout the game, LeBron was seen actively coaching his son from his baseline seat, offering advice that Bronny appeared to immediately implement on the court. Lakers assistant coach Lindsey Harding praised Bronny's decision-making and emphasized the importance of live game experience for his development.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia Faces Growing Influence of Religious Conservatism in Politics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:38:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant political shift marked by the rise of Islamic-oriented parties, challenging the current government of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The opposition coalition, Perikatan Nasional (PN), which includes the conservative Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial electoral ground, particularly among younger Malay voters. This "green wave" reflects a growing desire for policies aligned with conservative Islamic ideology, such as stricter dress codes and the implementation of Islamic criminal law in states governed by PAS. Analysts suggest this trend is fueled by disillusionment with establishment parties and poses a long-term challenge to Malaysia's multi-ethnic, liberal democratic framework.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales recording their warmest days of 2025 so far. Temperatures peaked at 33.1°C in Herefordshire, England, prompting the UK Health Security Agency to issue amber heat health alerts for southern and eastern England, warning of risks to the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heatwave has led to hosepipe bans and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. The Met Office forecasts a break in the heat starting Monday, with cooler temperatures and heavy rain expected for many parts of the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that China's massive dam projects on the Tibetan plateau, contrary to fears in India, may actually alleviate water scarcity during dry seasons. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that downstream water flows to India increased significantly, with a rise of over 50 percent in February. This suggests that the dams regulate water release, boosting supply during drier periods rather than causing droughts as previously feared. The findings provide a new perspective on the potential downstream impacts of China's controversial dam-building activities in the region.</p>

The announcement was met with criticism, with the EU threatening "proportionate countermeasures" and Mexico calling the proposal an "unfair deal" while insisting its sovereignty is non-negotiable. The administration warned that any retaliatory tariffs would be met with further increases from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room was the result of a volatile three-person relationship, or "throuple," involving herself, Zachary Abell, and Christina Araujo. Investigators pieced together a story of jealousy, alcohol-fueled violence, and control, culminating in a brutal beating in Room 15 of the Sportsman's Lodge. Araujo took a plea deal and testified against Abell, claiming he led the fatal assault. Abell's defense argued Araujo was the sole murderer, driven by jealousy. Ultimately, a jury convicted Abell of second-degree murder, the same charge as Araujo, sentencing him to life in prison for his role in the crime.</p>

          <p>Despite recent speculation about resuming production, Boeing's iconic C-17 Globemaster III cargo jet was originally discontinued in 2015 primarily due to a lack of demand. The U.S. Air Force, its main customer, had completed its purchase order, and international sales were insufficient to keep the Long Beach, California production line open. Furthermore, defense budget cuts under the 2011 Budget Control Act made the expensive aircraft a less viable option for continued procurement. The C-17 was renowned for its massive cargo capacity and ability to land on short, undeveloped runways, making it a versatile asset for both military and humanitarian missions.</p>

          <h2>Startups Develop Lab-Grown Cheese, Facing Challenges of Consumer Acceptance and Market Trends</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several companies, including London-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk. This technology aims to produce cheese that tastes like the real thing without involving animals, but it faces significant hurdles. The market for plant-based cheese has recently declined, and consumer concerns about price and ultra-processed foods present challenges. Proponents argue that lab-grown versions can be healthier and more sustainable, and they hope to overcome taste and texture issues that have plagued earlier vegan cheese alternatives, eventually launching their products in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, England, successfully located her long-lost older brother in Australia after learning of his existence only after their mother's death. Jess Basey-Fisher was told by her father that her mother had given a baby boy up for adoption in 1962 before they had met. Using the few details she had, Jess tracked down her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, and the two connected via FaceTime, discovering remarkable similarities. Shortly after they first spoke, Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to support him and make memories with the family she never knew she had.</p>

          <p>A former lumberjack and a teenager who were initially arrested in connection with the felling of the famous Sycamore Gap tree have spoken out about the intense public scrutiny and online abuse they faced. Walter Renwick, who had recently been evicted from a nearby farm, found himself the subject of national speculation and trolling, forcing him to wear a disguise in public. Similarly, a 16-year-old boy, whose name and photo were shared online, became a target of abuse. Both were later cleared of any involvement, as two other men were eventually convicted for the act of criminal damage that destroyed the iconic landmark.</p>

          <p>Britain's remaining steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are grappling with a precarious future as the industry faces decline, plant closures, and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. The closure of blast furnaces at the Port Talbot steelworks has resulted in thousands of job losses, impacting the local economy and identity. While a 25% U.S. tariff on UK steel remains, ongoing negotiations for its removal are complicated by concerns that UK steel is no longer made from scratch. This uncertainty adds to the challenges of high energy prices and a shift away from manufacturing, leaving communities to debate whether to revive their industrial past or pivot to new industries.

In a social media post, Patel stated the "conspiracy theories just aren't true" and affirmed his commitment to serving the president. The denial comes amid reports of a "heated confrontation" between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the public handling of the Epstein matter.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to a massive coltan mine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, currently under the control of the M23 rebel group. The Rubaya mining site, vital for the global production of mobile phones, employs thousands of miners who work in difficult conditions for low pay. An M23-appointed supervisor claimed the group has brought security and order to the mining operations, which a UN report says generates hundreds of thousands of dollars for the rebels through taxation. This access comes as a fragile ceasefire is in place, with the US reportedly seeking mineral rights in the region as part of a broader peace process.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival in viewership, with its social media growth, particularly on TikTok, significantly outpacing its television audience. While TV ratings are returning to 2022 levels, the show's official accounts have gained over a million new followers on TikTok alone in 2025. Content creators and fans note that short-form clips, recaps, and online discourse make the show more accessible to busy viewers who may not commit to watching the hour-long nightly episodes. This shift in consumption habits is changing how audiences engage with the contestants, relying on condensed clips rather than the full narrative of the show.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country have killed at least 129 people, including children at a summer camp, with dozens still missing. The disaster was caused by a massive weather system that dumped extreme rainfall on the flood-prone region, causing the river to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts before the "pitch black wall of death" struck. The event has prompted a massive search and recovery effort and a debate over funding for more robust flood warning systems.</p>

          <p>Investigators have begun a multi-year excavation at the site of the former St. Mary's mother and baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of hundreds of children. The home, run by the Bon Secours Sisters from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. Local historian Catherine Corliss uncovered death records for 796 babies and young children who died at the home but could find no corresponding burial records, leading to the discovery of human remains in a defunct sewage tank in 2017. Survivors and relatives hope the excavation will identify the children and provide answers and dignity to the deceased.</p>
