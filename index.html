            <p>Cody Allen Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted homicide, arson, and terrorism after allegedly firebombing Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's home while the governor and his family were inside. Court records reveal Balmer had been struggling with financial and domestic issues, including foreclosure proceedings and allegations of domestic assault. Balmer reportedly told police he harbored hatred toward Shapiro and would have attacked him if confronted. He is currently being held without bail, and investigators are reviewing his social media activity for further insights into his motives.</p>

            <p>Owen Ray, an American college student, spoke out after being detained in Denmark for nearly two weeks following an alleged dispute with an Uber driver. Ray maintains his innocence, stating that he and his friend were wrongly arrested after the driver allegedly became aggressive over a fare dispute. He and his friend were initially held for 10 days, with the detention later extended until April 24, but have since been released pending further investigation. The U.S. State Department is providing consular assistance, and Ray hopes the case will be dropped so he can return home.</p>

            <p>Shares of LVMH experienced a sharp decline after reporting a drop in first-quarter sales, leading to Hermes surpassing it as the world's most valuable luxury firm. The sales decline was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China, particularly for wines and spirits. Analysts suggest that uncertainty surrounding trade tensions and tariffs is impacting the luxury sector, which is reliant on global supply chains. LVMH CFO Cecile Cabanis noted that the group is considering repricing goods to offset inflation and currency swings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's return to power is bolstering China's long-held view of a declining United States and a shifting global order. Chinese experts believe Trump's policies are accelerating a "once-in-a-century transformation," where American influence wanes and new powers rise. This perspective aligns with President Xi Jinping's call for China and Russia to "drive the changes together," signaling a strategic alignment against Washington.</p>

            <p>This article examines the Trump administration's tariff policy, noting its shift towards targeting China while seeking trade deals with other nations. Trump's advisors hope to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, address national security concerns, boost exports, and potentially restructure the global currency system. However, the article cautions that tariffs could lead to economic damage by increasing costs, chilling investment, and creating uncertainty. Critics also point out that the policy is not well-tailored to achieve its aims and is harming allies.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off in response to President Trump's tariff policies, causing yields to rise. This prompted questions about who was selling the safe-haven asset. Potential sellers include China, Japan's life insurers, and hedge funds. China's potential weaponization of Treasury holdings and Japan's insurers reducing exposure to U.S. debt are cited as possible factors. The sell-off is unusual because investors typically flock to U.S. debt during times of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A top Chinese cyberspace official warned that U.S. efforts to curb China's artificial intelligence (AI) advancements are likely to harm the U.S. itself. Sun Weimin, chief engineer at the Cyberspace Administration of China, called for increased regional collaboration in AI. She criticized the U.S.'s use of tariffs, arguing that they disrupt global value chains and hamper innovation. China and the United States have been engaged in a trade war following sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>

            <h2>Defining Classical Music by Its Creative Process</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-15 07:00:00 EDT</div>

            <p>This article explores the definition of classical music, arguing that it is best understood not by its sound, but by its creative process: written music. The author contends that the defining characteristic of classical music is that it comes into being through the act of composition, with the score serving as the authoritative reference point. This perspective broadens the definition of classical music to include works by artists not traditionally associated with the genre, such as Duke Ellington.</p>

            <p>Meta's new content-moderation regime, focusing on "illegal and high-severity violations," places the onus on users to report problematic content. This means content creators like the Maccabeats, a Jewish a cappella group, must individually report every instance of harassment they receive or live with their social media being turned against them. The article proposes that Meta should provide users with tools to ban not just the author of a bigoted remark but also every one of the thousands of people who liked the offending post.</p>

            <h2>Unexpected Consequence of Trump's Tariffs: Impact on Russian Oil</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>While Russia was initially excluded from President Trump's new tariffs, the policy has inadvertently disrupted the Russian economy by causing a drop in oil prices. Falling oil prices negatively impact Russia, which relies on oil and gas sales for a significant portion of its government revenues. This development could weaken Russia's ability to sustain its war in Ukraine. The irony is that this outcome occurred despite the tariffs being seemingly designed not to hurt Russia.</p>
