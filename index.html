          <p>President Trump's budget package has cleared a hurdle in the House after conservative Republicans initially stalled the bill due to concerns over insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications and the bill's advancement, though conservatives still seek stricter Medicaid work requirements and the end of clean energy subsidies. The legislation, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term, faces further challenges in the Rules Committee and potential opposition in the Senate. The bill's next stop is the Rules Committee, which can make updates to the package.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to visit the White House to counter what he views as misinformation from President Trump, particularly regarding claims of a genocide against white farmers in South Africa. Ramaphosa aims to persuade Trump that close ties with South Africa, the largest economy in Africa, benefit the United States. He also intends to engage with Elon Musk, a vocal critic of South Africa, to explore potential business opportunities for Tesla and SpaceX in the country, such as building electric vehicle charging stations and utilizing South African facilities for rocket launches. Ramaphosa also plans to address America's support of Israel by arguing that the term genocide is inappropriately used in the South Africa context.</p>

Military analysts suggest this area could become a hotspot, particularly within the Arctic Circle, and recent military exercises involving American and Finnish troops have focused on Arctic warfare scenarios.

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing expectations, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the country's economy. Industrial output grew by 6.1%, surpassing forecasts, despite the impact of U.S. tariffs. The urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1%, and fixed-asset investment rose by 4.0%. Trade-war fears have receded after a meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives, leading to a temporary rollback of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump’s "one big, beautiful bill" has passed a key hurdle in the House of Representatives, advancing it closer to a vote. The bill cleared the House Budget Committee after four conservative Republicans initially blocked it, seeking assurances of stricter Medicaid and green energy subsidy crackdowns. The bill includes tax cuts, immigration measures, energy policies, and defense spending. The bill's next stop is the House Rules Committee.</p>

          <p>Prostate cancer experts say that former President Joseph R. Biden’s recent diagnosis is serious, as the cancer has spread to his bones and is classified as Stage 4. However, advancements in treatment and diagnosis have significantly improved survival rates, allowing patients to live for years rather than months. The initial approach involves cutting off testosterone, which fuels prostate cancer, and doctors now have more precise scans and a range of new treatments. Experts credit federal research funding, including Biden’s cancer moonshot effort, for this progress.</p>
