The airline stated there was a "reaction near the engine" caused by a disturbance in airflow, which prompted the crew to perform a controlled shutdown of the engine. No injuries were reported among the 273 passengers and eight crew members aboard the aircraft.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, currently a Category 2 storm, is projected to move parallel to the U.S. East Coast, bringing dangerous rip currents and high waves without making direct landfall. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, where coastal flooding has prompted evacuation orders. While the storm's center is expected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S., its large size means its effects will be felt widely. Officials are urging the public to heed warnings and avoid entering the ocean, as conditions are expected to remain hazardous for much of the week.</p>

In an unusual turn, victims' families in some cases have gained roles on creditor committees, influencing bankruptcy proceedings to secure larger settlements and a say in the reorganized companies' future operations.</p>

          <p>Actress Alicia Silverstone recently revealed that she took a break from her acting career after her rise to fame in the 1990s because it "didn't feel as fun" anymore. During the height of her popularity following films like "Clueless," Silverstone found the intense scrutiny and judgment of her appearance to be overwhelming. She shifted her focus toward activism, writing books on health and wellness, and being a present mother to her son. Silverstone has since returned to acting with a renewed passion, balancing her career with her other commitments, and is set to star in a new series and reprise her iconic role as Cher Horowitz.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts-based company Excel Dryer successfully shifted its supply chain to be entirely sourced from American-made parts, a long-term goal that was reinforced by the implementation of tariffs on Chinese goods. The family-run business, which manufactures electric hand dryers, spent eight years searching for a domestic motor supplier to complete its transition away from reliance on Chinese components. This strategic decision not only allowed the company to avoid the financial impact of the tariffs but also fulfilled the owner's vision of supporting domestic manufacturing. The move showcases a proactive business strategy in response to global trade volatility and geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that while many investors remain confident about their portfolio performance despite market volatility, there is a notable split between newer and more seasoned participants. Newer investors are reportedly more bullish, while experienced investors are adopting a more cautious approach and showing lower risk tolerance. Financial experts advise that all investors should consistently "calibrate" the level of risk they are willing to take based on their long-term goals and changing life circumstances. Maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, potentially utilizing tools like exchange-traded funds, is recommended to navigate market ups and downs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Across many parts of Asia, women seeking to end their marriages confront deep-seated cultural stigma, financial insecurity, and challenging legal systems. In countries like Pakistan, women who initiate divorce may face social shaming and retaliatory legal actions from their husbands, while in the Philippines, divorce remains illegal, forcing couples into a lengthy and costly annulment process. Societal pressures often prioritize family honor over individual well-being, branding women who leave their marriages as selfish. Experts argue that even where legal avenues for divorce exist, financial dependence and collectivist cultural norms make it incredibly difficult for women to make independent choices.</p>

This practice allows large corporations to absorb key AI researchers and technology while potentially skirting the intense regulatory scrutiny associated with traditional mergers and acquisitions.

          <h2>Spike Lee's New Film 'Highest 2 Lowest' Receives Critical Review</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1960s thriller "High and Low," starring Denzel Washington as a successful music producer facing a moral dilemma. The movie's plot centers on a kidnapping where the chauffeur's son is taken by mistake instead of the executive's own child. The review notes that while the film starts with a somewhat chaotic and choppy style, it finds its footing with a compelling ransom-exchange sequence and strong performances. The article suggests the film serves as a self-aware satire, exploring themes of creative integrity, class disparity, and what happens when a cultural tastemaker risks losing his edge.</p>

          <p>Matcha, the finely ground green tea powder, is experiencing a major resurgence in popularity, nearly a decade after its first wave as a niche health trend. This new boom is largely fueled by social media platforms like TikTok, where the drink's vibrant green color and the ritual of its preparation are highly photogenic. Unlike the previous trend, this wave is characterized by extreme customization, with consumers often adding significant amounts of milk, sugar, and flavored syrups to create sweet lattes, diluting the tea's natural taste. The trend reflects a broader consumer desire for aesthetic, experiential products that can be shared online.</p>

          <p>The FBI has arrested Sean Gardner, a former coach at an elite Iowa gymnastics academy, on a federal child pornography charge, years after he was first accused of sexual abuse. Reports made to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022 alleged that Gardner sexually abused at least three young gymnasts at Chow's Gymnastics and secretly recorded others at a previous job. Despite being suspended from coaching by SafeSport, his disciplinary case remains unresolved, and the criminal investigation was slow to progress. The case highlights concerns about the slow and often opaque process for investigating abuse allegations within the Olympic sports system.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media Group, already the largest owner of television stations in the U.S., has announced an agreement to acquire Tegna Inc. and its 64 broadcast outlets in a deal valued at $6.2 billion. The acquisition will significantly expand Nexstar's reach, and the deal is expected to be a major test of TV station ownership rules under the current Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Broadcasters have been advocating for the FCC to lift the current ownership cap, which limits a single company's coverage to 39% of the country, arguing that consolidation is necessary to compete with large tech and media companies.</p>

          <p>Police in Harris County, Texas, are actively searching for Tory Dugas, a 36-year-old man who was mistakenly released from jail just as he was supposed to begin a seven-year prison sentence. Dugas had been sentenced for assaulting a family member and evading arrest. According to the sheriff's office, it appears jail staff failed to properly document his new sentence in his file, leading to the erroneous release when other charges against him were dismissed.

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to end mail-in voting, stating that an executive order is being drafted to ban the practice before the 2026 midterm elections. The president has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that mail-in ballots are corrupt and susceptible to widespread fraud. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections, meaning any such executive order would face immediate and significant legal challenges. Election experts maintain that mail-in voting is a secure method that has been used since the Civil War and that widespread fraud is a myth.</p>

The plan reportedly involves a 60-day truce during which about half of the remaining hostages would be released while negotiations for a permanent ceasefire continue. Israel's government has recently stated it would only accept a comprehensive deal for the release of all hostages, and its official position on the new proposal remains unchanged.

          <p>Despite being used by at least 60% of Americans, the dietary supplement industry operates under very loose federal regulation, creating what some critics call a "Wild West" environment for consumers. Under a decades-old law, supplement makers can make vague health claims without undergoing rigorous clinical trials to prove safety or efficacy, unlike pharmaceutical drugs. The FDA has limited power to intervene unless a product is proven to cause severe harm after it's already on the market. Health experts advise consumers to be cautious, as many supplements lack convincing scientific backing and taking high doses of certain vitamins can even be harmful.</p>

She argues that the Democratic party's losses are often due to abandoning populist economic policies that resonate with voters, rather than being too progressive.

          <p>The Trump administration has effectively dismantled the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, a major student loan relief program from the Biden era, by resuming interest charges for borrowers. This change forces many of the plan's 8 million enrollees to switch to other repayment plans to avoid accruing more debt, often resulting in significantly higher monthly payments. Borrowers who shared their stories expressed dismay and anxiety, stating the increased financial burden is stalling their ability to save, plan for families, or get ahead financially.
