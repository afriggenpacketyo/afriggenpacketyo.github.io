          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe disputed reports suggesting limited damage to Iran's nuclear program following recent strikes, stating that the program has been "severely damaged." Ratcliffe cited credible intelligence, including new information from a historically reliable source, indicating the destruction of key Iranian nuclear facilities that would require years to rebuild. This statement followed President Trump's claim that U.S. strikes "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, and both officials accused the media of distorting classified intelligence to undermine Trump's leadership. The administration is actively working to counter reporting that contradicts the president's assessment of the military's achievements. The stability of the region is in question. Optimism surrounding the situation is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The body of Juliana Marins, a 26-year-old Brazilian tourist, was retrieved from a ravine at Mount Rinjani in Indonesia after she went missing on Saturday. Rescue efforts were hampered by challenging weather and terrain, taking at least five hours to bring her back to her family. Millions in Brazil followed the rescue efforts, and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed sadness upon receiving news of her death. Marins' last Instagram posts showed her backpacking around Thailand and Vietnam before reaching Indonesia, a tourist destination known for its beaches and hiking trails. The loss of life is tragic.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in a terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has been indicted on 12 federal hate crime charges. He is accused of attacking participants in a "Run For Their Lives" event, which aimed to raise awareness for Israeli hostages held by Hamas, using Molotov cocktails and shouting "Free Palestine!" The attack injured 15 people and one dog, and a handwritten document found in Soliman's car expressed anti-Semitic sentiments. Soliman reportedly told law enforcement he wanted to take revenge and targeted the event due to the flags and signs displayed by the participants. The investigation is ongoing, and Soliman's next court appearance is scheduled for Friday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes Iran's recent wartime failures against Israel, attributing them to the Iranian regime's adherence to ideology over competence and its embrace of conspiracy theories. It argues that Iran's leaders were unable to grasp Israel's actual capabilities due to their own propaganda and fantasies, leading to a swift collapse of their defenses. The article draws parallels to the United States, pointing to instances where allegiance and conspiracism have taken precedence over proficiency in government appointments. It warns that when loyalty to a ruling ideology replaces capability, and conspiracies shape decision-making, it can lead to national crises, as exemplified by Iran's situation. The future is uncertain.</p>

In response, the West Indies were reduced to 57-4 at the close of play, with Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Cummins taking wickets. This is Australia's first Test match in the Caribbean in 10 years, with a new-look top order due to injuries and team selection. The game is tense.</p>

          <p>A Quinnipiac University poll reveals a partisan divide among Americans regarding the U.S. joining Israel in military strikes against Iran's nuclear sites. Forty-two percent of voters support the strikes, while 51% oppose them, with Republicans largely in favor and Democrats largely against. Half of voters believe the strikes would make Americans less safe, while nearly 8 in 10 are concerned about the U.S. getting dragged into a war with Iran. The poll also indicates that the percentage of voters viewing the U.S. as too supportive of Israel is at an all-time high, while those viewing it as not supportive enough is at an all-time low. The stability of the Middle East is in question.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was deported and then returned to the U.S. for prosecution, will remain in jail as lawyers debate whether the Justice Department can prevent his deportation if released pending trial. A judge ordered Abrego Garcia's lawyers to file arguments, with the government responding by Friday, after denying a Justice Department request to keep him detained. The Justice Department has appealed the release order, but a federal judge declined to pause that decision, setting a hearing for July 16. Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling, and his lawyers argue that the potential deportation is a self-inflicted injury by the Department of Homeland Security. The case has garnered attention due to an "administrative error" that led to his initial deportation despite having legal status.</p>

          <p>Gunmen killed 11 people and injured at least 20 during a religious festival in Irapuato, Guanajuato, Mexico, a city plagued by cartel-related violence. The shooting occurred during celebrations marking the Nativity of John the Baptist, leaving bloodstains and bullet holes at the scene. Security forces are searching for the perpetrators, while officials provide support to those affected. Guanajuato is Mexico's deadliest state due to gang turf wars between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation cartel. Criminal violence has claimed around 480,000 lives in Mexico since 2006, with Guanajuato recording over 3,000 murders last year. The situation is dire.</p>

          <p>Thailand is implementing new regulations to control its marijuana market, restricting consumption to those with a doctor's prescription due to concerns about the industry being out of control. This comes after the decriminalization of cannabis in 2022 led to a surge in investment and the proliferation of cannabis dispensaries. Pressure from the UK, which has seen a rise in Thai marijuana smuggling, prompted the change. The new regulations aim to curb smuggling and restore the industry to its intended focus on medical use, although smaller growers fear it will wipe out their businesses. The economic future of cannabis growers is at stake.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that using copyrighted books to train AI models is fair use, marking a victory for Anthropic, which trained its AI assistant Claude using copyrighted books. The judge stated that this use was "exceedingly transformative," but the company may have broken the law by using pirated books. A trial will be held to determine damages for using pirated books, which can reach up to $150,000 per case of willful copyright infringement. The judge also ruled that making digital copies of print books for AI training falls under fair use. The future of copyright law is uncertain.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced volatility due to reports of a potential acquisition by Shell, which were later denied by Shell. BP shares initially jumped more than 10% on the report, but retreated after Shell denied the talks, closing up 1.64%. It is unlikely Shell would purchase the entirety of BP, as it is more likely that BP would be split and sold in pieces to multiple companies if a deal did transpire. BP has underperformed Shell and U.S. rivals, fueling speculation that the British oil major is an acquisition target. The market is uncertain.</p>
