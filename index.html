The search and rescue mission has now transitioned into a recovery effort for the remains of the workers inside at the time of the blast. The sheriff described the scene as one of utter devastation, with the building completely gone and debris scattered over a wide area. The plant manufactures explosives for military and aerospace clients, and the cause of the explosion is currently under federal investigation.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered in central London, marching to Whitehall a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was implemented. The event, organized by the Palestine Coalition, featured speakers who called the ceasefire a positive but precarious development, vowing to continue protesting. A small group of counter-protesters also assembled nearby, leading to a minor scuffle that resulted in a few arrests by the Metropolitan Police. The march occurred amid UK government discussions about potential new curbs on protest laws.</p>

          <p>This article details why U.S. government shutdowns occur, citing the failure of Congress and the president to agree on a budget, which is rooted in the Antideficiency Act of 1884. It explains the immediate consequences, such as the furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees and the closure of non-essential services like national parks. The current deadlock is attributed to a partisan dispute over funding for healthcare policies, including the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has showcased a new and powerful intercontinental ballistic missile, named the Hwasong-20, during a massive military parade in Pyongyang. The event, attended by leader Kim Jong Un alongside high-level delegations from China and Russia, marked the 80th anniversary of the ruling party. The parade also featured North Korean soldiers who were sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine, signaling Kim's strengthening alignment with Moscow and Beijing and his continued focus on advancing his country's strategic weapons program.</p>

          <h2>Proposed U.S. Ban on Russian Airspace Use Could Increase Costs for Chinese Airlines</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has proposed a rule that would bar Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace for flights to and from the United States. This move is intended to eliminate an unfair advantage, as U.S. carriers already avoid this airspace, resulting in longer and more expensive flights. Aviation analysts predict that if the ban is enforced, Chinese airlines may face significant losses, potentially forcing them to either absorb higher operational costs by re-routing or cancel flights altogether.

          <p>The Russian government is intensifying its digital control by mandating that a new "super app" called Max be pre-installed on every new phone sold in the country. Developed by the Russian tech giant VK, the app integrates messaging, file sharing, and banking services, aiming to replace foreign platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. This initiative is seen as a major step toward creating a "sovereign" Russian internet and providing the Kremlin with a powerful, centralized tool for monitoring its citizens' activities.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man charged with the assassination of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, have filed a motion to dismiss the federal charges against him. The defense argues that the charge carrying a potential death penalty is invalid and that evidence, including his statements and a gun found in his backpack, was obtained illegally. They claim Mangione was questioned without being read his Miranda rights and that his bag was searched without a warrant following his arrest in Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes President Donald Trump's frequent appearances at combat sports events, particularly UFC fights, as a deliberate political strategy. The author contends that Trump uses this association to cultivate an image of a tough, brawling "Ultimate Fighter" who will stop at nothing to win. This alignment, the article argues, is aimed at appealing to a specific voter demographic and serves to normalize a more brutish, rule-breaking style in the political arena, weakening collective boundaries.</p>
