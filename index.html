          <h2>UK Government Considers Expanding Ban on Destructive Bottom Trawling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 05:22:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend the prohibition of bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, in English waters. The proposal aims to increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. This move follows warnings from environmental advocates like Sir David Attenborough, who highlighted the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where pressure is mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty, which seeks to protect 30% of international waters. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, seeking input from the marine and fishing sectors.</p>

          <p>Two individuals were killed in a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip late Sunday night, according to police reports.

          <p>Health experts discuss the importance of magnesium, a mineral involved in over 300 bodily enzyme systems, including energy production, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium deficiency, common in the U.S., can lead to health issues like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of deficiency include insomnia, muscle cramps, and fatigue, and while blood tests can help detect low levels, they aren't foolproof. While magnesium is best obtained through dietary sources like nuts, seeds, and leafy greens, supplements may be recommended in certain cases, such as alcoholism or when taking certain medications, but it is important to consult with a physician before starting any supplementation.</p>

Once a hub for coal mining, the area has seen its economic base erode, leaving many feeling abandoned by modern Democrats. Despite Mr. Trump's promises to revive the coal industry and bring new jobs, many locals feel these pledges have not materialized.

While he differs with Trump on some issues, such as abortion rights and immigration, he feels looked down upon for his success as a white male entrepreneur. He acknowledges past controversial remarks, including using a racial slur, but claims his language has evolved, and that he could potentially vote for a Democrat in the future, provided he isn't "demonized" for his views.</p>

The situation underscores the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement and the role of federal intervention in local affairs, with local authorities pushing back on Trump's heavy-handed approach.</p>

While the tariffs could potentially reduce the federal debt over the next decade, they are also expected to lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. Businesses, particularly importers, face cash-flow challenges due to the upfront payment of tariffs, creating uncertainty and potentially leading to job losses in the manufacturing sector.

He has declared multiple national emergencies, including those related to border security, energy, and trade deficits, to enact policies without congressional approval. While the White House defends these actions as necessary to address pressing issues, critics argue that many of these declarations do not constitute genuine emergencies and should be handled through traditional legislative processes. Legal experts are divided on how the Supreme Court might rule on challenges to these emergency declarations, with some fearing that a favorable ruling for the administration could grant the president unchecked power.</p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), initially designed for diabetes management, are now marketed to non-diabetics, raising questions about their actual health benefits. These devices track blood sugar levels continuously, providing data on how different foods impact glucose levels, however studies have yielded mixed results regarding their effectiveness in weight loss or blood sugar control for the general population. Some individuals may benefit from CGMs if they are highly sensitive to carbohydrates or need extra motivation to eat healthier, while others may find the data confusing or misleading. Experts emphasize that CGMs are just one metric and should be used in the context of overall health and awareness, and that continuous glucose monitoring is not necessarily for everyone.</p>

The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase the number of regular donors to over one million to ensure a reliable supply and prevent a "red alert," which would threaten public safety.

The vote is being billed as the biggest single vote by the profession ever launched in the UK, with the RCN arguing that nursing staff have endured over a decade of pay erosion.
