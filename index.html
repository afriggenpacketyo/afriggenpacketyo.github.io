          <h2>Scottish First Minister John Swinney Opposes Assisted Dying Bill</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First Minister John Swinney announced he will vote against the assisted dying bill in the Scottish Parliament, citing his religious faith and concerns about the impact on vulnerable individuals. Swinney fears that changing the law would alter the doctor-patient relationship and potentially pressure vulnerable people to end their lives prematurely. The bill, proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow terminally ill, mentally fit individuals to request medical assistance to end their lives. The vote on the bill is scheduled for May 13, marking the third time the Scottish Parliament has considered this issue, and Swinney's opposition could influence undecided MSPs.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge dismissed most claims against celebrities like Tom Brady and Stephen Curry who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The judge ruled that investors failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX's misconduct to be held liable. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in November 2022, which resulted in billions of dollars in customer losses. The plaintiffs alleged the celebrities were paid millions to endorse FTX without disclosing their financial incentives, violating advertising laws.</p>

          <p>Financial experts offer varying perspectives on gold investment allocations in light of economic uncertainty. Some suggest increasing gold holdings to 20-25% of a portfolio, citing global tensions and inflation, while others recommend maintaining the traditional 10-15% allocation for diversification. Experts generally advise against decreasing gold holdings unless liquidity is urgently needed, but suggest rebalancing to capture gains while prices are high. Key factors to consider include debt levels, inflation trends, currency strength, global instability, and an investor's age and time horizon.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, potentially easing the impact of recent tariff increases. While the extent of the agreement remains unknown, economists caution that it would likely generate only a small boost for Britain, which is still vulnerable to global economic uncertainty. The deal could support sectors like Britain's auto industry and lift consumer and business sentiment. However, the United States is an important trading partner, and trade flows are heavily skewed toward services, which were not affected by higher tariffs.</p>

While proponents argue it's appropriate since the U.S. protects the Gulf, opponents deem it juvenile and unnecessary.

The author suggests that while intelligence gathering is essential, the CIA's forays into regime change and assassination were damaging and that the agency should focus on foreign intelligence gathering and analysis.</p>

While the company's revenue surpassed expectations, its projected gross profit and revenue growth fell short of Wall Street's forecasts. Shopify acknowledged potential impacts from President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, including the expiration of a duty-free shipment loophole, but anticipates limited near-term effects. The company also introduced a "buy local" tool to support merchants amidst trade uncertainties.</p>
