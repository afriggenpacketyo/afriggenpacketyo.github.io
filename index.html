        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some of the largest labor unions in the United States, including the SEIU and the American Federation of Teachers, are playing a crucial role in organizing the nationwide "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration. Union leaders state their involvement is rooted in the belief that a voice in both the workplace and democracy is essential for the freedom and power of working people. They frame the demonstrations as a response to perceived abuses of power and a failure to address economic issues like healthcare and rising costs. The article highlights personal stories, such as a 75-year-old union member and cancer survivor, connecting the protests to lifelong struggles for civil rights and economic justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of Americans are anticipated to participate in the "No Kings" protests across all 50 states, with organizers planning over 2,700 events. The demonstrations are framed as a stand against what the coalition sees as the Trump administration's slide into authoritarianism, citing actions like the deployment of federal forces in cities and attempts to criminalize dissent. Despite allies of the administration labeling the events as anti-American, organizers and participants, including some Democratic senators, emphasize a commitment to nonviolent resistance. The protests aim to convey a message of resilience against fear and to voice concerns over the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is having a direct and visible impact on Capitol Hill, as U.S. Capitol Police officers continue to work without receiving their paychecks. This situation serves as a daily reminder to lawmakers of the real-world consequences of the political stalemate. The officers, who face increasing threats in their line of duty, are experiencing financial hardship, with their union chairman noting that banks and landlords do not offer a pass on payments. The impasse creates a significant strain on a force already feeling undervalued, raising concerns about morale and long-term retention.</p>

          <h2>New Ownership of Dominion Voting Systems Sparks Questions of Rebranding vs. Transformation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has been sold and rebranded as Liberty Vote by Scott Leiendecker, founder of election tech company KNOWiNK. The public announcement used partisan language, emphasizing a mission to "restore faith" in elections, which has raised concerns among nonpartisan observers and some election officials. However, private communications to existing county clients have stressed continuity with the "same team, same support," suggesting the change may be a strategic rebrand to appeal to conservative jurisdictions previously wary of the Dominion name. Officials are urging calm, noting the voting equipment and security protocols remain unchanged for now.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has confirmed that remains recently returned from Gaza are those of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old hostage who was killed during the October 7th attack on the Nir Oz kibbutz. His body had been taken into Gaza, and his death was previously announced by Israeli authorities in December 2023. This marks the 10th instance of a deceased hostage's remains being repatriated, though many others are still unreturned, causing significant anger in Israel. The U.S. has downplayed suggestions that Hamas's inability to return all bodies constitutes a breach of the recent ceasefire agreement, citing the practical difficulties of recovery amid the destruction in Gaza.</p>

          <p>High-level delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government are scheduled to hold emergency talks in Doha, Qatar, following a week of intense border clashes that have resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. The violence escalated after deadly blasts in Afghanistan, for which Kabul blamed Islamabad, leading to retaliatory accusations and military actions from both sides. A brief 48-hour truce failed to hold, with Pakistan conducting airstrikes in Afghanistan's Paktika province. The central issue remains mutual accusations of sheltering militants who launch cross-border attacks, a charge both governments deny.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former U.S. Representative George Santos, leading to his immediate release. Santos had served less than three months after being convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited what he described as horrible mistreatment of Santos in prison and praised the ex-lawmaker's consistent Republican voting record. The decision, which followed a public plea from Santos, has drawn sharp criticism from both Democratic leaders and several New York Republicans who had initially pushed for his expulsion from Congress.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded nearly $20 million in damages to six bystanders who were injured during a 2022 shooting involving Denver police in the city's Lower Downtown area. The incident occurred when officers opened fire on a suspect who had drawn a handgun, but the gunfire also struck several people in the surrounding crowd. One officer involved, Brandon Ramos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and resigned from the force after a grand jury found he was not in immediate danger and failed to account for the crowd. The verdict sends a strong message regarding police conduct and accountability for public safety.</p>

This marks another shift in his position, moving away from recent suggestions that Ukraine could win back all its territory. During the meeting, Trump also expressed hesitation about providing Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles for national defense.</p>

Walton expressed disappointment with the sentence, arguing it was too lenient for a woman he described as an "inveterate con woman" with a long history of scams, including impersonating Jennifer Aniston.

Results from a trial in North America involving 25,000 adults showed the test identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with cancer later confirmed in 62% of those positive cases. Crucially, more than half of the cancers were found at an early stage, and three-quarters were types that currently have no routine screening program, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer.

          <p>In an extensive interview, Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers discusses his lifelong passion for football, tracing his journey from a childhood dream to managing some of Britain's biggest clubs. He recounts how an early injury made him left-footed and shares that his first 11-a-side game was not until age 13. Rodgers highlights the Swansea vs. Reading play-off final as a pivotal match that propelled him into the Premier League. He describes managing Celtic as a unique and immense pressure, greater than many other top jobs, due to the constant expectation to win in a specific style, and states his next career goal is to reach 1,000 games as a manager.</p>

          <p>Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, believes that Donald Trump is the only world leader who can compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC, Stubb argued that convincing Russia requires more of a "stick" than a "carrot," and that Trump is the one capable of applying the necessary pressure. His comments came ahead of a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, after which Trump announced plans to meet with Putin. Stubb also reaffirmed that Finland would never recognize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories and supports Ukraine's path to EU and NATO membership.</p>

          <p>After his father's death, Antony Easton discovered a hidden suitcase that revealed his family's secret history as wealthy German Jews named Eisner, whose fortune was stolen during the Nazi era. The contents led him on a decade-long investigation, uncovering a multi-billion-pound steel empire, lavish properties, and a collection of art lost to forced sales and Aryanization. Easton learned his grandparents entrusted their assets to a non-Jewish associate, Martin Hartig, who then claimed them as his own. While legal recourse for the property is gone, the investigation has led to the successful restitution of some artworks, including a painting from a Berlin museum.</p>

          <p>Dozens of South Korean nationals detained in Cambodia for their alleged involvement in cyberscam operations have been repatriated and were arrested upon their arrival in South Korea. The suspects landed at Incheon International Airport and were immediately taken into custody to face a criminal investigation. They are implicated in various fraudulent activities, including voice phishing and romance scams. The repatriation follows a public outcry in South Korea over the death of a student who was reportedly tortured and killed after being forced to work in a Cambodian scam center, prompting Seoul to increase cooperation with Phnom Penh to combat these criminal networks.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will give up his titles, including the Duke of York, as controversy continues over his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The decision, which various newspapers report came after intense pressure from the King, is seen by Buckingham Palace as an attempt to end distractions for the monarchy. While Andrew used the announcement to once again "vigorously" deny the allegations against him, the move is being widely interpreted as his exile from public life. Newspaper editorials have largely framed the decision as a necessary and overdue step to protect the institution.</p>

          <p>The South African SUV market is undergoing a significant shift, with Chinese automotive brands experiencing a remarkable 86% increase in sales volume in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year. This growth, led by manufacturers like Chery and Haval, has boosted the total market share for Chinese OEMs to 15%. While Japanese brands Toyota and Suzuki remain the volume leaders, their market dominance is eroding as they have both recorded a decline in market share. The trend highlights the growing consumer acceptance and competitive pricing of Chinese vehicles in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

At the plate, he hit three home runs, becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to hit a leadoff homer and just the 12th player ever to hit three in a postseason game. The performance, which earned him NLCS MVP honors, broke him out of a significant postseason slump and solidified his team's status as favorites to defend their championship title.</p>

          <p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong have caused such extensive damage to remote Alaskan villages that many of the 2,000 displaced residents may not be able to return home for at least 18 months. In a request for a major disaster declaration, Governor Mike Dunleavy reported that in one village, Kipnuk, 90% of homes have been destroyed by the storm surge and flooding. Evacuees are being airlifted to shelters in larger communities like Anchorage, where officials are working on short and long-term housing solutions. The disaster has struck a region where residents rely on hunting and fishing, forcing a difficult transition to urban life for the foreseeable future.</p>
