        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, President Trump hinted at the possibility of regime change in Iran, raising concerns about further escalation. This follows U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, which Trump claimed had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear capabilities, although the IAEA believes Iran may have moved some enriched uranium. Israel has also expanded its targets in Iran, striking sites linked to the regime's domestic authority, including Evin Prison. Iran has responded with missile attacks on Israel, and its foreign minister is seeking support from Russia. The U.S. State Department has issued a global alert, urging Americans to exercise caution due to potential anti-U.S. sentiment.</p>

          <p>Several tankers are diverting course away from the Strait of Hormuz due to rising concerns about potential disruptions following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Data indicates that at least six vessels, including crude carriers and chemical tankers, initially changed their routes away from the strait. However, some of these vessels have since resumed their course towards the Strait of Hormuz, suggesting a fluid and evolving situation. Despite the initial diversions, the overall flow of vessels into the region appears to be sustained, indicating that the impact on trade is still uncertain.</p>

          <p>Uranium, a naturally occurring radioactive element, is more common than gold and found in trace amounts in rocks, soil, water, and air. It is used in both enriched and depleted forms, with enriched uranium serving as fuel for nuclear power plants and weapons, while depleted uranium is used for radiation shielding and armor-piercing projectiles. The concentration of uranium in the environment is generally low, but higher concentrations in drinking water can pose health risks, though the carcinogenic effects are unclear. Uranium can enter the environment through industrial works and mining, with Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia being major producers.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to ban Palestine Action under anti-terror laws, effectively branding the group a terrorist organization. This decision follows a protest in central London and an incident where activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, spray-painting military planes red. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the vandalism as a "disgraceful attack" and stated that the group has a "long history of unacceptable criminal damage." If the ban is passed in Parliament, membership or support of the group will become a criminal offense, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Cooper clarified that this decision is specific to Palestine Action and does not affect other groups campaigning on issues related to Palestine or the Middle East.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. military strikes Iran's nuclear sites, China's support for Iran appears restrained, balancing its alliance with Tehran against its own economic interests and limited influence over Israel. China has avoided direct condemnation of Israel, focusing instead on brokering dialogue and a ceasefire, seeking to contain the conflict's spillover effects on the wider region. While China has pledged support for Iran, its primary economic interest lies in access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz, a key route for global crude oil flows. Some analysts suggest China may benefit from the chaos in the Middle East, as it could pose a distraction for Washington, but a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could be favorable for China as well.</p>

Iran has responded with missile launches towards Israel, and the U.S. Department of State has issued a global warning advising U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution.

          <p>Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has announced a stock buyback program of up to $400 million. The company's stock experienced a slight increase following the announcement, and the buyback could include both common stock and warrants, with repurchased shares being retired. This decision comes after Trump Media raised $2.5 billion last month, planning to use the funds to buy bitcoin and launch Trump-branded exchange-traded funds. CEO Devin Nunes stated that the buyback would support strong shareholder returns as the company explores strategic opportunities.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has announced a proposal to allow non-domiciled residents (non-doms) to avoid some UK taxes by paying a Â£250,000 fee, with the proceeds directed to the lowest-paid workers. Under this plan, non-doms would receive a Britannia Card, exempting them from taxes on wealth, income, and capital gains earned abroad, as well as inheritance tax. The party estimates that this policy would generate between Â£1.5 billion and Â£2.5 billion annually, providing Â£600 to Â£1,000 per low-paid worker. Critics argue that this measure amounts to a tax cut for foreign billionaires, potentially requiring cuts to public services or increased taxes to offset the revenue loss.</p>

Phrases like "Because I said so" and "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, making them less receptive. Instead, Raouda suggests using empathetic and respectful language that acknowledges a child's feelings while still holding boundaries.
