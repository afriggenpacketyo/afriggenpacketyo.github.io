          <p>Tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ supporters and allies participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban recently enabled by controversial legislation from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. Organizers reported a record turnout, framing the event as a broader protest for civil liberties in Hungary. The city's mayor circumvented the national ban by declaring the parade a municipal event, and the march received significant support from numerous international embassies and EU officials, highlighting growing tensions between Hungary and the European Union over democratic values.</p>

          <p>Thousands of nationalist protesters gathered in Bangkok to demand the resignation of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra over her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. The dissatisfaction stems from a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former prime minister, Hun Sen, intended to de-escalate tensions following a border skirmish. Critics accused Shinawatra of being overly deferential in the call, fueling public anger and leading to organized protests calling for her to step down, despite her subsequent apology for her comments.</p>

          <p>The victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the party. Moderate Democrats and business leaders are reportedly strategizing to prevent his election in November, with some considering backing an independent challenger. In contrast, progressive figures like former Mayor Bill de Blasio have embraced the win, arguing it reflects the majority's will. Mamdani is now engaging with concerned business executives while navigating a complex political landscape with mixed reactions from local and national Democratic leaders.</p>

England's batting lineup struggled in response, collapsing to 113 all out, with debutante spinner Shree Charani taking four wickets.

Head coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking flair, particularly fly-half Finn Russell's creative play, but noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed as the tour continues.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian man has been sentenced and ordered removed from the U.S. after pleading guilty to kicking a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the detector dog, a 5-year-old beagle named Freddie, alerted to the man's luggage during an inspection. The man kicked the 25-pound dog with enough force to lift it off the ground, causing rib contusions. Authorities discovered he was attempting to smuggle over 100 pounds of undeclared and prohibited agricultural products.</p>

The piece suggests that for Democrats to move forward, they must stop relitigating the past and focus on identifying a new generation of national leadership for 2028.</p>

Another 10% should consist of elements that can be improved over time, such as cosmetic fixtures or paint.

This trend is viewed as dangerous and contrary to Gabbard's stated goal of rooting out politicization within the intelligence community, raising questions about the future of the national security apparatus.</p>
