        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United States federal judge, April Perry, issued a temporary injunction blocking President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, including Chicago. The Trump administration had justified the deployment by citing violent protests and the need to protect federal facilities and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, labeling Chicago a "war zone." However, local Democratic officials accused the president of politically motivated actions and overreach, asserting that the state's law enforcement agencies were perfectly sufficient. Judge Perry expressed significant skepticism about the federal government's claims of widespread violence, suggesting the deployment was largely rooted in Trump's "animus" toward Illinois elected officials, with the order effective for two weeks as the legal battle continues.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern Philippines, leading to immediate tsunami warnings across the region. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology issued a severe alert, expecting destructive wave heights and strongly advising coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground or move inland. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated that authorities are actively assessing the situation and preparing to deploy search-and-rescue teams once it is safe. The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast waves up to three meters for threatened areas, with warnings also extending to Indonesia and Palau, underscoring the widespread potential impact of this seismic event.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly unveiled new measures to combat intense, "disorderly price competition" within several key industries. The policy aims to prevent destructive price wars and "self-destructive cost-cutting practices" that are detrimental to industry development, product innovation, and overall quality. Authorities will guide industry associations to evaluate average production costs and assist companies in setting reasonable prices, intervening with warnings, cost investigations, and price inspections when price wars are suspected. This initiative underscores the government's commitment to fostering healthy economic development and maintaining market order in vital sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A principal software engineer at Microsoft, Scott Sutfin-Glowski, has resigned after 13 years, citing the company's continued sale of cloud services to the Israeli military amidst the Gaza conflict. Sutfin-Glowski stated he "can no longer accept enabling what may be the worst atrocities of our time," referencing numerous active Microsoft subscriptions held by Israel's military. His departure follows months of internal employee protests and firings over the company's involvement, even after Microsoft reportedly stopped providing certain services to a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The engineer further criticized Microsoft for allegedly cutting communication systems that allowed employees to raise concerns about the military's use of its products.</p>

Taiwan continues to face escalating military and political pressure from Beijing, which views the democratically governed island as its own territory. Lai affirmed Taiwan's commitment to increasing defense spending and will propose a special military budget by year-end, emphasizing its necessity for countering threats and developing the island's defense industries. This strategic initiative underscores Taiwan's determination to bolster its defenses against a significantly larger Chinese military and maintain regional stability.</p>

          <p>Chinese chip stocks have experienced a remarkable 55% rally since June, fueled by Beijing's push for self-sufficiency in domestic technology and a directive to avoid Nvidia processors. However, this rapid surge has led to "lofty valuations," prompting some investors to express caution. Fund managers like Ng Xin-Yao of Aberdeen Investments worry that such high multiples leave little room for error, questioning the market's patience if these companies fail to deliver on expectations. This situation contrasts with the 20-30% gains seen in chip stocks across the US, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, highlighting unique market dynamics in China. (not investment advice)</p>

The indictment alleges James secured a lower interest rate on a Norfolk, Virginia, home mortgage by misrepresenting it as a secondary residence, while actually using it as an investment rental property. James vehemently denies the "baseless" charges, accusing President Trump of "desperate weaponization of our justice system" for political retribution, following his public calls for investigations into her.

          <p>The war in Ukraine is evolving into an AI arms race, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces deploying and testing AI-assisted military technologies. Ukrainian defense consultant Serhiy Beskrestnov identified a new Russian drone capable of autonomous targeting and undetectable by jamming, highlighting a significant threat. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Yuriy Myronenko confirmed AI analyzes vast amounts of frontline video data to identify targets, and Ukrainian troops are using AI software for drones to autonomously complete missions. While developers are cautious about fully autonomous weapons due to friendly fire risks, President Zelensky has called for global rules on AI in warfare, underscoring the urgency of this technological shift.</p>

          <p>A stalemate in Congress over reopening the government is jeopardizing Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democrats insist on extending these subsidies before any budget agreement, while Republicans demand the government reopen first. Without these federal tax credits, an estimated 3.8 million Americans, including 2 million by next year, will likely be unable to afford health insurance, as average ACA premiums could more than double. This looming crisis could lead to significant financial debt and delayed medical care for vulnerable populations, particularly in states that have not expanded Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Texas Court Stays Execution of Robert Roberson Amid Doubts Over Shaken Baby Syndrome Diagnosis</h2>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has halted the execution of Robert Roberson, scheduled for next week, who was convicted of capital murder in his 2-year-old daughter Nikki's 2002 death. Roberson's defense argues he is innocent, contending Nikki died from severe pneumonia, not shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis now questioned by new medical research. The court's ruling orders the trial court to re-evaluate Roberson's arguments under Texas' "junk science" law, which allows convictions to be challenged if the underlying scientific evidence is no longer credible. This decision reflects growing concerns about past convictions based on shaken baby syndrome, with dozens of exonerations since 1992.</p>

          <p>A near-complete skeleton found on Dorset's Jurassic coast has been identified as Xiphodracon goldencapensis, a new species of ichthyosaur dubbed the "sword dragon of Dorset." This dolphin-sized marine reptile, approximately 3 meters long, swam the seas about 185 million years ago, a period from which ichthyosaur fossils are exceptionally rare. Distinctive features include a prong-like bone near its nostril and a long, sword-like snout used for hunting fish and squid. Intriguingly, marks on its skull suggest it may have been killed by a bite from a larger predator, potentially another ichthyosaur, adding context to its ancient existence.</p>

          <p>"Tron: Ares," the third installment in the sci-fi franchise, features a mid-credits scene that strongly hints at future narrative directions and the return of a classic villain. The film, starring Jared Leto as the AI Ares and Greta Lee as Eve Kim, concludes its main story with Julian Dillinger, the grandson of the original "Tron" antagonist, escaping into the Grid. The mid-credits sequence shows Julian activating his identity disc, causing his digital suit to resemble Sark's, a villainous program from the first film. Additionally, the movie ends by teasing a potential meeting between Ares and Quorra, a character introduced in "Tron: Legacy."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles firefighters did not use thermal imaging technology to detect lingering embers after a New Year’s Day fire in Pacific Palisades, a critical oversight that led to a destructive rekindle days later. Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva stated the technology was not employed due to the 8-acre fire's size and the deep chaparral, despite federal prosecutors charging an Uber driver with intentionally starting the initial blaze. The subsequent Palisades fire killed 12 people, charred 23,400 acres, and destroyed over 6,800 structures. An LAFD after-action report acknowledged shortcomings and recommended deploying drones with infrared for future fires over an acre, highlighting a major failure in protocol.</p>

          <p>The United States has commenced a controversial financial rescue plan for Argentina, purchasing Argentine pesos and finalizing a $20 billion currency swap line to stabilize the country's severe currency crisis. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the move, asserting that Argentina's stability is a strategic interest for the U.S. and the Western Hemisphere. The decision has drawn criticism domestically, with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren questioning the allocation of funds while Americans face healthcare cost issues. Argentina's President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, thanked the U.S. for its support, but the plan also faces backlash from American farmers concerned about trade shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 867 into law, effectively banning the elective declawing of cats across the state. The new legislation restricts veterinarians from performing the procedure—which involves amputating the first bone in each toe or severing tendons—limiting it strictly to cases of medical necessity. Animal welfare advocates and lawmakers have long argued that declawing is an outdated and inhumane practice performed for the convenience of pet owners. While the California Veterinary Medical Association opposed the bill, citing concerns about limiting professional scope, California joins New York and numerous other countries in prohibiting this practice.</p>

U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that Lamar's criticisms, including the controversial line "I hear you like ’em young," did not constitute defamation because a "reasonable listener could not have concluded that ‘Not Like Us’ was conveying objective facts about Drake." Drake had alleged UMG endangered his life and devalued his music, but the court found the song's context within a rap battle crucial.</p>

          <p>Firefighters and advocates are raising alarms over a significant increase in fires occurring in trash bins, garbage trucks, and waste-collection facilities, a trend dubbed the "vape effect." This surge is attributed to lithium-ion batteries from improperly discarded vaping devices, with July alone seeing a record 56 publicly reported fires in the U.S. and Canada. These fires pose serious safety threats to waste workers, disrupt essential services, and contribute to environmental pollution through heavy metals. Public awareness campaigns like "Battery Safety Now" are urging proper disposal of battery-containing devices at specialized facilities, while some countries have implemented outright bans on single-use vapes.</p>
