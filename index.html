          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has seen a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes reaching $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This surge, driven by Chinese companies seeking listings, positions the city to potentially surpass Nasdaq and the NYSE. The revival is attributed to factors like supportive policies from Beijing, a slowdown in mainland A-share listings, and U.S. delisting fears. High-profile listings and significant capital inflows from mainland investors have fueled the market's strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

Conservative members of the Freedom Caucus are concerned about the fiscal impact, while moderate Republicans worry about constituents losing healthcare coverage.

The January executive order had characterized the border situation as an "invasion."

Powell, who was nominated by Trump, recently suggested that rate cuts would have already occurred if not for the economic impact of the administration's tariff policies. The president's ability to remove a Fed chair is legally questionable, and Powell has previously stated he would not step down if asked. (not investment advice)</p>

The police watchdog reported that some documents provided by the council had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value. This practice particularly affected long-running investigations like Operation Green Jacket, which was launched six years ago. The council cited complex data-sharing rules, but a new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted information has since been established between the agencies.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, prosecutors detailed the key evidence that linked him to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The case was built on cell phone tracking that placed him near the crime scene multiple times, and crucial DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene. Investigators matched this DNA to Kohberger by secretly obtaining a Q-tip from his family's trash. The evidence also showed Kohberger had meticulously cleaned his car and apartment, but the combination of DNA and digital surveillance created a powerful case against him.</p>

          <h2>Experts Analyze Significant Shift of Latino Voters Towards Trump in 2024 Election</h2>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this rightward shift is not necessarily ideological but reflects a growing populist sentiment among Latino voters. Analysts point to disillusionment with the Democratic Party's immigration policies and a perceived failure to address the economic concerns of the working class. The trend indicates a dynamic and evolving electorate that both major parties have struggled to fully understand or cater to.</p>

          <p>The endangered Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73 individuals, faces increasing threats from a declining food source. Their primary prey, the Chinook salmon, is also endangered due to habitat destruction. Conservation groups are concerned that a proposed Trump administration change to the Endangered Species Act could worsen the situation. The change would narrow the definition of "harm" to exclude habitat damage, potentially opening protected areas to industrial development and further jeopardizing the survival of both species.</p>

          <p>A jury has ordered a man who participated in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot to pay $500,000 to the widow of D.C. Police Officer Jeffrey Smith. The wrongful death lawsuit found that David Walls-Kaufman had assaulted Officer Smith during the insurrection. Smith died by suicide nine days after the riot, with his widow successfully arguing that the trauma and injuries he sustained that day led directly to his death. His death has since been officially designated as "in the line of duty," and his widow continues to advocate for recognition for other officers who have died by suicide due to on-the-job injuries.</p>

          <p>Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of hairstylist Fabio Sementilli, now claims his former lover and the victim's wife, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. In a jailhouse interview, Baker insisted that Monica had no knowledge of the murder plot, a statement that could be a bombshell in her upcoming trial for conspiracy. Prosecutors allege Monica masterminded the killing of her husband, pointing to circumstantial evidence like the use of encrypted apps between the lovers. Baker's potential testimony creates a risky but potentially powerful development for the defense.</p>

          <p>A group of former federal health officials has warned that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could have severe negative health consequences for Americans. The proposed 2026 budget would slash the CDC's funding by over 50%, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The officials argued that these cuts would cripple state and local health departments, which rely heavily on federal funding. They predicted that defunding successful programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention would ultimately lead to more illness and unnecessary deaths.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon believes that recent U.S. strikes on three key Iranian facilities have set back the country's nuclear program by approximately one to two years, according to a defense department spokesperson. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's claim that the program was "completely destroyed." The evaluation is based on intelligence suggesting that centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site were destroyed. The extent of the setback remains a subject of debate, as Iran has since suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, making verification more difficult.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing a challenging financial situation after government concessions on welfare reforms significantly reduced projected savings, nearly eliminating her Â£10 billion fiscal buffer. With the Autumn Budget approaching, her options are limited. The article outlines five potential paths: waiting for economic growth, finding new spending cuts, changing self-imposed fiscal rules, reducing the frequency of official forecasts, or raising revenue through measures like extending the freeze on tax thresholds. Labour's pledge not to raise key taxes further constrains her ability to replenish government coffers. (not investment advice)</p>
