LeBlanc defended Canada's retaliatory measures and highlighted the strategic importance of sectors like steel and aluminum for national security. He noted that constructive conversations with U.S. officials are ongoing, aiming for an agreement to reduce tariffs and provide economic certainty.</p>

          <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham voiced strong opposition to a new Republican healthcare plan, arguing it creates unmanageable paperwork and threatens rural hospitals. Speaking on "Face the Nation," she stated that while her state is currently financially stable, the proposed long-term cuts to Medicaid would be catastrophic, costing New Mexico billions. Grisham contended that the $50 billion federal fund for rural healthcare is insufficient to prevent widespread closures and economic collapse in affected areas. She also differentiated her use of the National Guard for support roles from what she termed indiscriminate federal actions.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat on Saturday. The collision reportedly caused the vessel to nearly capsize and threw a passenger overboard, who is believed to be unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions, a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death is scheduled for Monday, and boaters are being advised to use caution in the area.</p>

In a video, she revealed she is still recovering from "very bad brain trauma" after being knocked unconscious while reportedly trying to intervene in the brawl. Four of six alleged assailants have been arrested in connection with the incident, which police say was witnessed by about 100 people.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a self-imposed deadline, the United States and Canada have not yet reached a new trade agreement, extending a six-month tariff war. While both nations face pressure to resolve the dispute, analysts suggest Canada is not rushing into a "bad deal," partly because the existing USMCA trade pact provides a buffer, leaving most exports duty-free. Canadian officials remain publicly optimistic about continuing cordial negotiations to lower tariffs on key sectors like steel and autos. Recent Canadian policy shifts on defense spending and a digital tax may also be intended to address U.S. concerns and aid the talks. (not investment advice)</p>

Following a jobs report with downward revisions, President Trump accused the commissioner of rigging the numbers, a claim Hassett supported by citing the revisions as "hard evidence" of patterns that "could make people wonder." Hassett denied the firing was retaliation for weak jobs numbers, stating the president "wants his own people there" for more transparency.

Experts attribute the decline to multiple crises, including the pandemic, inflation, and climate change, which create uncertainty for young people. While some view the choice to be childless as a matter of female self-determination, sociologists point to a "fertility gap," where people desire more children than they have.

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic envisions what tours at U.S. national parks might sound like if they were altered to avoid any content that could be seen as disparaging to American history. The piece humorously rewrites tour guide scripts for sites like the Stonewall National Monument, Manzanar, and the Selma to Montgomery Trail to focus only on "natural beauty" while comically sidestepping historical conflict or social justice issues. For example, the Civil War is described as being "fought over nothing," and Harriet Tubman is portrayed as a nature enthusiast. The satire critiques recent efforts to control historical narratives at national sites.</p>

          <p>China has granted export approval to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, a move that provides a timely alternative market for Brazil's coffee industry. The decision comes as Brazilian exporters face a new 50% U.S. tariff on their products, set to begin on August 6. The U.S. is a massive market for Brazilian coffee, importing nearly 8 million bags annually, valued at $4.4 billion over the past year. While China is a much smaller market currently, these new five-year export permits represent a significant opportunity for Brazilian producers to diversify and mitigate the impact of the U.S. trade measures.

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi left Saturday's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes due to an apparent hamstring injury. The 38-year-old forward went down after a challenge, and after being attended to by trainers, he walked directly to the locker room. Coach Javier Mascherano stated that Messi felt a "pull" and will undergo testing to determine the severity of the injury, putting his availability for Wednesday's match in jeopardy. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about managing Messi's workload, as he has dealt with several leg injuries over the past few seasons.</p>

This was reportedly one of several Ukrainian drone strikes over the weekend targeting Russian energy infrastructure in cities including Ryazan and Voronezh.

Parsons, who is seeking a contract extension that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL, posted on social media that he wants to leave the team. Jones insisted the situation is a normal part of high-stakes contract talks and that an agreement framework is already in place from previous discussions. Despite the public standoff, Parsons' teammates have voiced their support for him, and Jones expressed confidence that the dispute will be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

Jordan, the site's custodian, called the visit an "unacceptable provocation," and Palestinian leaders described it as a dangerous escalation.

Some critics on social media have called the "genes" campaign tone-deaf and suggestive of eugenics, while conservatives have defended it as a blow against "woke" culture. Sweeney has not commented on her voter registration, but previously faced scrutiny over a family party with guests in MAGA-style hats.</p>

The article points to recent examples, such as a long, rambling monologue about windmills and a confabulated story about his uncle and the Unabomber, as evidence of potential cognitive decline. Mental health experts quoted in the piece describe his behavior as showing signs of digression, confabulation, and an inability to complete a thought, a significant deterioration from his articulation in past decades. The White House has aggressively pushed back, asserting the president is "mentally and physically sharper than ever before."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to divorce attorneys, individuals in a rocky marriage can take steps to protect their finances even without a prenuptial agreement. The first key step is to become fully informed about all shared assets and liabilities while still married, as access to accountants and financial records is easier. The second recommendation is to consider a postnuptial agreement, or "postnup," which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While broaching the topic can be difficult, having these clear financial understandings can provide security and prevent more significant conflicts later on. (not investment advice)</p>

The article outlines seven calming phrases that emotionally attuned parents use to validate a child's feelings and make them feel safe, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you." This approach avoids punishments and recognizes that a tantrum is a sign of nervous system distress. By reassuring children and setting boundaries with compassion, parents can help them regulate their emotions more effectively and reduce the frequency of future meltdowns.</p>

This follows criticism from the Foreign Affairs Committee that the government had previously declined to support such a medical evacuation scheme.
