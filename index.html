          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into former President Joe Biden and his aides, alleging a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline through the use of an autopen. The order cites executive actions by Biden and suggests that the use of a mechanical signature pen could impact the legality of numerous actions. Biden has dismissed the allegations as false and a distraction, while legal experts note that presidents have used autopens for decades. This move intensifies the scrutiny over Biden's mental acuity.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of feather fossils trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study, dating back 99 million years, shows how birds surpassed dinosaurs in conquering the skies. Researchers found that the development of feathers that generated thrust and lift was essential for bird evolution. While many dinosaurs had feathers, they lacked the same ability to fly as modern birds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has stated that Columbia University has failed to meet accreditation standards due to alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws. The department claims the university tolerated harassment of Jewish students on campus after the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, has been notified of the alleged violation. The accreditation process determines eligibility for federal student loans and Pell Grants.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that specific bacteria, Bifidobacterium longum, halved the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more common in babies born via vaginal delivery.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The order halts restart efforts on the onshore pipeline system, which had a major rupture in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public input. The ruling pushes back Sable's target for first sales to August 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested the FDA to review data on mifepristone, the abortion pill. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, despite previous FDA approvals and periodic reviews finding no new safety concerns. Experts argue that concerns about safety are misguided and fueled by a report from an advocacy group lacking medical training. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge targeting the availability of mifepristone in 2024.</p>
