          <p>President Trump granted an unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, a Virginia sheriff convicted of federal bribery charges. Jenkins, who was set to report to jail, was praised by Trump as a wonderful person persecuted by the Radical Left. Trump criticized the Biden Department of Justice for an overzealous prosecution, claiming Jenkins was denied the opportunity to present exculpatory evidence during his trial. Jenkins was convicted in December 2024 on multiple charges related to accepting over $75,000 in cash payments for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. </p>

The most severely wounded were in critical but stable condition at area hospitals, according to the Horry County Police Department.

          <p>Peter R. Orszag, former budget director under President Obama, argues that the U.S.'s fiscal situation has deteriorated significantly, posing risks to the dollar's global status. He points to rising annual federal budget deficits, increased interest rates on 10-year Treasuries, and growing federal debt as a share of GDP. Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and pursuing fiscal savings in entitlement programs. He notes that the current budget legislation moving through Congress would exacerbate these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set three of its mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, viewing it as a check on the state's influence. They argue that California's policies, particularly the ban on new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035, are impractical for rural states with long driving distances. Republicans also framed the issue ideologically, suggesting California's policies represent a broader liberal agenda rejected by the American public.

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts in North America and England after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. The condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to the need for physical therapy and abstaining from performing. Joel expressed his regret for disappointing his audience and gratitude for their understanding. The condition can cause problems with walking, bladder control, and thinking, and may be treated with surgery to install a tube to drain excess fluid.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for a wind-down to the war in Gaza, signaling a shift in tone from previous unwavering support for Israel. This comes as other allies, including Germany and Italy, have expressed increasing criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. Britain, Canada, and France have also issued a joint statement criticizing Israel's expanded operations. These actions suggest that Israel's strongest partners are beginning to lose patience with Prime Minister Netanyahu, although they continue to provide practical support.</p>

LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April, encompasses not only unemployed workers but also those seeking full-time employment, and those in poverty-wage jobs. The report argues that the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate has flaws, such as counting individuals as employed if they have worked as little as one hour in the prior two weeks.
