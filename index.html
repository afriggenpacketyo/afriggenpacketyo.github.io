          <p>The Kremlin has announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which is expected to take place in the coming days. According to a Putin adviser, preparations for the summit have already begun, although a specific date and location have not yet been disclosed. The adviser mentioned that a trilateral meeting including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had been suggested but confirmed the upcoming talks would be exclusively between the U.S. and Russian leaders. This development follows a meeting between Putin and a U.S. special envoy aimed at finding a resolution to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, describing him as "highly CONFLICTED" in a social media post. The call follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton questioning Tan's investment ties to Chinese companies, some reportedly linked to the country's military, and raising national security concerns. Intel's stock fell following the president's statement, adding pressure on the company which is already undergoing significant spending cuts and a strategic reset under Tan's leadership. Intel is a major recipient of U.S. government funding intended to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has declared that the FBI would be "unwelcome" in his state if they attempted to pursue Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled to avoid a redistricting vote. Pritzker asserted that the Texas legislators have not broken any federal laws, rendering any federal intervention illegitimate, and dismissed calls for FBI involvement by Senator John Cornyn as political "grandstanding." The dispute stems from Texas Democrats leaving their state to break quorum and block a Republican-led special session on congressional redistricting. This has created a tense political and jurisdictional standoff between Democratic-led states offering sanctuary and Texas Republicans seeking to compel the lawmakers' return.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced his instruction to the Commerce Department to begin work on a "new" census that would, for the first time, exclude undocumented immigrants from the population counts used for congressional apportionment. The directive revives a controversial effort from his first term that faced significant legal challenges. The 14th Amendment has historically been interpreted to require counting the "whole number of persons in each state," and critics argue the move is unconstitutional and designed to shift political power. The Census Bureau's own research has warned that such a move could produce inaccurate data and discourage participation from immigrant communities.</p>

CEO David Zaslav highlighted the significant turnaround for the motion picture division, which has been a focus of rebuilding efforts since the 2022 merger. The company expressed confidence in continued momentum, projecting at least $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the full year for the studios segment and noting the strong opening of "Superman" will boost third-quarter results.</p>

For homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, this will likely lead to lower monthly payments, though those on fixed rates will see no immediate change. Conversely, the rate cut is unfavorable for savers, as interest paid on savings accounts is expected to fall further, diminishing returns, especially with inflation forecast to rise. The central bank's decision aims to stimulate the economy and support the jobs market, but it creates a challenging environment for those relying on savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 92 people, mostly Ethiopians, have drowned after their overcrowded vessel sank while crossing the Bab al-Mandab Strait from Djibouti to Yemen. The incident highlights the extreme dangers of the so-called "Eastern Route," which is increasingly used by migrants fleeing economic crisis and conflict in the Horn of Africa to seek work in wealthy Gulf states. According to the IOM, smugglers often use small, overloaded boats, and there is no official sea rescue program in the perilous strait. Those who survive the crossing face further dangers, including abuse and extortion in war-torn Yemen.</p>

Agnifilo clarified that his focus is on securing a favorable sentence and that he has not spoken to anyone connected to the president about a pardon.

The majority of the world's most advanced chips are produced in Taiwan by TSMC, creating a heavy reliance that has fueled geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. President Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors to encourage more manufacturing within the United States, citing economic and national security concerns. However, the policy includes exemptions for companies that invest in U.S.-based production, which could spare major players like TSMC and Samsung.</p>

Experts suggest Putin may be engaging in dialogue to stave off further U.S. sanctions or to persuade Trump of Russia's stance, given their past interactions.

Prosecutors have released a handwritten letter in which Boelter allegedly confessed, but his motive remains unclear, though he had compiled lists of other politicians. The case is being treated as a "political assassination," and the murder charges could potentially carry the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly has raised its full-year financial outlook after reporting second-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by soaring demand for its diabetes and weight loss drugs. Sales for Mounjaro and Zepbound reached nearly $5.2 billion and $3.38 billion respectively, both beating expectations. The pharmaceutical giant now projects 2025 sales between $60 billion and $62 billion. However, the company's stock dipped in premarket trading after late-stage trial data for its experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron, showed weight loss results that were below what some investors had hoped for, tempering the otherwise strong report.</p>

          <p>A wide-ranging set of new U.S. tariffs, impacting over 90 countries, has officially come into effect as part of President Trump's strategy to reshape global trade and boost domestic manufacturing. The move follows a period of negotiation, after which countries that did not secure new trade deals with the U.S. face higher import taxes. Export-dependent economies in Southeast Asia are among the hardest hit, with some facing levies as high as 40%. The implementation provides some certainty after months of market chaos, though it solidifies a higher average U.S. tariff rate, the highest in nearly a century, potentially impacting global supply chains and consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Peloton surprised Wall Street by posting a net income of $21.6 million for its fiscal fourth quarter, a significant improvement from the loss reported a year earlier. The positive result was driven by better-than-expected sales and aggressive cost-cutting measures. However, the company also announced it will lay off another 6% of its global workforce as part of a new plan to reduce operating expenses by an additional $100 million. Under new CEO Peter Stern, Peloton is focused on achieving sustained profitability and free cash flow, but the continued layoffs signal ongoing challenges in stabilizing the business post-pandemic.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its launch by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett, the Giving Pledge has seen its enrollment of new billionaires slow down, according to a report from the Institute for Policy Studies. Initially, 14% of America's billionaires signed the nonbinding commitment to donate at least half their wealth, but that figure has now dropped to 12%. While the pledge has fostered a community for philanthropy among the ultra-wealthy, its overall growth has stagnated even as the number of billionaires and their collective wealth has surged. The report suggests that rapid wealth growth and a shift towards impact investing may be contributing factors.</p>

          <p>A sweeping domestic bill passed by Congress, which includes new work requirements for Medicaid, is predicted to have a devastating impact on children's healthcare. Although the legislation does not directly target children, experts warn that changes to Medicaid financing and rules that will cause millions of adults to lose coverage will have a cascading effect. Because nearly half of American children are enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, the law is expected to increase the number of uninsured children, slash funding for in-home care for those with disabilities, and exacerbate the strain on an already fragile pediatric hospital system.</p>

          <p>An analysis details how Israel's use of starvation in Gaza constitutes a distinct and deliberate weapon of war, setting it apart from historical famines. The article cites explicit statements from Israeli officials at the war's outset about imposing a "complete siege" and argues that the resulting famine is entirely human-made, not the result of climate or market failures. Unlike other conflicts, Israel has systematically blocked established UN and NGO aid channels, creating unprecedented constraints on humanitarian relief. This sustained and methodical deprivation of food, in defiance of international aid capacity, is a key reason it is being prosecuted as a war crime.</p>
