          <p>Rescue operations are in their seventh day in Central Texas as teams search for more than 170 people still missing after catastrophic flash floods, with the death toll now at 121. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River rise to unprecedented levels, was particularly devastating in Kerr County, where a summer camp tragedy claimed the lives of at least 27 campers and counselors. A federal disaster has been declared, but scrutiny is growing over the adequacy of weather warnings and the impact of budget cuts on forecasting services.</p>

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified eight universally powerful words for campaign slogans after analyzing 20,000 messages from around the world. Words such as "people," "better," "change," and "together" act as "emotional shortcuts" that resonate across different cultures and political affiliations. The article explores this formula, contrasting it with specific, issue-based slogans and noting the increasing role of AI in crafting personalized political messages for individual voters.</p>

          <h2>Trainspotting Author Irvine Welsh Discusses New Novel and Criticizes Modern Digital Culture</h2>

          <p>Author Irvine Welsh, promoting his new novel "Men in Love," reflects on his career and expresses concern over the impact of modern technology on society. He argues that the internet and artificial intelligence have created a "post-culture society" where people have become "dumbed down machines" due to a lack of critical thought. Welsh contrasts this with the creative energy of the 1990s and discusses how the social decay that inspired his iconic novel "Trainspotting" has evolved into a new era of widespread economic precarity.</p>

          <p>The UK will begin returning some migrants who arrive in small boats to France within weeks under a new "one in, one out" pilot agreement. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, announced the plan, which involves the UK accepting a vetted asylum seeker from France for each person returned. The deal is intended to deter illegal Channel crossings by breaking the business model of people smugglers, though critics question its potential scale and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's announcement that there will be no release of a Jeffrey Epstein "client list" has caused shock and betrayal among many of the president's supporters. After years of promising a bombshell revelation, the FBI stated its review found no such list and it would not be releasing more files, prompting accusations of a cover-up from allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The reversal has splintered the movement, forcing conspiracy theories to mutate and turning ire toward administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>

          <p>President Trump is waiving executive privilege to compel former Biden administration aides to testify in a congressional investigation into the former president's health. This move forces aides to choose between revealing confidential discussions or facing contempt charges. The decision marks a stark reversal from Trump's first term, when he fought vigorously to use the same privilege to block his own aides from testifying to the January 6 committee, warning at the time that such waivers would do "grave damage" to the presidency.</p>
