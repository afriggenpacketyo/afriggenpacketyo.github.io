          <h2>Spain and Portugal Experience Widespread Power Outage</h2>

          <p>A major power outage struck Spain and Portugal, disrupting critical infrastructure like airports and trains. Nearly all power was restored to Spain within 18 hours, while Portugal faced a more gradual recovery due to its reliance on internal power production. The cause of the blackout remains unknown, with officials ruling out foul play at this stage, though the disruption affected tens of millions of people across the Iberian Peninsula, leading to widespread travel delays and impacting daily life. The incident underscores the vulnerability of interconnected power grids and the importance of robust infrastructure. This article is a New York Times Article.</p>

          <p>In a surprising turn of events, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative Party, lost his seat as the parliamentary representative for his Ottawa district. This defeat raises questions about his leadership of the party, as he has been a member of Parliament since 2004. The Liberal candidate, Bruce Fanjoy, won the race, marking a significant upset. Poilievre's campaign embraced rhetoric similar to that of Donald Trump, criticizing "radical woke ideology" and vowing to defund Canada's national broadcaster.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) stores experienced empty shelves and operational disruptions following a cyber attack, leading to the temporary pause of online orders. While contactless pay and Click & Collect issues have been resolved, online orders remain suspended, impacting a significant portion of M&S's clothing and household goods sales. Analysts predict the incident will negatively affect the retailer's profits as customers seek alternatives. M&S has not disclosed the nature of the cyber attack but stated they proactively took systems offline as part of managing the incident.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's Biomass satellite, designed to penetrate clouds and forest canopies, has been successfully launched to assess the carbon stored in the world's rainforests. This first-of-its-kind satellite will use radar technology to measure the woody material in trees, providing scientists with more accurate data for climate change models and deforestation tracking. The satellite, nicknamed "space brolly," will create annual maps showing carbon storage and loss, offering a consistent view of forests regardless of cloud cover. The project represents over 20 years of scientific effort to improve understanding of forests' role in climate regulation.</p>

          <p>Despite polling indicating general disapproval of President Trump's handling of the economy, tariffs, and stock market volatility, a majority of his 2024 voters remain confident in his economic leadership. While some express concerns about rising prices and the potential for a recession, they largely believe his policies will strengthen the U.S. economy in the long term. Trump voters appreciate his border crackdown but hold mixed views on LGBTQ issues and abortion, seeing him as a "rogue agent" who will do what he believes is necessary.</p>

This suggests a temporary hold on potential Hollywood curbs, although the US film industry faces declining revenues in China due to increasing preference for domestic films. The releases indicate that China is balancing trade war considerations with its own entertainment market needs, as Chinese audiences increasingly favor domestically made films that have rapidly closed the gap in terms of production quality.</p>

Although some polls show softened support due to economic concerns, a recent survey indicates Trump still commands strong backing from Republicans. While economists warn of potential price increases and a recession, Trump voters are willing to pay more for American-made goods and support his efforts to make America competitive again. The liberal media's negative portrayal of Trump's tariff battle contrasts with the views of many Trump voters who believe in his agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump is accused of using government powers to target perceived enemies, including political opponents, news organizations, and former officials. An NPR review found the administration is using criminal investigations, ICE detentions, contract bans, security clearance revocations, and firings to retaliate against those who have crossed him. Critics argue these actions represent an abuse of power and an assault on fundamental rights, while some allies defend them as ending the "weaponization" of law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that more Americans give President Trump a failing grade than any other grade for his first 100 days in office. The poll reveals declining approval ratings for Trump, driven by views on the economy, tariffs, and immigration. A majority of respondents disapprove of his handling of various aspects of the job, and many believe he is moving too fast and should obey court orders. The poll also shows declining favorability for Elon Musk, who is leading the administration's government-cutting efforts.</p>

The court will determine whether the family can sue the FBI for the harms caused by the raid, focusing on the interpretation of the Federal Tort Claims Act and the extent of government immunity.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win enough seats to form a government in Canada, although it is unclear if they will secure a majority. Both the Liberals and Conservatives have seen increased vote share compared to previous elections, largely at the expense of smaller parties. The NDP leader lost his seat, highlighting the shift in voter preferences. The Liberals are expected to win the most seats in key provinces, while the Conservatives are ahead in Alberta, reflecting regional divisions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's threats against Canada, both economic and existential, played a significant role in the Liberal party's victory in the Canadian election. Mark Carney, the Liberal leader, successfully positioned himself as an anti-Trump savior, capitalizing on concerns about Canada's economic survival. Despite the win, the Liberals secured a minority government, highlighting the divisions within the country. Carney now faces the challenge of helping Canada define itself on its own terms, independent of its relationship with the US.</p>

          <p>Dr. Victoria McCloud, the UK's only openly transgender judge, plans to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex at the European Court of Human Rights.

McCloud claims the Supreme Court failed to consider human rights arguments from transgender individuals, leading to a flawed outcome.

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley anticipate that the US and China will engage in negotiations and gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% by the end of the second quarter. More comprehensive talks in the second half of the year could lead to a further reduction in tariffs, bringing them down to 34% by year’s end. However, the damage already done to the economic cycle suggests that the overall direction of growth is expected to remain downward. Trade disruptions could be a gateway to negotiations, however, tariffs are unlikely to revert to levels seen before January 25.</p>
