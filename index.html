          <p>The Justice Department has initiated an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Congressional Republicans have accused Cuomo of lying to Congress during an investigation into coronavirus deaths in nursing homes, alleging he was involved in drafting and editing a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths but testified he was not involved. A spokesperson for Cuomo denies the allegations, calling the investigation "lawfare and election interference." The investigation follows criticism of the Justice Department's handling of criminal cases involving Democrats, including dropping charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.

          <p>A federal judge has cautioned that the U.S. government may be held in contempt of court for deporting migrants to South Sudan, potentially violating a previous order that ensures migrants have a meaningful opportunity to challenge their deportation.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants being transported to South Sudan, following concerns that their deportation may violate a court order. Judge Brian Murphy warned that officials could face criminal contempt if they violate the order, which ensures migrants have due process before being deported to countries where they might face danger. The order came after reports that migrants, including a Vietnamese man convicted of murder, were being flown to South Sudan. The judge indicated the Department of Homeland Security could comply by keeping the migrants on the plane or turning it around.</p>

          <p>Matthew Lee Johnson was executed in Texas for the burning death of Nancy Harris, whom he set on fire during a convenience store robbery in 2012. Johnson admitted to the crime at his trial and expressed remorse. His attorneys argued that his death sentence was unconstitutional and that his execution date was illegally scheduled. Harris, a great-grandmother, died several days after the attack, having described the suspect before her death.</p>
