          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for approximately nine hours over two days. Sources indicate she was granted a limited form of proffer immunity, allowing her to answer questions about roughly 100 individuals without her statements being used against her. While Maxwell's lawyer stated no deals have been made, he acknowledged she would welcome relief from her 20-year sentence. The meetings have drawn scrutiny, with President Trump stating he has not currently considered clemency for Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in five years due to disease. The disease was introduced by non-native animals brought to the region. In a rescue mission, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated, safer mountain range. A recent check confirmed the relocated herd is surviving and has produced new lambs, offering hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is releasing approximately $6.8 billion in federal K-12 education funds that had been previously frozen. The Department of Education stated the Office of Management and Budget completed its review of the funds, which will be dispersed to states starting next week. Education Secretary Linda McMahon addressed the delay at a National Governors Association meeting, attributing it to a thorough review process. The move follows a lawsuit from over 20 Democratic attorneys general who called the freeze unconstitutional. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former federal prosecutors have described the high-level meetings between Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell as unorthodox and concerning. Experts noted it is highly unusual for a deputy AG to personally conduct such an interview, a role typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge. Critics suggest the move appears politically motivated to address public pressure regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. They also raised concerns about Maxwell's credibility, as she is likely desperate for a reduced sentence.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Refugees International president Jeremy Konyndyk details how Gaza's population arrived at the edge of famine. He explains that after more than a year of severe food insecurity, the population's resilience is gone, making the current blockade catastrophic. Konyndyk criticizes the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid model as ineffective and dangerous, forcing people to risk their lives for poor-quality food. He argues that Israel is indisputably using starvation as a weapon of war and that the U.S. is complicit for tolerating the blockade and obstruction of aid.</p>

          <p>Unidentified gunmen have killed 14 people who were returning from a weekly market in the Bokkos region of central Nigeria. The attackers reportedly intercepted the vehicle and opened fire, with women and children among the victims. This area in Plateau state has experienced a rise in violent conflicts, often stemming from competition over land between farmers and herders. The attack has prompted calls from local leaders for increased security, as government presence in the rural area is sparse and armed gangs operate with frequency.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funds to states after abruptly freezing them earlier this month. The decision to withhold the congressionally approved funding, which supports programs like arts education and teacher training, had sparked widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback from lawmakers. The administration had initially claimed the freeze was to review "grossly misused" funds for a "radical left-wing agenda." Advocacy groups and superintendents have hailed the release of the critical funding for the upcoming school year. (not investment advice)</p>

Pro-recall activists claim they are protecting Taiwan's democracy from Beijing's influence, while the opposition alleges the DPP is trying to overturn election results.
