          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has requested approximately 20,000 National Guard troops to assist with mass deportation efforts, according to U.S. officials, representing an expansion of the Trump administration's use of the military for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department is reviewing the request, which aims to support law enforcement with logistics and operations related to immigration actions within the U.S. Currently, about 8,600 federal troops are already stationed at the border, and the Navy is providing intelligence flights and naval vessels for border support. DHS confirmed the request, stating it intends to use all available resources to remove criminal illegal aliens from the country. </p>

          <p>Thai authorities have issued arrest warrants for 17 individuals, including a prominent construction tycoon, following the collapse of a Bangkok skyscraper during an earthquake, which resulted in the deaths of numerous workers. The 30-story tower, intended to house the State Audit Office, collapsed during a 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck Thailand and neighboring Myanmar, leading to investigations into construction quality and building code violations. Those charged include executives and engineers from seven companies involved in the tower's design, construction, and supervision, and face potential life sentences if convicted. The authorities are still investigating the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman was fatally shot in the West Bank while en route to a hospital to give birth; however, doctors successfully delivered her baby via emergency cesarean section, though the infant remains in serious but stable condition. Hamas praised the attack as a "heroic act," but no group has claimed responsibility for the shooting, which occurred amid heightened violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israeli officials have condemned the incident as terrorism and are searching for the perpetrator, while Israeli forces killed at least five Palestinians in the West Bank on Thursday, according to both Israeli and Palestinian sources. The incident has sparked calls for retribution from far-right Israeli politicians.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a warning to California and Governor Gavin Newsom regarding a transgender athlete competing in a girls' track and field event, with the U.S. Department of Education criticizing the state's trans inclusion practices. The department highlighted concerns over a biologically male athlete participating in the girls' category and allegations that CIF officials forced athletes to remove "Protect Girls Sports" shirts. Some female athletes expressed concerns about fairness, while others blamed the CIF for enabling the situation. The CIF is already under federal Title IX investigation over the state's trans inclusion policies, and some California Christian schools have voiced opposition to the CIF's Gender Identity Policy.</p>

He accused the Trump administration of taking sadistic pleasure in inflicting pain on loyal American workers and rolling back historic civil rights legislation.

          <p>Scientific advisors to the CDC are debating whether to limit COVID vaccine recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems, mirroring practices in other countries, but new clinical testing requirements may delay vaccine availability. The HHS stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines, including those for seasonal strain changes, may require additional clinical evaluation, potentially affecting COVID and even flu shots. The FDA has requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of the vaccine for children under 12. Some experts fear these changes are part of a broader campaign to undermine vaccine use.</p>

Experts believe that China would aim to force Taiwan's capitulation through cyber-enabled economic warfare targeting the island's financial, energy, and telecommunications sectors. While the US does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state, it opposes any forceful takeover and remains committed to arming the island.

Researchers identified the document by comparing it to the other six known copies from 1300, using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging to confirm its authenticity. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace.

          <p>A mega-bill encompassing President Trump's legislative agenda is in jeopardy as several Republican hard-liners signaled their opposition to advancing the package out of the House Budget Committee. Concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt have led some Republicans to voice their intent to vote against it, potentially stalling its progress. Speaker Mike Johnson is working to unify his divided conference and address sticking points related to Medicaid and tax reform. The effort to pass the Trump-backed bill is a crucial test of Johnson's speakership as he seeks to secure support for the legislation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico has dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, marking a setback for Trump administration efforts to increase penalties for unlawful crossings. Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged with trespassing. The dismissals apply to immigrants who made initial court appearances on Thursday, though they still face charges for crossing the border illegally. The New Mexico national defense area was established in April, authorizing US army troops to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico.</p>

The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case related to Trump’s move to end birthright citizenship, with justices questioning the legality and consequences of the executive order.

The defense suggested that Combs may have been suffering from drug withdrawal during the period when the alleged sexual assault occurred. Text messages were presented to imply that Ventura initiated the idea of a "freak off" before the movie premiere, and the defense questioned whether bad drugs contributed to the alleged violence. Ventura stated that she had no idea whether the drugs they took were from a bad batch of MDMA.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly relying on officials to fill multiple positions, raising concerns about the capacity and potential conflicts of interest. High-ranking officials such as Todd Blanche, Russ Vought, and Kash Patel are holding multiple roles, while Marco Rubio is simultaneously serving as secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and acting national security advisor. This practice has drawn criticism for potentially weakening institutions and creating conflicts of interest, such as Rubio's role in preserving records related to his own actions as secretary of state. The administration's reliance on dual-hatted officials reflects challenges in finding qualified individuals and a preference for a small circle of trusted figures.</p>
