          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, reported first-quarter results that surpassed estimates and announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion. The bank's profit before tax was $9.48 billion, exceeding the expected $7.83 billion, while revenue reached $17.65 billion against an estimated $16.67 billion. Despite a year-on-year decline in profit and revenue, the bank experienced a substantial increase in profit compared to the previous quarter due to restructuring progress and cost-saving measures. The CEO expressed confidence in achieving targets amidst economic uncertainty, although potential headwinds from tariffs and recession concerns loom in subsequent quarters.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a surprising victory in the Canadian federal election, largely attributed to a backlash against Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies towards Canada. Trump's threats of annexation and tariffs became central issues, allowing Carney to position himself as a defender of Canadian sovereignty. While the Conservatives made gains, focusing on domestic issues, they ultimately fell short as the progressive vote coalesced around the Liberals. Carney plans to immediately negotiate a new economic and security relationship with the United States, distancing Canada from Trump's influence.</p>

The warning underscores the delicate balance ASEAN nations must maintain in navigating the economic and political tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A vigil for cats allegedly killed by a serial killer suspect in Santa Ana, California, turned violent when attendees targeted the wrong house. The mob believed the house belonged to the suspect's brother and demanded he come out, vandalizing the property and assaulting the resident. Police were slow to respond, and the crowd continued to accuse the residents of collaborating with the alleged cat murderer, despite the police declaring it an unlawful assembly. The victim stated that they were not related to the suspect, and were terrified by the crowd's actions.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved the TAKE IT DOWN Act, a bill supported by Melania Trump, which aims to impose strict penalties for publishing and promoting revenge porn. The act subjects offenders to prison time, fines, or both, for publishing "intimate visual depictions" without consent. Public forums must incorporate a way for subjects of revenge porn to request its removal, with platforms required to scrub the content within 48 hours. Melania Trump emphasized the bill's importance in protecting the dignity, privacy, and safety of children, building on her "BE BEST" initiative.</p>

          <p>Approximately 55,000 L.A. County workers went on strike, leading to disruptions in public services, including healthcare, social work, libraries, and parks. The two-day strike was prompted by alleged labor law violations and a dispute over contract negotiations. Union leaders cited retaliation and contracting out work as key issues, along with dissatisfaction over the county's initial pay offer. The county cited wildfire costs, a sex abuse settlement, and the loss of federal grants as reasons for financial constraints, while emphasizing the need to protect its credit rating.</p>

          <p>As part of President Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, unaccompanied minors are now being targeted for deportation, with the Department of Homeland Security conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the US alone. These actions have sparked fears of a crackdown and concerns about potential "backdoor family separation." The president has also signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that obstruct federal immigration laws. These moves reflect a broader effort to enforce stricter immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied in Brooklyn to condemn the verbal and physical assault of a woman by pro-Israel counterprotesters. The woman was attacked after wandering onto the scene of protests triggered by a far-right Israeli official's appearance. Police were present to maintain order and prevent the group from reaching its intended destination, the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters. Organizers cited two other assaults that had happened at the Crown Heights protest, and the mayor said a second woman had been separated from other pro-Palestinian protesters and harassed by counterprotesters, and injured.</p>

          <p>A research team predicts that without significant action on global warming, students in Japan may be unable to participate in extracurricular outdoor sports during the summer months by the 2060s. Heat stress projections indicate that outdoor sporting activity would need to be avoided during certain hours in July and August in most parts of Japan, excluding Hokkaido. The projections are based on weather data and heat stress measurements in 842 cities across Japan, highlighting the potential impact of climate change on daily life and the need for adaptation strategies.</p>

This case is the first announced by the Justice Department in which Mr. Musk’s unit, also known as DOGE, is credited with aiding in the investigation that led to the charge.</p>

          <p>A Pittsburgh funeral home director, Patrick Vereb, is facing charges for allegedly throwing out the bodies of thousands of pets and providing owners with the ashes of other animals. Vereb is accused of stealing over $650,000 from more than 6,500 customers who paid for pet burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024. Instead of performing the promised services, investigators say Vereb disposed of many pets at a landfill and provided customers with the remains of unknown animals. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office is urging potential victims to come forward.</p>
