          <p>Several prominent banks, including the American Bankers Association and Nomura, express strong support for President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," anticipating a significant boost to the U.S. economy. They highlight the bill's sweeping tax reforms and targeted incentives as crucial for averting a sharp fiscal contraction and encouraging corporate investment, especially as many provisions from the 2017 tax bill are set to expire by the end of 2025. While credit agencies and critics warn the bill could add at least $3 trillion to the federal deficit, proponents believe it offers much-needed tax relief and an economic tailwind. Citi strategists also project the bill, alongside new trade deals, will improve overall growth sentiment in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philip Lane, the European Central Bank's chief economist, has stated that the institution's recent period of monetary tightening is "done," successfully bringing inflation down from a peak of 10% to its 2% target. Speaking at the ECB's annual forum in Sintra, Portugal, Lane emphasized the central bank's commitment to remaining data-dependent while assuring that it would not overreact to isolated "blips" in future inflation figures. The euro zone's inflation rate for May came in at 1.9%, just below the central bank's 2% target, and its key interest rate has been cut to 2%, with money market pricing suggesting expectations for a further quarter-point trim by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how recent perceived victories, including a risky military action against Iran's nuclear sites, favorable Supreme Court rulings, and successful trade negotiations with Canada, have emboldened former President Donald Trump. It highlights his increasingly aggressive tactics, such as publicly demanding the cancellation of Bibi Netanyahu's criminal trial in Israel and effectively pressuring a Republican senator to not seek reelection. The piece suggests Trump's approach thrives on controversy and that he is determined to use expanded executive powers against opponents and detractors. His actions demonstrate a pattern of swift, impactful moves that often yield immediate results, further solidifying his political dominance.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciencesâ€™ Aerospace Information Research Institute have developed an optimized model utilizing satellite data to precisely monitor carbon dioxide emissions from coal power plants. This significant breakthrough offers a standardized method for global carbon accounting, a crucial element currently lacking in international efforts. The study demonstrates the substantial potential for satellite remote sensing technology in accurately estimating CO2 emissions, enabling retrospective analysis of historical data to detect anomalous emission events. This innovative framework could also be effectively applied to monitor emissions from other major industrial sources, such as oil and gas fields or steel plants, contributing to more robust environmental oversight.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board has issued a stark warning that former President Donald Trump's recent actions, particularly his attacks on Senator Thom Tillis over the "Big Beautiful Bill," could jeopardize his presidency. The article suggests Trump has an "uncanny habit of handing his opponents a sword" when political events are otherwise favorable. Tillis's subsequent decision not to seek reelection creates a potential pickup opportunity for Democrats in 2026, which the Journal concludes could halt Republican legislative reforms and future Supreme Court nominations if Democrats gain control of both the House and Senate. This analysis highlights a pattern of self-sabotage in Trump's political strategy.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who faces mounting pressure to resign after a leaked phone conversation with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen. In the clip, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen "uncle" and criticized a Thai military commander, sparking public anger and a petition for her dismissal, which the court is now considering. This development makes her the third politician from the influential Shinawatra clan to lose power before completing a term, further destabilizing her ruling coalition which already holds a slim majority. The court's decision, reached by a 7-2 vote, requires her to present a defense within 15 days, with Deputy PM Suriya Jungrungruangkit serving as acting leader in the interim.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is undergoing a marathon "vote-a-rama" on President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," a massive tax and spending package that Republicans aim to pass by a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The legislation, which includes increased spending for border security, defense, and energy production, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Democrats are using the amendment process to put GOP colleagues on record regarding controversial provisions, while some Republicans, like Sen. Thom Tillis, oppose the bill due to concerns over Medicaid cuts. The White House is exerting intense pressure on GOP lawmakers for its passage.</p>

          <p>Iowa has become the first U.S. state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, meaning transgender and nonbinary residents are no longer protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and other aspects of life. The new law explicitly defines female and male based on reproductive organs at birth and eliminates the ability to change sex designation on birth certificates. Additionally, provisions in the state's health and human services budget state that Medicaid recipients are no longer covered for gender-affirming surgery or hormone therapy. This unprecedented rollback of legal rights, which took effect Tuesday, has drawn protests and is feared by advocates to lead to increased discrimination and compel some families to consider moving out of state.</p>

While drawing protests over its potential environmental impact on a delicate ecosystem and criticism for its perceived cruelty, the administration views its inhospitable locationâ€”filled with mosquitoes, pythons, and alligatorsâ€”as a key deterrent to escape.

The city has become an epicenter of daily violence, with bodies scattered, bullet-ridden homes, and businesses closing, despite authorities' efforts.

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," threatening to support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for the massive tax and domestic policy package. Musk, who previously spent significantly to elect Republicans, stated that lawmakers who campaigned on reducing spending but backed this bill "should hang their head in shame" and "will lose their primary." This renewed opposition, which includes a suggestion for a "new political party" called the "America Party," has reignited a public feud with Trump. The President retaliated by highlighting the federal subsidies benefiting Musk's electric car and rocket businesses, suggesting Musk's success is tied to government aid.</p>

          <p>California's fire season has begun with a rapid escalation, as more than a dozen wildfires have ignited across the state in just 72 hours, primarily in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Officials warn these events are a precursor to a hot summer and fall, following an unusually dry winter and spring. Major blazes include the fast-growing Wolf fire, which erupted Sunday afternoon and quickly grew to over 2,400 acres near Banning, and the Juniper fire, prompting evacuations in Perris. Fire crews are actively working to establish containment on these and other fires, with red flag warnings also in effect for parts of Northern California, underscoring the immediate and ongoing threat to communities.</p>

          <p>More than 130 charities and NGOs, including Oxfam and Save the Children, are demanding the closure of the controversial Israeli and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), citing over 500 Palestinian deaths among aid seekers since its inception in late May. The organizations allege that Israeli forces and armed groups "routinely" fire on Palestinians seeking aid, violating humanitarian norms. They argue the GHF system, which replaced 400 aid distribution points with just four military-controlled sites, forces two million people into dangerous, overcrowded zones. The UN Secretary-General has also condemned the GHF as "inherently unsafe," amidst severe hunger and famine-like conditions, emphasizing that it is not a viable humanitarian response for Gazans.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complex question of how much money individuals need to save for retirement, emphasizing that the answer varies greatly depending on personal aspirations and desired lifestyles. It highlights challenges in setting national pension policies due to these diverse retirement goals, a problem the government is grappling with in its Pension Review. The Hargreaves Lansdown Savings and Resilience Barometer analyzed various measures of adequacy, including "pounds and pence" benchmarks like the Living Pension, and "relative measures" such as target replacement rates based on pre-retirement earnings. The research found that relying solely on fixed "pounds and pence" targets might mislead both lower and higher earners regarding their actual retirement preparedness. (not investment advice)</p>

This trust had funded influential research into inequality for 16 years, but was suddenly shut down, with its CEO and trustees sacked. Toynbee suggests this move, which Aberdeen denies is linked to political pressures against ESG and DEI initiatives, is a symptom of "darkening business attitudes" where "doing good is not fashionable." The decision leaves Â£3.6m in promised grants in limbo, impacting crucial social research organizations focused on financial security for lower incomes, and is seen as a "shoddy" and "ungracious" act by its former chair.</p>

It highlights the profound impact of finally seeing French-set stories, such as Simon MoutaÃ¯rou's "No Chains No Masters," which focuses on the marronage of enslaved people, and Jean-Claude Barny's biopic "Fanon," about the Martinican psychiatrist Frantz Fanon. The article argues that despite a rich history of colonial oppression and its ongoing effects in former colonies, these compelling narratives remain largely marginalized in mainstream French public space. However, it notes that new films like "Zion" are gaining public success, indicating audiences are ready to confront this history, despite the cinema industry's slowness.</p>

The Wall Street investment bank forecasts the yuan to break the 7 per dollar level in six months and 6.9 in 12 months, reflecting fading confidence in U.S. economic exceptionalism, loose fiscal policies, and rising long-term financing costs.

LeMan, however, denies the cartoon refers to the Prophet, stating it aimed to portray the righteousness of oppressed Muslims killed by Israel and never intended to insult religious values. The magazine apologized to "well-intentioned readers who feel hurt" but defended its work, rejecting allegations of insult.

The expansion was largely supported by increased production due to "better trade conditions and promotional activities," despite new export orders declining for a third month.

          <p>A U-Haul van found in a California Taco Bell parking lot contained 134 cats, many in distress and about one-fifth deceased, leading to the arrest of a 69-year-old Long Beach woman on 93 counts of animal cruelty. Disturbing images showed cats pressed against the windshield and squeezed into cardboard boxes, with no food or water inside the vehicle. The animals, ranging from one week to eight years old, were emaciated and are now receiving treatment at the Merced County Animal Services shelter, where they will eventually be available for adoption. The incident occurred on a 100-degree day, prompting officials to warn against the severe dangers of leaving any animal in a hot car.</p>

          <p>Beijing has sanctioned former Philippine lawmaker Francis Tolentino, barring him from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, citing his "egregious conduct on China-related issues." Tolentino was a principal author of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, legislation that asserts Manilaâ€™s claims in the South China Sea and has been strongly opposed by Beijing. He also led a Senate investigation into alleged Chinese espionage activities within the Philippines. China's foreign ministry stated its unwavering determination to defend its national sovereignty, security, and development interests, underscoring that individual "anti-China politicians" undermine bilateral relations. This action signals increased diplomatic tensions between the two nations over maritime disputes.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Newsom Secures Major Housing Reform Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 22:42:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through "transformative" housing legislation, significantly reforming the state's environmental review standards to accelerate construction. The new laws, Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, exempt most urban housing projects and several nonresidential facilities from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a process often causing years of delays and litigation. Newsom employed a "poison pill" provision in the state budget to ensure the bills' passage, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions. Experts believe these reforms could be the most significant to CEQA in its 55-year history, immediately impacting development and allowing numerous projects to proceed.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Donald Trump, agreeing to rescind a digital services tax on major U.S. technology firms. Trump had called the proposed 3% charge on Canadian revenue for companies like Amazon and Google a "blatant attack," threatening tariffs and calling off trade talks. Canada's Finance Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne confirmed the tax would be scrapped as part of a "bigger negotiation," leading to resumed trade talks between Washington and Ottawa. The White House hailed this as a "big victory" for U.S. tech companies and workers, while Canada's opposition criticized the "11th hour" concession and urged gains in other trade areas.</p>

          <p>A military commander has proposed shifting some of the California National Guard troops, currently deployed in Los Angeles by the Trump administration to deal with protests, to wildfire duty. General Gregory Guillot requested Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth move 200 of the approximately 4,000 Guard members to help prepare for California's "early and active" wildfire season, which the state expects to be above average. This deployment has been controversial, with California Governor Gavin Newsom previously objecting to the federalization of Guard forces, arguing it could interfere with crucial wildfire response efforts. The potential redirection highlights the competing demands on military resources amid various state and federal priorities and the state's need for more firefighting capacity.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, will remain in federal custody until at least mid-July. His lawyers requested the delay, citing conflicting statements from the Trump administration regarding his potential deportation to a third country after his release from Justice Department custody. Abrego Garcia had been granted legal status in 2019, which should have prevented his removal due to likely persecution by gangs. This case highlights the complexities and controversies surrounding U.S. immigration policies and the legal challenges faced by individuals caught between different governmental jurisdictions and promises.</p>
