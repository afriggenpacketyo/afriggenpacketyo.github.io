          <p>The Democratic nomination of Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor signals a significant ideological shift, particularly within the city's large Jewish community. Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel's government, secured the nomination despite his controversial stances, indicating that such views are no longer a disqualifier for many progressive Democratic voters. While his success has alarmed some who fear waning political influence and rising antisemitism, it also reflects a growing number of Jewish voters who are critical of Israeli policy in Gaza.</p>

          <p>With temperatures rising, animal welfare charities are reminding dog owners of the severe dangers of exercising their pets in hot weather. Dogs are highly susceptible to heat-related illness as they cannot sweat effectively and can overheat quickly, which can be fatal. Experts advise checking pavement temperature, carrying water, and avoiding walks during the hottest parts of the day, suggesting that keeping dogs cool indoors is the safest option during a heatwave.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment program in "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent US military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, which Grossi described as causing severe but not total damage. He emphasized that Iran retains the industrial capacity and technical knowledge to rebuild, suggesting that a diplomatic solution is essential as military action alone cannot eliminate the country's nuclear potential.</p>
