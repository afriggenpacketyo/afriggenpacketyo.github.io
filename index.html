          <p>England rugby star Megan Jones, widely regarded as a top player at the current World Cup, has channeled profound personal grief into her stellar performance. Having lost both her father and mother within four months, she describes rugby as her "safe haven" and her fearlessness on the pitch as born from bitter perspective. Jones, who once worked as an Amazon delivery driver during a career freeze, has also become a patron for a charity supporting addiction recovery, inspired by her mother's struggles. Her journey exemplifies resilience, culminating in a nomination for world player of the year, demonstrating her strength amidst personal tragedy.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered nearly £500 million lost to fraud over the past year, largely attributed to a new artificial intelligence tool called the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator. Over a third of the recovered funds related to Covid-19 pandemic fraud, with other gains from unlawful council tax claims and illegal social housing subletting. The Cabinet Office, which developed the tool, announced plans to license it internationally to countries like the US and Australia. While civil liberties campaigners have previously criticized government AI use for potential bias, ministers emphasize the tool's role in protecting public funds and making policies "fraud-proof" before implementation.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman unveiled an ambitious $850 billion infrastructure expansion, partnering with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, to build 17 gigawatts of data centers across the US. This unprecedented investment, nearly half of the projected $2 trillion global AI infrastructure surge, is driven by a tenfold increase in ChatGPT usage over 18 months. Altman acknowledges public concerns about the scale but asserts it's essential for maximizing AI capabilities, highlighting electricity as the biggest bottleneck. Critics warn of a potential bubble and circular financing, but Altman remains confident in AI's long-term value to society, suggesting cycles of over and under-investment are normal for technological revolutions.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a dominant performance in his final regular-season pitching start, shutting out the Arizona Diamondbacks over six innings with an elite fastball, showcasing his readiness for the postseason. This outing marked a significant milestone in his recovery from a second Tommy John surgery, with Ohtani completing a season-high 91 pitches and finishing with a 2.87 ERA. Despite his stellar pitching, the Dodgers ultimately lost 5-4 in a walk-off, as their bullpen squandered a 4-0 lead in the seventh and ninth innings. Manager Dave Roberts is now strategizing Ohtani's crucial role in the upcoming wild-card round, carefully considering his two-way workload and the team's other pitching options for optimal postseason success.</p>

He thanked supporters, including conservatives like Ted Cruz, who defended his right to free speech, while criticizing President Trump's attempts to silence him and affiliate stations that continued to preempt his show.

          <p>A South Korean court has sentenced Park Soon-kwan, CEO of lithium battery maker Aricell, to 15 years in prison following a deadly fire in June 2024 that killed 23 people, including 18 foreign workers. The court deemed the blaze an "anticipated disaster," finding that Park and other executives caused the deaths due to inadequate safety measures and insufficient worker training. This marks the longest jail term imposed under the country's industrial safety law, which punishes owners for fatal incidents. The ruling underscores a national push by President Lee Jae Myung to increase penalties against businesses where fatal workplace accidents occur, aiming for greater accountability and worker protection.</p>

          <p>Datong, a city in China's Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during severe northern China floods this summer, despite almost 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. This resilience is attributed to former mayor Geng Yanbo's foresight, who spearheaded a project over 15 years ago to widen the city's main waterway and reinforce its banks. Initially met with skepticism and relocation efforts, the project's crucial value is now recognized. Experts, like Su Yue of the Economist Intelligence Unit, highlight such infrastructure investments not only improve urban resilience but also stimulate the economy, citing Beijing's additional 1 trillion yuan in sovereign debt for disaster prevention.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in his position on the war in Ukraine, stating that Kyiv could "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with European and NATO support. This declaration, made on Truth Social after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, contrasts with Trump's previous suggestions of territorial concessions. Trump cited Russia's "BIG Economic trouble" as a key factor, calling them a "paper tiger." Zelenskyy welcomed the "big shift," expressing surprise but taking it as a positive signal that the US would support Ukraine until the war's end. The article notes Trump's unpredictable foreign policy, but this marks a more assertive stance on Ukraine's potential victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several US citizens and a green card holder have filed legal claims against the US government, alleging wrongful detention and racial profiling by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration's intensified enforcement agenda. Cary Lopez Alvarado, a 23-year-old US citizen, recounted being handcuffed and detained for eight hours with a chain around her belly while pregnant, giving birth shortly after her release with cuts and bruises. Juan Rivas, a green card holder, claims he was beaten despite having legal documents. Lawyers warn that a recent Supreme Court decision could put more citizens at risk, advising clients to carry identification to prevent such incidents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has been ordered to repay nearly £5 million after falsely claiming it met safe maternity care standards to receive funds from the Maternity Incentive Scheme. An investigation by NHS Resolution found the trust had not met the required safety measures, including listening to patients and properly investigating deaths. This follows a damning Care Quality Commission report rating their maternity services as inadequate and exposing women and babies to "significant risk." Families who experienced poor care are now demanding a full independent inquiry, highlighting systemic flaws in self-assessment within the NHS incentive scheme and the need for greater accountability.</p>

          <p>Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old Mexican national and former DACA recipient, has died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after being hospitalized, marking the 14th detainee death since January. His death comes as Democratic senators raise concerns about the increasing number of fatalities in ICE custody and alleged human rights violations at detention centers. Reports from facilities like Adelanto Detention Center detail inadequate medical care, restrictive segregation, and unsanitary conditions, especially with rising detainee numbers. ICE stated it provides comprehensive medical care, but the incident highlights ongoing scrutiny and calls for improved oversight of immigration detention facilities.</p>

          <p>The US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its recall of frozen shrimp products for the sixth time in over a month due to possible contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. Seattle-based AquaStar is recalling three types of shrimp sold across 31 states, including Kroger and AquaStar branded products, due to unsanitary preparation or packaging conditions. The investigation began when US Customs and Border Protection detected Cesium-137 in an imported shipment from Indonesia. While no illnesses have been reported, experts note such frequent recalls for radioactive contamination are unusual, suggesting possible causes like contaminated food sources or irradiator use, underscoring ongoing food safety concerns.</p>

Beyond international affairs, domestic news focused on a "bombshell" leaked email concerning Sir Keir Starmer's Chief of Staff, Morgan McSweeney, prompting calls for an investigation into political donations. The death of cricket umpire Dickie Bird at 92 was also widely reported, with papers celebrating him as a "national treasure" and a beloved, eccentric sporting figure.</p>

          <p>China's successive five-year plans have been instrumental in shaping its economic trajectory, transforming a limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory" since 1953. Despite moving away from a command economy, these 14 plans have remained a cornerstone of macroeconomic policymaking. The article highlights key milestones, such as the first plan's focus on heavy industry, illustrating the country's long and complex economic history. As Beijing now aims to ascend the value chain and become a global innovation hub, the upcoming 15th five-year plan is anticipated to be crucial in guiding this transition, reflecting a continuous strategic approach to national development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International health organizations and experts have strongly rejected President Trump's assertion that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of autism in children. The European Medicines Agency, UK's MHRA, and Australian health authorities all affirmed that current scientific evidence shows no causal link and that paracetamol remains safe for pregnant women. Spain's Minister of Health criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, drawing parallels to his past controversial health remarks. This collective scientific pushback underscores the consensus that robust studies do not support a connection between prenatal acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, reaffirming its safety for managing pain and fever during pregnancy.</p>
