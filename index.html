          <p>A terror attack in Manchester resulted in two fatalities and three serious injuries when a man drove a vehicle into a crowd and began stabbing people outside a synagogue. The incident occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, prompting widespread condemnation from political and royal figures. Police shot the suspect, who is believed to be deceased, and are investigating suspicious items on his person, leading to the deployment of a bomb disposal unit. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ordered increased police presence at synagogues nationwide to ensure the safety of the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>Eyewitnesses to the attack outside a Manchester synagogue have described a chaotic and terrifying scene, initially mistaking the incident for a car crash. One witness recounted seeing a man with a knife attempting to break into the synagogue building after the vehicle attack. According to accounts, police arrived within seconds, issued warnings to the armed assailant, and then opened fire when he did not comply. The attack, which left two dead and three injured, has deeply traumatized local residents in what is described as a quiet community.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical unit of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash transaction. This deal represents Berkshire's most significant acquisition since 2022 and utilizes a portion of its substantial cash reserves, which total nearly $344 billion. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub stated the proceeds will primarily be used for debt reduction, a move that will enable the company to resume its stock buyback program. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter, strengthening Berkshire's portfolio in the chemical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Invita Café in Rancho Santa Fe, California, reported a significant increase in sales after facing backlash for honoring the late Turning Point USA founder, Charlie Kirk. The owner, Sara De Luca, placed stickers on coffee cups in his memory, which led to a flood of negative online reviews and phone calls. However, she stated that the community and her church rallied in support, resulting in a 312% surge in sales and long lines of supportive customers. De Luca noted that the overwhelming response was positive, with people from across the country contributing to her business.</p>

          <p>A new report from wealth intelligence firm Altrata forecasts a major generational shift among the world's ultra-wealthy, defined as those with a net worth of at least $30 million. By 2040, millennials and Gen Z are expected to represent over a third of this demographic, largely due to the "Great Wealth Transfer" from baby boomers. This transition has significant implications for industries catering to the rich, as younger generations show different preferences, with stronger interests in technology and hospitality over traditional finance.

          <p>OpenAI has introduced parental controls for ChatGPT and launched a new AI video app, Sora, amid growing concerns about the impact of AI on young users. Despite these new safety features, some experts argue the company is not addressing the core issue of children forming emotional dependencies on AI companions. Critics point out that the onus of safety is placed on parents, who often do not use such controls, rather than on tech companies to build inherent safeguards. The development raises questions about whether the tech industry is repeating past mistakes made with social media's impact on youth mental health.</p>

These issues, combined with an aging fanbase and difficulty for younger supporters to access tickets, have raised concerns about the matchday atmosphere at Stamford Bridge.

As a result, teams are required to fit their cars with a cooling vest system, although drivers are not mandated to wear them. The move was prompted by incidents at the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix, where extreme conditions left several drivers on the verge of collapse.</p>

Economic growth forecasts have been revised downward to 1.3% for 2026, a sharp drop from previous years.

Firefighters were dispatched at least 35 times for electrical problems before the larger fire began.

The State Department had sought an original sword as a gift for the monarch during President Trump's state visit to the U.K. Ultimately, a replica was provided by West Point, but the disagreement appears to have led to Arrington's departure from his post.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine proposes that the observed surge in cancer cases among adults under 50 might be partially an "epidemic of diagnosis" rather than a true epidemic of disease. Researchers found that while diagnoses have nearly doubled since 1990, the rate of metastatic cancers and the overall death rate have remained flat. This suggests that improved screening technologies are detecting more cancers that may never have become clinically significant. While the findings offer a nuanced perspective, experts caution against dismissing the genuine increase in certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, among younger adults.</p>

Despite their functional flaws, "bad" shapes persist in the market, likely due to nostalgia and their frequent use in dishes like pasta salads at potlucks.

The case raises fundamental questions about the extent to which states can regulate professional advice to prevent harm, especially when the practice is opposed by every major medical and mental health organization. The outcome could have significant implications for LGBTQ rights and professional conduct standards nationwide.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for Storm Amy, the first named storm of the season, which is expected to bring severe conditions to the country on Friday and Saturday. The warning is in place for western and northern Scotland, where wind gusts could reach up to 95 mph. Widespread gales and heavy rain are predicted, creating a risk of flooding, landslides, and significant transport disruption. Forecasters warn that damage is possible, as trees still in full leaf are more susceptible to being toppled by the strong winds.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-backed media has derided a recent meeting where President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed top U.S. military commanders. Outlets like Kankan News characterized the event not as a strategic session but as a "public loyalty pledge" and a "MAGA loyalty test." The commentary mocked the necessity of flying commanders from around the world to hear speeches about masculinity and political agendas. The meeting featured Trump outlining plans to reshape the military to align with his preferences and Hegseth telling officers to resign if they did not support his agenda.</p>

          <p>Airlines worldwide are grappling with a significant pilot shortage, driven by a wave of early retirements during the COVID-19 pandemic and a backlog in training new pilots. As air travel demand surges, companies are struggling to fill cockpits, leading them to increase pay, offer large bonuses, and recruit from noncommercial sectors. The high cost of flight training, which can exceed $100,000 in the U.S., remains a major barrier for aspiring pilots. Experts predict the situation will take several years to normalize, with some sources estimating a need for over 600,000 new commercial pilots globally by 2044.</p>

          <p>Rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered a powerful performance in the Dodgers' National League wild-card series, solidifying his case as the team's new closer. In a perfect final inning, the 23-year-old from Japan threw six of seven fastballs faster than 100 mph and struck out two batters with a devastating forkball. After the team's bullpen struggled in previous games, Sasaki's dominant outing provided a clear solution for the crucial late-inning role. While team management remains officially noncommittal, his performance has created a strong consensus that he is the answer to the team's bullpen concerns heading into the rest of the postseason.</p>

          <p>The government shutdown is largely centered on a Democratic demand to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. These subsidies, expanded during the pandemic, have made healthcare plans significantly more affordable or even free for millions of lower- and middle-income Americans. If they expire, premiums are expected to soar, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. Republicans have mischaracterized the subsidies and argued the debate should be postponed, a move critics see as a cynical ploy to weaken the ACA and strip Democrats of their negotiating leverage.</p>

          <p>Nonprofits in Los Angeles are reporting that a new "real-time" system from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) for tracking shelter bed availability is frequently inaccurate. This flawed data creates a misleading public perception of high vacancy rates and hinders efforts to place unhoused people, as outreach workers may send individuals to shelters that are actually full. For example, one shelter was listed as nearly empty when it was 95% occupied. LAHSA has acknowledged "growing pains" with the new system, which was intended to streamline the placement process but is currently causing frustration among service providers.</p>
