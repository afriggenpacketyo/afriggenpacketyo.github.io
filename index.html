          <p>Japanese golfer Miyu Yamashita, 24, has won her first major championship at the Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl, finishing two shots ahead of England's Charley Hull. Yamashita demonstrated remarkable composure, carding a two-under-par 70 in the final round to maintain the lead she established on Friday. Despite relentless pressure from Hull, who finished second in a major for the fourth time, Yamashita's consistent play secured the victory. This win makes her the third Japanese player to claim the Women's Open title.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway for a 45-year-old former U.S. Army soldier suspected of killing four people at a tavern in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities have identified the victims as the bartender and three patrons, all of whom were likely known to the suspect who lived next door. Law enforcement agencies have released the suspect's name, Michael Paul Brown, and are offering a reward for information leading to his capture. The suspect is considered armed and dangerous, and a motive for the heinous crime is still under investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with payouts expected to be less than £950 per deal. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, deemed exceptionally large commissions as unfair. The FCA will consult on the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and is estimated to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The first payouts under the proposed plan are anticipated to begin next year. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking on CBS's "Meet the Press," Greer indicated that the August 12 tariff deadline could potentially be moved as talks continue at various governmental levels. He also defended the president's ability to use economic actions, like tariffs, for geopolitical reasons, citing the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. This context arose when questioned about linking a potential U.S.-Canada trade deal to Canada's stance on Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion, with England needing just 35 more runs and India requiring four wickets to secure victory. A tense fourth day at The Oval saw England reach 339-6 in a record-breaking pursuit of 374 before rain and poor light stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late comeback from India's bowlers, who took three quick wickets, left the match on a knife-edge. The entire series now hinges on the final morning's play.</p>

          <p>Trump administration officials are defending the controversial firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weaker-than-expected jobs report. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited significant downward revisions to previous months' data as a reason for the dismissal, stating the president wants reliable numbers. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists, including a former Trump-appointed BLS commissioner, who warn it undermines the credibility of vital government data. Critics like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called the action "scary stuff" reminiscent of authoritarian tactics.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz outlined the Trump administration's plans for Medicaid, emphasizing a $200 billion investment to support the program.

This development comes as the United States is set to impose a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other products, effective August 6. The new Chinese permits are valid for five years and represent a strategic pivot for Brazil, which is the top supplier of coffee to the U.S. While China is a smaller market for Brazilian coffee currently, this approval signals a potential shift in global trade dynamics for the commodity.</p>

          <p>Soccer superstar Lionel Messi left Inter Miami's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes due to an apparent hamstring injury. The 38-year-old went down after a challenge and, after being attended to by trainers, walked directly to the locker room. Coach Javier Mascherano stated that Messi felt a pull and will undergo tests to determine the severity of the injury, putting his availability for the team's next match in jeopardy. The incident highlights the ongoing challenge of managing Messi's workload amid a packed schedule, as he has dealt with several leg injuries in recent seasons.</p>

          <h2>Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Downplays Micah Parsons' Public Trade Request</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' public trade request as "negotiation talk" and does not intend to trade him. The standoff stems from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in NFL history. Jones insisted the situation is a normal part of the negotiation process, similar to past disputes with other star players. Despite the public friction, Parsons remains at training camp, and several teammates have publicly voiced their support for him.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has provoked widespread condemnation by visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing "status quo" agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, but not to pray there. Jordan, the site's custodian, called the visit an "unacceptable provocation," while Palestinian leaders described it as crossing red lines. The Israeli prime minister's office stated there has been no change in policy, despite video evidence of Ben-Gvir's prayers.</p>

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney's Republican voter registration in Florida has been revealed amid public discourse over her new ad campaign for American Eagle. Public records show the 27-year-old star registered as a Republican in June 2024. The revelation has added a new layer to the controversy surrounding her "great genes/jeans" ad campaign, which some critics have called tone-deaf for echoing eugenics-related rhetoric. Meanwhile, many conservatives have praised the campaign, and American Eagle's stock has reportedly risen, with the company defending the ads as being solely about the jeans.</p>

          <p>China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system. Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed what looked like a successful launch, a critical milestone for the vessel before it officially enters service. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which allows for the deployment of heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump ramps on its older carriers. This development marks a significant step forward in China's naval modernization and power projection capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new report has identified the top U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential, with mid-sized metro areas like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin dominating the list. The study, conducted by HR technology company Checkr, ranked the 100 largest cities based on factors like unemployment rate, labor force growth, and real per capita income. The findings suggest a shift in the geography of opportunity away from traditional coastal hubs like New York and Los Angeles, which did not make the top 10. Affordability and a strong business climate are key drivers for the success of these emerging cities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is accelerating plans to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical treatment in the UK, with the scheme expected to be operational within weeks. This move follows criticism from the Foreign Affairs Committee about the government's previous reluctance to support such an initiative. While the exact number is unconfirmed, reports suggest up to 300 children could be brought over, accompanied by a guardian, for free medical care. The plan is being developed as humanitarian organizations continue to warn of a worsening health crisis in Gaza.</p>
