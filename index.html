          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot at Utah Valley University during an outdoor debate, an event officials have described as a "targeted attack." Following a massive manhunt, authorities arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who is now facing charges including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm. The investigation revealed Robinson was not a student at the university and had become increasingly political, with messages referencing the weapon found at the scene. His father ultimately encouraged him to surrender, leading to his capture, as the community and the nation grapple with the implications of this high-profile political assassination.</p>

          <p>Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil recently disclosed that he suffered a severe stroke last Christmas, which initially left his entire left side paralyzed and prompted doctors to doubt his future mobility. This significant health scare led to the postponement of the band's Las Vegas residency, allowing Neil to focus intensely on physical therapy at his Nashville home. He detailed a challenging recovery, progressing from needing full assistance to using mobility aids, ultimately regaining his ability to walk and perform. Neil has since made a triumphant return to the stage, demonstrating remarkable resilience and dedication to his career despite the severe medical challenge, and is performing at nearly full capacity.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 people participated in a "Unite the Kingdom" march in central London, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, while a smaller counter-protest by anti-racism campaigners also took place nearby. The event, which featured a videolink appearance by Elon Musk, saw Metropolitan Police officers facing "unacceptable violence," with bottles, flares, and other projectiles thrown, leading to nine arrests. Police deployed 1,000 officers and used barriers to separate the two groups, underscoring the tense atmosphere and potential for conflict surrounding the demonstration. Robinson criticized politicians and discussed migrant rights, while counter-protesters advocated for refugees and condemned racism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Fox News that National Guard troops would be deployed to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of his ongoing crackdown on crime in Democrat-led cities. Memphis Mayor Paul Young expressed his strong displeasure, stating he was not happy with the decision and only learned of it through Trump's television interview. Despite the city's high crime rate, Young believes that financial resources for intervention and prevention, along with additional patrol officers, are more effective than military deployment. The mayor also voiced significant concerns about invoking images reminiscent of the 1968 National Guard presence after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, highlighting historical sensitivities.</p>

          <p>The Taliban regime's top diplomat, Amir Khan Muttaqi, reportedly met with US special envoy Adam Boehler and former envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to discuss developing bilateral relations, citizen-related issues, and investment opportunities in Afghanistan. While the Taliban published photos, the US has not yet corroborated their claims. This interaction follows the recent release of US citizen George Glezmann, abducted in December 2022, marking the third such release since President Donald Trump began his second term, underscoring the administration's priority on freeing overseas detainees.

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer explicitly questioned Lord Mandelson about his links to convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US. This vetting occurred after initial checks flagged Mandelson's relationship with Epstein, including queries about continued contact post-conviction and reported stays at Epstein's properties. Despite Mandelson's assurances, new emails, including supportive messages sent after Epstein's 2008 conviction for child sexual procurement, later emerged, leading to Mandelson's swift sacking. The incident has intensified scrutiny on Sir Keir's judgment and the thoroughness of the vetting process within Downing Street, causing a political crisis.</p>

          <p>The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly voted 142-10 to back a nonbinding resolution endorsing the "New York Declaration," urging Israel to commit to a Palestinian state and supporting a two-state solution. This declaration, sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, also condemns attacks by both Hamas and Israel on civilians and infrastructure, and calls for Hamas to end its rule in Gaza, handing over weapons to the Palestinian Authority. Despite the broad international support for peace, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the notion of a Palestinian state, and the US dismissed the resolution as a "misguided publicity stunt" that benefits Hamas.</p>

          <p>Nepal's major political parties have united to demand the reinstatement of the parliament, which President Ram Chandra Poudel dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. They argue that Poudel's action, taken upon the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki and a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, was unconstitutional and against judicial precedents. The protests, sparked by a social media ban, escalated due to deeper discontent with the political elite, resulting in over 50 deaths. While Karki, the first female PM, is seen as having a clean image, her interim government faces significant challenges in restoring order and addressing public demands for systemic change and accountability.</p>

          <p>Illinois lawmakers and local officials are demanding a full investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during a traffic stop in Franklin Park. They argue that a traffic violation should never result in death, attributing the incident to the Trump administration's "anti-immigrant agenda" and its associated violence. ICE claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer, but surveillance videos offer a complex view of the events, showing agents breaking into his car. This killing occurred amidst "Operation Midway Blitz," a ramped-up ICE operation in Chicago, raising significant concerns about the agency's tactics and accountability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to NATO allies, stating the US will impose "major" sanctions on Russia only if all NATO nations agree to do the same and cease buying Russian oil. He also called for NATO countries to significantly increase tariffs on China, suggesting 50% to 100% tariffs, to pressure an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump criticized NATO's commitment, highlighting some members' continued purchase of Russian fossil fuels, which he believes weakens their negotiating position. This demand marks a potential dramatic shift in alliance policy and raises questions about collective interest, as the EU has already banned maritime Russian oil imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Georgia judge dismissed RICO conspiracy charges against 61 defendants involved in protests against the "Cop City" police training center, marking a significant setback for prosecutors. Judge Kevin Farmer ruled that the state attorney general lacked the authority to bring the RICO case without special permission from the governor, which was not obtained. This decision, nearly three years after arrests, invalidates most of the indictment and exposes prosecutorial negligence, including violations of attorney-client privilege. Critics argue the case was an overblown attempt to criminalize a protest movement, drawing comparisons to other politically charged cases where charges were ultimately dismissed, highlighting the challenges of using such laws against dissent.</p>

          <p>As lip oils gain popularity for their glossy and hydrating properties, a doctor advises consumers to prioritize ingredients over brand names, especially amidst concerns about hyperpigmentation. Dr. Rebecca Small explains that the thin skin on lips is susceptible to sun damage and inflammation, which can be exacerbated by lip oils lacking SPF or containing irritants like certain plumping agents or fragrances. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or dermatitis can result from such products, particularly for women of color. The article recommends seeking lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF, linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid, while actively avoiding fragrances and oleic acids, to ensure optimal lip health.</p>

Critics, including the Conservatives, have questioned the policy's workability and potential for abuse, while MPs are set to question the Home Secretary.
