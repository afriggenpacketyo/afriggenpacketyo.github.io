          <p>Penn State University has fired longtime head football coach James Franklin following a stunning 22-21 home loss to Northwestern. The defeat was the final blow for the Nittany Lions, who began the season ranked No. 2 with national championship aspirations but have since fallen to a 3-3 record. The school announced that Terry Smith will serve as the interim head coach for the rest of the season, marking an abrupt end to Franklin's tenure, which comes with a nearly $50 million buyout.</p>

          <p>An advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed strong faith in the Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump, stating it provides a framework to dismantle Hamas and ensure regional security. The plan's second phase reportedly calls for the demilitarization of Hamas and would be overseen by an International Stabilization Force operating in coordination with the IDF. While Israeli officials see the plan as a way to compel Hamas's compliance, some security experts have raised concerns about vague language regarding enforcement and verification.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance confirmed that the Trump administration is considering all options, including invoking the Insurrection Act, to address crime in major cities. This 1807 law would permit the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement, a measure rarely used in U.S. history. The discussion comes as the administration faces legal challenges in federal courts over its attempts to deploy National Guard forces in Democratic-run cities like Chicago, escalating tensions between federal and state governments over executive authority.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has sharply criticized Democrats over the ongoing government shutdown, accusing them of "hostage-taking" by refusing to pass a funding bill without an extension for Affordable Care Act tax credits. Vance stated that the administration will not negotiate on healthcare policy until the government is reopened, framing the Democratic position as an ultimatum. In response, Democrats maintain that the expiring subsidies represent an emergency for millions of Americans and that Republicans are boycotting necessary negotiations to resolve the impasse.</p>
