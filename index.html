          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has stated he anticipates the release of more embarrassing communications between himself and the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Following the publication of a letter where he called Epstein his "best pal," Mandelson expressed deep regret over the friendship, describing it as an "albatross around my neck" and acknowledging he was deceived by a "charismatic criminal liar." Despite the controversy, Downing Street has affirmed its confidence in Lord Mandelson, citing his crucial role in strengthening UK-US trade relations.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, known for producing the weight-loss drug Wegovy, has announced a major corporate restructuring that will eliminate approximately 9,000 jobs, representing about 11.5% of its global workforce. The company stated the transformation aims to simplify its organization, speed up decision-making, and redirect resources toward growth opportunities in the competitive diabetes and obesity markets. This move, which follows disappointing trial results for a new drug candidate and increased competition, is the first significant action by new CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar.</p>

While second-quarter sales were weaker than anticipated, this recent acceleration in momentum reassured investors and drove the stock price up. The positive performance of Inditex contributed to a broader rise in European stock markets, as investors also monitored inflation data and geopolitical trade news involving the US, EU, China, and India.</p>

          <p>Since seizing power in a 2022 coup, Burkina Faso's Captain Ibrahim Traore has crafted a public image as a young, anti-colonial revolutionary, drawing comparisons to historical African leaders on social media. However, this narrative contrasts sharply with the reality on the ground, where his military junta has failed to curb extremist violence, with jihadist groups now controlling an estimated 70% of the country. While consolidating power, Traore has postponed elections, suppressed dissent, and shifted alliances from France to Russia, using state-backed media to distract from domestic failures.</p>

          <p>Protesters organized under the online "Block Everything" movement have initiated widespread disruptions across France, leading to road blockades, fires, and clashes with police. The demonstrations, fueled by anger over President Emmanuel Macron's leadership and austerity policies, resulted in nearly 200 arrests as 80,000 police officers were deployed to manage the unrest. The movement, which lacks a clear leadership structure, aims to challenge the government just as Sébastien Lecornu was appointed as the new prime minister, the fourth in just twelve months.</p>

          <p>A German court has sentenced Issa Al H., a 27-year-old Syrian national, to life in prison for murdering three people and injuring ten others in a knife attack at a street festival in Solingen in August 2024. The court recognized the particular severity of the crime, which prosecutors described as an "Islamist-motivated act of terror" linked to the "Islamic State" group. The case has intensified Germany's debate on asylum and migration policies, as the attacker was a rejected asylum seeker whose deportation had been stalled by bureaucratic failures.</p>

          <p>Poland shot down several Russian drones that entered its airspace, an act its military called an "unprecedented violation" that occurred during a major Russian attack on western Ukraine. The incident, the first of its kind, prompted strong condemnation from European leaders, with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calling it "reckless" and vowing to increase pressure and sanctions on Moscow. Ukrainian officials described the incursion as Putin "testing the West," urging partners to urgently strengthen Ukraine's air defenses in response to the escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay contends that the rise of originalism, a judicial philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, has effectively killed the practice of formally amending the U.S. Constitution. The article traces how conservatives, after failing to pass amendments on issues like abortion and balanced budgets, shifted their strategy to reshaping the judiciary and constitutional interpretation. This has led to a 50-year drought in significant amendments, increased politicization of the Supreme Court, and trapped constitutional debates in a distorted version of the past, undermining the document's intended adaptability.</p>

If approved, the change would align card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, which have no transaction limit, and could make entering a PIN a rare occurrence. While the move reflects evolving payment habits, it has raised concerns about fraud, though the FCA insists providers would be responsible for losses and would only permit higher limits for low-risk transactions.</p>
