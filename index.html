          <p>The Pentagon has ordered 28 new B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, the same aircraft used in a recent 36-hour mission to strike three Iranian nuclear facilities. Commanders involved in the operation, called "Operation Midnight Hammer," described the aircraft's performance as perfect, highlighting its unique combination of long-range capability, high payload, and advanced stealth technology. Escorted by F-22 and F-35 fighters, the bombers delivered 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs designed to hit deep underground targets. The mission's success has reinforced the B-2's strategic importance in U.S. global operations and national defense.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced new default content settings for Instagram users under 18, aligning the platform's restrictions with the standards of a PG-13 movie rating. The update automatically places teen accounts under a "13+" setting, which blocks search results for sensitive terms like "gore" and prevents them from following or interacting with accounts that post age-inappropriate content. The company is also applying these regulations to its integrated AI and introducing an even more restrictive "Limited Content" setting for parents, aiming to provide a safer, more age-appropriate experience by default.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has confirmed that Hamas returned the bodies of four more deceased hostages, which were transferred via the Red Cross. This development occurred after Israel threatened to restrict humanitarian aid into Gaza until the remains of all 28 deceased hostages from the original agreement were repatriated. While all living hostages were released as part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire plan, the failure to return all the deceased has become a significant point of contention. Hamas has stated it has encountered difficulties in locating all the remains amid the widespread destruction in Gaza.</p>

          <p>While the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is holding, significant challenges are testing the peace plan, including the urgent need for humanitarian aid and the return of 24 deceased Israeli hostages. International organizations are calling for all border crossings to be opened to address the severe shortages of food, water, and building materials in the devastated territory. Simultaneously, the failure of Hamas to return all hostage remains has created a major sticking point, with Israeli officials calling it a violation of the agreement.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of six foreign nationals from different countries for making social media comments that celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The department stated that the U.S. has no obligation to host individuals who wish death upon Americans and will continue to identify others who made similar remarks. This action coincides with President Trump posthumously awarding Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom and reflects the administration's broader crackdown on immigration, which includes increased social media vetting for visa holders and applicants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50%, on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets, lumber, and other housewares officially took effect on Tuesday. The administration argues the levies are necessary for national security and to protect U.S. manufacturing from unfair foreign competition. However, most economists predict that American consumers and businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of the increased costs, potentially leading to higher prices for home building and remodeling. Recent data already shows a significant rise in furniture prices, partly driven by existing tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors had alleged Shockley killed the trooper to stop an investigation into a fatal car accident. A deadlocked jury led a judge to impose the death sentence.</p>

The research, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, showed that while all mothers in the study reported improvement, those in the singing group continued to see benefits for six months after the sessions ended. The program, called "Melodies for Mums," helps foster social connection and relaxation, and early results suggest it may lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

Users, including a former Australian Paralympic swimmer missing part of her arm, have found that prompts for images of people with physical differences are often ignored or altered by AI systems, which default to generating images of able-bodied individuals. This issue highlights how AI models, trained on existing internet data, reflect and perpetuate societal inequalities and a lack of representation.

This strategy, which also includes an acquisition of designer Jony Ive's firm to explore consumer hardware, mirrors Apple's playbook of owning the infrastructure, hardware, and developer platform.

          <p>Automaker Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler, has announced a $13 billion investment in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the next four years. The plan is a key part of a domestic turnaround strategy and is expected to add more than 5,000 jobs while increasing U.S. production by 50%. The investments will bring new vehicles, including a midsize truck and a new Dodge Durango, to plants in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. This move aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to boost domestic manufacturing through tariffs and other incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a record amount of newly installed renewable energy capacity in 2024, the world is not on track to meet its climate goals, according to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The 15.1% growth last year was the highest ever recorded but falls short of the 16.6% annual increase needed to achieve the 2030 targets set at the COP28 climate conference. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the window to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is rapidly closing and called for an accelerated energy transition.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a historic high of $4,000 an ounce, a spike that analysts view as an ominous indicator of global instability and economic pessimism. This rally is driven by several factors, including widespread geopolitical turmoil, a weakening U.S. dollar, and aggressive buying from central banks in emerging markets seeking to insulate themselves from U.S. policy and sanctions. The trend reflects a deep-seated fear among investors about inflation and the long-term stability of the current financial system, making the precious metal a preferred safe-haven asset.

          <p>The rapid growth and technological advancement of China's electric vehicle (EV) industry are causing concern within the European Union, which is now considering setting up trade barriers to protect its own automakers. This situation marks a significant reversal from decades ago, when European companies like Volkswagen helped modernize China's state-run auto factories. Now, Chinese EV manufacturers pose a formidable competitive threat, prompting the EU to explore measures to counter what it perceives as an uneven playing field. The potential for cooperation remains, but the current trajectory points towards increasing trade friction.</p>

Brockman was held for seven hours before being released without charges. Her legal team states she feared for her life during the encounter and plans to pursue all available legal avenues in response to the incident.</p>

          <p>For Palestinians in Gaza, the recent ceasefire has brought a conflicted sense of relief, mixing joy with profound despair over the immense loss of life and property. While the daily bombardments have stopped, the future remains deeply uncertain as Hamas forces reassert control in the streets and the monumental task of rebuilding has yet to begin. Many residents are only now getting the chance to search for the bodies of loved ones under the rubble or to grieve properly after two years of sustained conflict. The fragile peace is a welcome respite, but the lack of clarity on long-term governance and reconstruction fuels anxiety.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton, once a fan of the Milwaukee Brewers, is now publicly rooting against his former favorite team during their playoff run. Haliburton explained that his change of heart came after the Brewers allegedly canceled his scheduled ceremonial first pitch last summer, an action he believes was retaliation for his Pacers eliminating the Milwaukee Bucks from the NBA playoffs. In response, he has been trolling the baseball team by wearing the jerseys of their opponents, including the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers, to his own preseason games.</p>

          <p>Manhattan prosecutors are considering whether to retry Pedro Hernandez for a third time for the 1979 murder of six-year-old Etan Patz. This comes after a federal appeals court overturned his 2017 conviction, citing flawed jury instructions regarding the voluntariness of his confession. The disappearance of Etan Patz became a landmark case that drew national attention to missing children. Hernandez's defense is pushing for his immediate release, arguing an innocent man is in jail, while prosecutors maintain the conviction was just and are considering an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in La Cañada Flintridge has laid off 550 employees, reducing its workforce by over 10% due to ongoing federal budgetary challenges. Officials stated the cuts are part of a necessary reorganization to create a leaner infrastructure and are not directly related to the current government shutdown. This action follows previous rounds of layoffs and has contributed to what employees describe as the lowest morale in decades. The continued uncertainty over funding for key missions, including the Mars Sample Return, has left the future of the renowned research facility in limbo.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to consider "terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil" as a form of retribution for Beijing's refusal to purchase U.S. soybeans. In a social media post, Trump labeled China's actions an "Economically Hostile Act" designed to harm American farmers. Since May, China has not bought any U.S. soybeans amid the escalating trade war, turning instead to South American suppliers. The threat adds further volatility to U.S.-China trade relations and caused an immediate dip in the S&P 500 stock index. (not investment advice)</p>
