          <p>President Trump expressed optimism about upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, stating his intention to continue working with both sides to end the conflict. Trump highlighted the potential to save lives and focus on rebuilding and trade, but his previous efforts have not yielded lasting results. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy also signaled a positive outlook following discussions with European leaders, proposing a ceasefire starting May 12. Putin offered direct talks in Istanbul on Thursday, with Zelenskyy responding positively to the possibility of a ceasefire, marking a potentially significant step towards de-escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 04:17:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, encourages mothers to ease the pressure of striving for perfection, noting that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance. She argues that the constant messaging implying mothers aren't doing enough stems partly from historical biases in psychiatry, where mothers were often blamed for their children's problems. Ross emphasizes that flawed caregivers teach children about the importance of give and take in relationships and the acceptance of imperfections, advising mothers to embrace their imperfections and prioritize their own well-being.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, ultimately leading to her death. Harris's mother became suspicious after discovering Sarah with slurred speech and drug vials, and later, authorities found powerful surgical anesthetics in Sarah's system. Texts revealed Ryan offered drugs to alleviate anxiety and administered them while Sarah was asleep, creating a chemical dependency. Ryan was convicted of drug distribution, intent to distribute, and depraved heart murder, receiving a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year, while 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors like global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season, as sales of previously occupied homes declined in March.</p>
