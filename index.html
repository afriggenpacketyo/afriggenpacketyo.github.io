          <p>Alaska Airlines resumed flights after a nationwide ground stop caused by a technology outage, leading to disruptions. Operations were restored early Friday morning, but the airline is working to get back on track after canceling over 400 flights on Alaska and Horizon Air. More than 49,000 passengers experienced travel disruptions, and the airline has issued an apology and implemented a flexible travel policy. The carrier did not provide details about the specific nature of the tech outage that prompted the FAA to issue a ground stop. Alaska Airlines operates primarily on the West Coast, serving 140 destinations worldwide.</p>

          <p>Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell defended his decision to keep quarterback Carson Wentz in the game despite a significant loss to the Chargers and Wentz's apparent shoulder discomfort. O'Connell stated that he repeatedly checked with Wentz, who insisted he was able to continue playing and felt confident in his throwing ability. Reserve quarterback Max Brosmer entered the game briefly in the fourth quarter, and O'Connell acknowledged considering using him earlier but weighed Wentz's experience against asking a rookie to navigate a difficult situation. McCarthy is expected to return as the starting quarterback in Week 9 against the Lions if he recovers fully from his ankle injury, as the Vikings have now lost back-to-back games. The team's current record stands at 3-4, and Wentz was seen slamming his helmet on the sideline in frustration, yet he maintained that the injury did not affect his throwing ability. </p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, posing a threat of catastrophic flash flooding and landslides to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The storm is expected to become a Category 4 hurricane, potentially the strongest to impact Jamaica in over 35 years. Hurricane conditions are anticipated to first affect southern Haiti on Saturday and then reach Jamaica by Saturday night or Sunday morning. Melissa's slow movement is expected to continue, allowing it to intensify significantly, with rainfall amounts of 15-25 inches expected in portions of southwestern Haiti and eastern Jamaica. The storm has already caused one death in Haiti due to a downed tree.</p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that the province would pause its anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the U.S. after President Trump terminated trade talks. The decision came after Ford spoke with Prime Minister Mark Carney and agreed to pause the TV spot on Monday so that trade talks could resume. Trump criticized the ad, which quoted former President Ronald Reagan saying tariffs hurt every American, calling it fake and egregious. Ford stated that the intention of the advert was to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Isabelle Tate, an actor who appeared in "9-1-1: Nashville," passed away at the age of 23 due to a rare form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Tate's talent agency and family confirmed her death, noting she had recently returned to acting and enjoyed her role in the series. In 2022, Tate shared her diagnosis of a progressive neuromuscular disease that weakened her legs, leading her to use a wheelchair at times. Her family has requested memorial contributions be made to the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association to support research and treatment for the disease. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of inherited conditions causing nerve damage and muscle weakness, with symptoms typically appearing in adolescence or early adulthood.</p>

          <p>An attorney for Byron Black, a man executed in Tennessee, alleges that an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sustained cardiac activity for nearly two minutes after he was pronounced dead. The allegation raises questions about the execution process and scrutiny of capital punishment in Tennessee. Black's lawyer, Kelley Henry, stated that this evidence suggests the sedative pentobarbital did not work as intended, and that Black may have still been alive when the official checked him. She also noted that the EKG record stopped altogether, so it is possible his cardiac activity continued, and argued that the public and his attorneys didn't have an opportunity to see if there was additional suffering. Black was executed for the 1988 homicides of his girlfriend and her two daughters.</p>

The ad, sponsored by the province of Ontario, used excerpts from a 1987 Reagan address to argue against tariffs. Trump accused the ad of misleadingly portraying Reagan as someone who disliked tariffs, while the Reagan Foundation stated that the ad misrepresented Reagan's address. The ad correctly reflected Reagan's defense of free trade but omitted his defense of tariffs on imports from Japan. This dispute led to Trump terminating trade talks with Canada.</p>

Finance chief Steven Fasching noted that tariffs and higher prices are impacting consumer behavior in the U.S. The slower growth of these top-performing lines suggests a potential loss of momentum after years of outperformance. Full-year revenue guidance also came in lower than analysts' expectations, and tariff costs could total about $150 million this fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump halted all trade negotiations with Canada earlier this week over an advert in which former President Ronald Reagan says tariffs "hurt every American". The ad, sponsored by Canada's province of Ontario and released last week, features excerpts of an address Reagan gave in 1987 focusing on foreign trade. Trump called the advert "FAKE" while The Ronald Reagan Foundation said it "misrepresents" the former president's address. Ontario later said it would stop running it so trade talks could resume, as the White House on Friday signalled frustration with what it called "Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers,".</p>

The development marks a milestone in IBM's path toward debuting a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029. The technology utilizes quantum mechanics to address problems that traditional computers are unable to solve, and technology giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are also developing quantum computing. The news brought renewed interest to the quantum space, boosting stocks like D-Wave Quantum, Rigetti Computing, and IonQ. (not investment advice)</p>

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign will be put on hold starting Monday "so that trade talks can resume." He said he's told his team to "keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games."</p>

          <p>The Pentagon said on Friday that it was deploying the United States’s most advanced aircraft carrier to the Caribbean, a major escalation in the Trump administration’s war against drug cartels that provides the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. The move will bring the USS Gerald Ford carrier, with dozens of stealth fighter jets and surveillance aircraft, in addition to other warships that accompany the carrier, to the coast of Venezuela as it nears the end of its current deployment in the Mediterranean. Sending the carrier strike group to the Caribbean is the clearest sign to date that the administration intends to dramatically expand the scope of its lethal military campaign from hitting small boats alleged to be carrying drugs bound for the US to targets on land.</p>

          <p>The US military has been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, bombers, marines, drones and spy planes in the Caribbean Sea, which is the largest deployment there for decades. The US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry "narcotics" and "narco-terrorists", without providing evidence or details about those on board. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality, as they are being sold by the US as a war on drug trafficking but all the signs suggest this is really an intimidation campaign that seeks to remove Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro from power.</p>

          <p>Pakistan banned a hard-line Islamist party, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), after clashes with police resulted in multiple deaths. The ban, approved by the federal cabinet, cites violent and terrorist activities, as the TLP has amassed considerable grassroots support for its hard-line views on blasphemy. The TLP demands death as a punishment for blasphemy, and human rights groups say the party's supporters sometimes carry out brutal mob lynchings. The move to ban the party came from the government in Punjab, where the recent protests took place, and police have raided the house of the TLP's leader, Saad Rizvi.</p>

The decision stems from an appeal by the Trump administration to reverse judges in Chicago who blocked the deployment of the National Guard. Administration lawyers argue the power to deploy the National Guard is at the president's discretion. Legal experts and Democratic officials warn of the dangers of unchecked presidential power, while conservatives argue Trump is seeking to enforce federal law.</p>

Earl and Jake Reeves are the first to be convicted of offences under the National Security Act 2023, which tackles threats falling short of traditional spying. The warehouse was used to send goods to Ukraine, and the attack was described as a planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage in the interests of the Russian state.</p>
