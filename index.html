        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock value decreased by 6% following a record-setting rally earlier in the week. This reversal was prompted by an analyst report highlighting that a substantial portion of the company's future growth is tied to a single client, OpenAI, which is reportedly set to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years for cloud infrastructure. While Oracle had announced massive new contracts that swelled its performance obligation, the market's enthusiasm cooled upon realizing the significant customer concentration. This situation underscores investor concerns about the sustainability and diversification of the company's revenue streams in the competitive AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has initiated an investigation into seven major technology companies, including Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and Snap, regarding the potential negative effects of their AI chatbots on children and teenagers. The agency is seeking information on the safety measures these companies have implemented, particularly when chatbots act as companions, and how they handle personal data and mitigate harmful impacts. This probe reflects growing regulatory concern over the societal effects of AI, especially as the technology becomes more integrated into young people's lives for communication and emotional support.

          <p>A debate is unfolding in Germany over the relevance of the traditional literary canon, which predominantly features authors like Goethe and other classic white male writers, in today's multicultural classrooms. With over 25% of the German population having an immigrant background, students and some educators are calling for a more diverse curriculum that includes contemporary authors and voices relevant to their lives. While education authorities are making some moves to include more modern texts, they face challenges related to cost and teacher training. The discussion highlights the tension between preserving cultural heritage and adapting education to better engage a new generation of students.</p>

The development comes amid a wave of transformation and expected consolidation within the media industry as companies grapple with the shift from traditional pay TV to streaming.

          <p>Gregory Bovino, the agent who led aggressive immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles, has reportedly arrived in Chicago to spearhead a new DHS initiative named "Operation Midway Blitz." This operation is modeled after the Los Angeles efforts and aims to target what the department calls the "worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens." The move has drawn sharp criticism from Illinois leaders, including Governor JB Pritzker, who view it as an implementation of the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.

          <p>A majority of justices on a Brazilian Supreme Court panel have voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro for his role in a plot to overturn the 2022 election results and remain in power. The ruling finds him guilty of leading a criminal organization that culminated in the January 8th storming of government buildings by his supporters. This landmark conviction could result in a lengthy prison sentence and will likely deepen political polarization in Brazil. The trial has also drawn international attention, with the Trump administration in the U.S. having previously criticized the proceedings as a politically motivated "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has triggered an outpouring of grief and rage across social media, particularly among right-wing influencers and politicians. While many mourned his death, others quickly blamed left-wing rhetoric for creating a climate conducive to such violence, a sentiment echoed by President Trump. The event has intensified political polarization, with some commentators declaring that debate is over and calling for retribution. This reaction highlights the volatile state of American political discourse, where a violent act is immediately framed within a narrative of partisan warfare, potentially fueling further division and conflict regardless of the shooter's actual motives.</p>

The lawsuit, filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), seeks to force Uber to modify its policies, in addition to seeking monetary damages and civil penalties.

The proposal has created a contentious debate, pitting environmental advocates and actor Mark Ruffalo against the cookware industry and celebrity chefs like Rachael Ray and Thomas Keller. Opponents argue that the specific type of PFAS used in nonstick coatings, PTFE (Teflon), is inert and safe when used correctly, as affirmed by the FDA.

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving forward with a controversial change to chamber rules that would make it easier to confirm President Trump's executive branch nominees. The proposed change, which Democrats have warned against as a "nuclear" option, would allow for confirming nominees in groups, thereby bypassing procedural delays that have stalled many appointments. Republicans argue the move is necessary to overcome an unprecedented blockade by Democrats and allow the president to staff his administration. Democrats counter that Republicans are weakening the Senate's deliberative role and walked away from a potential bipartisan compromise on the issue.</p>

          <h2>Inflation Data Shows Trump's Tariffs Are Increasingly Affecting Consumer Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 14:52:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government inflation report indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to rising prices for a range of consumer goods. The data for August showed price increases in tariff-sensitive categories such as apparel, electronics, auto parts, and furniture, with grocery prices also seeing their largest monthly jump since 2022. This trend is creating a "middle-class squeeze" as the cost of basic necessities increases at a time when the labor market is showing signs of weakness. The persistent inflation presents a complex challenge for the Federal Reserve as it weighs potential interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New estimates based on the latest inflation data suggest that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would represent a slight increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $54. While higher than this year's adjustment, the projection is still modest compared to the record increases seen during the post-pandemic inflation surge. The potential COLA increase comes as retirees express concern that rising costs for essentials like Medicare premiums could outpace the growth in their benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data shows healthcare inflation is outpacing the overall rate, with medical care costs rising 4.2% annually. This trend is driving up health insurance costs, with large employers projecting a 9% average increase in their health coverage expenses for 2026, the largest jump since 2010. The surge is fueled by rising prices for hospital services and expensive prescription drugs, particularly new treatments for cancer and obesity. While companies are hesitant to pass these costs on to employees, the significant increase in spending may force them to consider raising premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for workers.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced details of the profit-sharing agreement tied to the recent U.S.-Japan tariff deal. Under the arrangement, Japan will invest $550 billion into U.S.-based manufacturing and infrastructure projects, and the two countries will split the resulting profits 50/50 until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit share will shift dramatically to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. Lutnick framed the deal as highly favorable for America, providing significant capital for domestic priorities like nuclear power plants while ultimately costing Japanese taxpayers nothing if the projects are successful.

          <p>During a visit to a settlement in the occupied West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unequivocally stated that "there will be no Palestinian state." His remarks were made as he formally signed an agreement for the construction of thousands of new homes in the controversial E1 area. This settlement project is widely condemned internationally because it effectively severs East Jerusalem from the West Bank, making a contiguous Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem geographically impossible. Netanyahu's declaration represents a firm rejection of the two-state solution long favored by the international community.</p>

The incident prompted diplomatic discussions between the U.S. and South Korea, with President Lee Jae Myung calling for improvements to the U.S. visa system.

          <p>A bill under consideration in the California Legislature, AB 1178, is drawing criticism from press advocates and police watchdogs for potentially expanding secrecy around police misconduct records. Opponents argue that last-minute amendments to the bill would allow law enforcement agencies to withhold records for any officer who has worked undercover, received a threat, or served on a task force. While the bill's author states it is narrowly targeted to protect active undercover officers, critics fear it could gut recent transparency laws by creating broad exemptions. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between calls for police accountability and efforts to protect officer privacy and safety.</p>

Routh, who is representing himself, is accused of positioning himself with a rifle near Trump's golf club with the intent to kill the then-presidential candidate. In opening statements, prosecutors argued Routh's plot was "carefully crafted and deadly serious," aimed at taking the electoral choice away from voters. A former Secret Service agent testified about encountering Routh in what he described as a "textbook ambush scenario," identifying him as the gunman who aimed a weapon at him.</p>
