          <h2>Yale University Analysis Finds Republican Spending Bill Would Benefit High Earners at the Expense of Low-Income Households</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the proposed Republican legislative package would disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans while financially harming the lowest-earning households. The report projects that from 2026 to 2034, the bottom 20% of earners would see an average income reduction of 2.9%, primarily due to significant cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Conversely, the top 20% of households would experience an average income increase of 2.2%, driven by the extension of various tax cuts. These findings align with other nonpartisan analyses suggesting the bill's net effects would be regressive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea is reportedly preparing to send an additional 6,000 military engineers and workers to Russia's Kursk region to aid in the war against Ukraine, deepening military ties between the two nations. This move follows an agreement where Pyongyang has already supplied Moscow with over 10 million artillery rounds in exchange for economic aid and military technology. Analysts suggest the arrangement is mutually beneficial, providing Russia with needed manpower without expanding domestic mobilization, while offering North Korea international prestige and resources to support its regime. Despite significant casualties among North Korean troops already deployed, the alliance appears set to continue long-term.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals, Yuance Chen and Liren Lai, with acting as agents for China's Ministry of State Security (MSS). They were arrested for allegedly gathering intelligence on U.S. Navy personnel and bases, attempting to recruit military members, and facilitating a cash payment for the MSS. The FBI alleges the pair visited a naval installation and recruitment center, where they photographed information about recruits. The charges claim their activities were part of a broader effort by the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate and undermine U.S. institutions. If convicted, the men face up to 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A public dispute has reignited between Donald Trump and Elon Musk regarding a massive Republican-led budget proposal, with Trump threatening to use a government efficiency agency to investigate subsidies for Musk's companies. Musk has been a vocal critic of the bill, arguing it increases the national debt and undermines his previous cost-cutting efforts. In response, Trump suggested Musk's opposition stems from the bill's removal of electric vehicle tax credits, a claim Musk denies while advocating for cutting all government subsidies. The feud highlights a significant ideological rift between the former allies over fiscal policy and government spending.</p>

Experts express concern for open-air archaeological sites like Taq-e Bostan, which are difficult to protect from potential damage. In Israel, museums in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem have also secured their collections in underground storage.

          <p>An investigative report from ProPublica alleges that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem failed to disclose an $80,000 payment she received from a nonprofit group while serving as governor of South Dakota. The payment was reportedly for fundraising assistance to the American Resolve Policy Fund, a dark money group that later ran attack ads against news outlets critical of Noem's spending. While not necessarily illegal, the lack of disclosure has raised ethical questions about transparency. Noem's lawyer stated that she fully complied with all laws and that the Office of Government Ethics had cleared her financial information.</p>

          <p>The federal trial of Sean Combs has entered jury deliberations, where jurors must weigh conflicting narratives presented over nearly two months of testimony. Prosecutors portrayed Combs as a violent and controlling figure who used his resources to coerce women into illegal sex acts, charging him with sex trafficking and racketeering. The defense, while not disputing claims of domestic abuse, argued that the sexual encounters were consensual and did not constitute a criminal enterprise under federal law. Legal experts note the complexity of the charges, with racketeering being particularly broad, while the sex trafficking charge hinges on proving a lack of consent.</p>

          <p>The e-commerce sector is facing its most significant slowdown in over a decade, largely driven by President Trump's tariff policies, according to a new survey. The data reveals double-digit declines in online purchases for home delivery across major categories like office supplies and furniture, as consumers delay purchases or seek domestic alternatives due to price uncertainty. In response to rising costs, many retailers are tightening their shipping and return policies, such as increasing minimum order values for free shipping. The findings suggest that tariffs are materially influencing consumer behavior and forcing retailers to reassess their sourcing and pricing strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

The process, known as a "vote-a-rama," allows for unlimited amendments, which Democrats used to force votes on controversial topics like cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Despite the procedural delays and opposition from a few Republican holdouts concerned about Medicaid cuts and the bill's $3.3 trillion impact on the deficit, GOP leaders have advanced the legislation. The bill, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense, must return to the House for approval of any Senate changes.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly close to finalizing another major aircraft deal with European manufacturer Airbus, potentially for 100 to 200 new jets, further isolating U.S. rival Boeing. Amid ongoing trade tensions with Washington and safety concerns surrounding Boeing, Beijing has increasingly favored Airbus for its commercial aircraft needs since 2017. This potential new order follows a $20 billion deal for 160 Airbus jets signed just two years ago. While the shift benefits Airbus, analysts note it could create challenges for Chinese airlines that operate Boeing-only fleets, highlighting the geopolitical and commercial complexities of the global aviation market.</p>

          <p>A new biography examines the career of Claire McCardell, a revolutionary American fashion designer from the mid-20th century whose influence remains widespread yet often uncredited. McCardell championed comfortable, practical clothing for women, introducing innovations like pockets, side fasteners, ballet flats, and denim for womenswear. She rejected the restrictive European styles of the era, focusing instead on an "American Look" that prioritized freedom of movement and ease of wear for active women. Though a household name in her time, her legacy is less prominent than contemporaries like Christian Dior, yet her design philosophy is embedded in modern everyday apparel.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility, located at an isolated airstrip, was rapidly established to support the administration's intensified immigration crackdown and is expected to hold up to 5,000 detainees. The project has drawn swift backlash from a coalition of environmentalists, immigration advocates, and Native American groups. Opponents have filed a lawsuit to block the facility, citing a lack of environmental review and concerns over detainee welfare in the harsh, hurricane-prone environment and its impact on a fragile ecosystem.</p>
