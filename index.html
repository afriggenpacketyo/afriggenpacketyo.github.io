        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores India's recent diplomatic overtures towards China, characterized by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agreement with President Xi Jinping to be "partners" rather than "rivals." The shift, marked by Modi's first visit to China in seven years and the resumption of direct flights, suggests India is strategically hedging its geopolitical bets. While appearing to be a subtle jab at the US, it also represents India's effort to reset historically strained ties with China. Both nations envision their relationship as a cornerstone of a multipolar world order and a new Asian century, emphasizing cooperation in the Global South.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts backup quarterback Anthony Richardson was hospitalized after sustaining an orbital fracture during pre-game warmups for their game against the Arizona Cardinals. The incident, caused by a malfunctioning elastic exercise band hitting his face, led to his immediate medical attention. Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in 2023, has had an NFL career marked by both significant potential and a series of injuries and inconsistent performance. His current absence further emphasizes the team's reliance on starter Daniel Jones, who has guided the Colts to a commendable 5-1 record despite these challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer identifies a significant, underappreciated risk to the stock market rally: a potential flood of secondary stock offerings from highly speculative, unprofitable companies. Despite recent market volatility often attributed to US-China trade tensions, Cramer argues that the true danger lies in companies like IonQ issuing large amounts of new shares after substantial retail-driven price increases. He warns this influx of supply could mirror the dot-com bubble burst of 2000, impacting the broader market. Investors are advised to be cautious with these "Denizens of Sherwood Forest" stocks, as their underwriting could dilute value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance warned that further "painful" job cuts are imminent if the government shutdown persists, adding to thousands already axed. He attributed the impasse to Democrats, who insist on including health insurance subsidies in the spending bill, a demand Republicans reject. The Trump administration has already initiated layoffs across several agencies, though some CDC employees were incorrectly notified and later reinstated. Essential workers, including military personnel, are working without pay, with the Department of Defense using emergency funds to ensure troops receive wages this week.</p>

          <p>Scotland has significantly clarified its path to the 2026 World Cup finals, now guaranteed to finish in the top two of their qualification group, securing at least a play-off berth.

Both nations currently share 10 points, though Denmark holds a substantial goal difference advantage, which would be the tie-breaker. Scotland will first travel to face Greece next month, followed by a critical winner-takes-all encounter against Denmark at Hampden on November 18.</p>

          <p>Penn State has fired head football coach James Franklin, less than 24 hours after a 22-21 home loss to Northwestern effectively ended the preseason No. 2 team's College Football Playball hopes. Terry Smith will serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season for the Nittany Lions, who now stand at 3-3. The dismissal follows a string of disappointing losses, including an overtime defeat to Oregon and a road loss to previously winless UCLA. This article highlights the significant financial implications, as Franklin is reportedly owed nearly $50 million.</p>

          <p>Fierce internal clashes in Gaza City between Hamas security forces and armed members of the prominent Dughmush family have resulted in at least 27 fatalities. The confrontation, one of the most violent internal incidents since major Israeli operations ceased, saw masked Hamas gunmen exchanging fire with clan fighters near a hospital. Hamas's interior ministry stated its forces were restoring order against an "armed assault by a militia," while Dughmush sources claimed Hamas sought to evict them from a refuge building. Residents described panic as families fled, highlighting the internal instability within the war-torn enclave.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance claimed there is "a lot of waste and fraud" within Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which are central to the ongoing government shutdown. He argued that while some individuals deserve the credits, much of the funding benefits the insurance industry unnecessarily, advocating for targeted distribution to those truly in need. Democrats, however, demand the extension of enhanced Obamacare subsidies, warning that their expiration would drastically increase premiums for millions. Vance accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" by linking government funding to this healthcare policy, intensifying the political stalemate that has led to federal worker layoffs.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance declared the Trump administration's intent to "litigate this as much as we can" to deploy the National Guard in the Chicago area, despite recent federal appeals court rulings blocking such moves.

          <p>A Texas student, Megan Ashlee Davis, is speaking out after a fabricated social media post, featuring her real mugshot, falsely claimed she was an Olive Garden waitress arrested for throwing breadsticks at customers. Davis describes the experience as her "worst nightmare coming to reality," as the viral hoax has led to harassment and inappropriate comments, despite the original post being taken down. Her mugshot stems from an August arrest for public intoxication, occurring weeks after her mother's death.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance confirmed that the Trump administration is "looking at all options," including the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act, to deploy military troops on US soil to quell domestic unrest. This consideration arises amidst legal challenges to federal efforts to send National Guard forces into Democratic-run cities like Chicago. Vance justified the potential use of this emergency power, last activated in 1992, by citing concerns over rising crime rates and "lawlessness." The article highlights escalating tensions between the administration and Democratic governors, with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accusing Vance of "tidal wave of lies" and rejecting federal intervention.</p>

          <p>China's government has accused the US of "double standards" following President Donald Trump's threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, warning of unspecified "countermeasures." A commerce ministry spokesperson stated China is "not afraid" of a trade war, criticizing US export restrictions on chips while defending its own rare earths export controls as national security measures. Trump's renewed tariff threats, which previously rattled financial markets, come after China tightened rules on rare earth exports, essential for advanced tech.

          <p>Madagascar's presidency has announced an ongoing attempt to seize power illegally and by force, just hours before an army unit, CAPSAT, claimed control of all armed forces. This development follows youth-led protests against water and power cuts, which have escalated into broader dissatisfaction over unemployment and cost-of-living issues. President Andry Rajoelina, whose whereabouts are unclear, condemned the destabilization efforts and called for national unity. CAPSAT, instrumental in Rajoelina's 2009 rise to power, has now appointed a new army chief, further intensifying the political crisis and prompting Air France to suspend flights.</p>
