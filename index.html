          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 16:49:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of infusing everyday life with small, intentional moments of happiness, similar to those experienced on vacation. It suggests that rather than pursuing grand, intimidating goals, individuals can find more consistent contentment through simple rituals. The author shares personal examples, such as enjoying a mocktail and reading, and collects tips from colleagues, which range from tending to houseplants and journaling about gratitude to starting a daily poetry habit. These small acts are presented as an accessible way to improve overall mood and mental well-being, making regular life feel a bit more special.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, met with a top Department of Justice official for a second day, where she was reportedly questioned about approximately 100 different people. Her lawyer stated that Maxwell answered every question truthfully and did not hold anything back, describing her as a "scapegoat" who has been treated unfairly. The meeting comes amid public pressure for more information about Epstein's network. When asked about a potential pardon for Maxwell, President Trump stated it was not something he had considered, while her lawyer confirmed that no offers of clemency have been made in exchange for her cooperation.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving a life sentence in Idaho for the murders of her two children, has been given two additional life sentences in Arizona. This conviction is for conspiring to murder her former husband, Charles Vallow, and for the attempted murder of her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. During the emotional sentencing hearing, family members, including her surviving son Colby Ryan, delivered powerful victim impact statements, condemning her actions and lack of remorse. Daybell, who represented herself, was described as a "manipulator" and a "coward" by the grandmother of her murdered son, concluding the final trial in this high-profile case.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits Scotland to open a new golf course, local residents near the Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire express a range of opinions. Some neighbors, like David Milne, remain unhappy with the development, citing the disruption to the natural landscape and Trump's past treatment of property owners who refused to sell. Protests are planned, reflecting a broader sentiment in Scotland where polls show a high disapproval rating for the president. However, others acknowledge the economic benefits the course brings, such as local employment, creating a complex picture of the president's impact on the community where his mother was born.</p>

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her participation in a major identity theft scheme that benefited North Korea. She facilitated a plot where North Korean IT workers used stolen American identities to secure remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies, generating millions for the sanctioned regime's weapons programs. Chapman operated a "laptop farm" from her home, making it appear the workers were based in the U.S., and also shipped company equipment overseas. In a letter to the judge, she expressed remorse, stating she was ashamed of causing harm to identity theft victims.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, potentially funded by the significant revenue generated from his administration's new tariffs. He suggested the rebates could be targeted toward individuals below a certain income level, though specific details were not provided. The administration has collected around $100 billion in tariff revenue this year, which is paid by U.S. importers. While Trump also mentioned using the funds to pay down the national debt, the proposal for direct payments echoes previous pandemic-era stimulus checks and would likely require new legislation from Congress to authorize them.

          <p>The NFL has fined approximately 100 players and two dozen club employees for violating league policy by reselling their Super Bowl LIX tickets for a profit. An ongoing investigation uncovered the scalping scheme, where tickets were sold above face value, often to "bundlers" working for resellers. The league, which can digitally track ticket usage, is imposing significant financial penalties. Players involved will be fined 150 percent of the ticket's face value and will lose the privilege of purchasing future Super Bowl tickets, while club employees face a 200 percent fine.

The visit includes the promotion of his golf properties, with a new course set to open, alongside high-level trade discussions with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The trip has drawn scrutiny for its use of taxpayer funds to support the promotion of the president's private enterprises.

          <p>This article presents a satirical, first-person narrative from the perspective of Donald Trump, humorously explaining his association with Jeffrey Epstein as a series of misunderstandings and reluctant attendances at parties. In this fictionalized telling, Trump portrays himself as being single-mindedly obsessed with learning about tariffs from a biography of William McKinley, which he carries everywhere. He claims to have been roped into a "conspiracy" by a mysterious figure, leading to his presence in photos and on Epstein's plane, all while being comically oblivious to the sinister nature of the events around him. The piece uses absurdity to comment on the ongoing political controversy.</p>

The visit is shadowed by new reports about a birthday book for Epstein, which allegedly listed Trump as a contributor, and the ongoing DOJ interviews with convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell. While in Scotland, Trump is scheduled to meet with UK and EU leaders to discuss trade, but the persistent Epstein scandal continues to be a major point of public and media focus.</p>

Prosecutors stated he used campaign funds for personal enrichment, including luxury goods and Botox treatments. After his sentencing, Santos appealed to President Trump for a second chance, but the White House has not commented on any potential clemency request. His expulsion from Congress was a rare event in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is releasing more than $5 billion in federal grant funding to states that had been withheld for review, a decision that had left many school districts in a difficult position ahead of the new school year. The grants support a wide variety of programs, including professional development for teachers, services for English language learners, and adult education. The initial freeze of the funds, which had been previously approved and appropriated, drew bipartisan criticism and legal challenges from several states. Following intense lobbying, the Office of Management and Budget directed the Department of Education to disperse the funds to states starting next week.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI has partnered with prediction market platforms Kalshi and Polymarket to integrate its AI chatbot, Grok. The AI will be used to provide context and summaries on market fluctuations for users betting on the outcomes of real-world events, from elections to celebrity divorces. The move has raised some concerns, given Grok's history of generating controversial or biased content and the potential for conflicts of interest, such as providing information on wagers related to Elon Musk himself. Prediction markets, which proponents claim are more accurate than polls, allow users to gamble on future events, reflecting a "wisdom of the crowd." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's parliament has approved a new censorship law that imposes fines for searching for or accessing online content that the government deems "extremist." The legislation also penalizes the promotion of VPN services, which many Russians use to bypass existing state censorship. The country maintains a growing list of over 5,000 "extremist materials," which includes not only genuinely hateful content but also government criticism, independent journalism, and materials from groups like Jehovah's Witnesses. Critics, including some pro-Kremlin figures, have decried the law as a move toward "thoughtcrime," fearing it will be used to further suppress free speech and dissent.</p>

          <p>A recent USAID analysis reported by Reuters, which found no evidence of systematic aid theft by Hamas, is being heavily criticized as flawed and unreliable. This article argues the USAID study ignored extensive evidence, including testimonies from Gazans and Israeli intelligence, indicating Hamas regularly diverts humanitarian supplies. The USAID report itself acknowledged limitations, such as relying on self-reporting from aid groups operating in a Hamas-controlled environment. In contrast, Israeli officials maintain that Hamas diverts a significant portion of aid to fund its operations, a claim supported by recorded conversations with Palestinian civilians who describe a system of theft.</p>

          <p>This opinion article defends the widespread public humor surrounding the viral "kiss-cam" video of a CEO and his HR head, who were not married to each other, at a Coldplay concert. The author argues that rather than being a sign of a cruel "participatory sport" of public shaming, the laughter is a healthy societal reaction. It reflects that society still takes marriage vows seriously and recognizes the relatable, flawed aspects of human nature. The piece draws a parallel to George Orwell's analysis of crude postcards, suggesting that such lowbrow humor reinforces basic moral standards, making the incident's ridicule a positive social sign.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that there were failings in the care provided to former England cricketer Graham Thorpe in the months leading up to his death by suicide in August 2024. The inquest heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive him to be in a crisis situation, even after his wife reported that he was asking for help to end his life. The 55-year-old, who had been struggling with depression after losing his coaching job, had not been seen in person by his mental health team for over four months before he died. The coroner noted these "shortcomings in care" but stated they did not amount to gross misconduct.</p>

The deployment has tripled to 7,600 personnel, who are now empowered to apprehend individuals on military-controlled land. A two-star general leads the mission, which aims to stop "got-aways" by deploying troops to remote areas, sidestepping legal prohibitions on military involvement.</p>
