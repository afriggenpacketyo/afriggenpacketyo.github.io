          <p>China is planning to boost its gold production by 5-10% over the next three years, according to a recent action plan released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This initiative involves using new mining technologies and digging deeper to access gold reserves, driven by soaring demand amid geopolitical tensions. The ministry emphasizes that gold is a strategic mineral resource vital for maintaining national industrial and financial security, with the goal of promoting high-quality development and safety in the gold industry. China has been the world's top gold consumer for 12 years, producing 377.24 tonnes last year, making it the largest producer globally for 18 years. Optimism is high as China is attempting to take control of their gold production, but geopolitical tensions are still a concern.</p>

          <p>German police have initiated a nationwide operation targeting hate speech online, focusing on individuals suspected of inciting hostility and insulting politicians. The investigations primarily target radical right-wing material and unlawful insults, with North Rhine-Westphalia seeing significant police deployments. Authorities are urging the public to report instances of hate speech online, reflecting a growing concern over the rise in such violations. Recent data indicates a substantial increase in hate speech violations, having quadrupled since 2021, prompting the government to take decisive action to combat online extremism and protect public figures. The police are actively seeking out digital arsonists who are hiding behind their phones and computers.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched four individuals into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket as part of the Axiom Space Ax-4 mission, marking the fourth private mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew, including retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, will spend 14 days on the ISS conducting approximately 60 experiments across various scientific disciplines. The mission faced multiple delays due to weather and a leak on the ISS's Zvedzda service module, but NASA confirmed the pressure was stable before giving the go-ahead. This mission signifies the return to human spaceflight for Poland and Hungary after more than 40 years, and utilizes a brand new SpaceX Dragon spacecraft designed for transporting civil and commercial astronauts to low-Earth orbit. The launch represents the 18th time SpaceX has launched humans into orbit.</p>

          <p>An intense heat wave has struck the eastern United States, causing record-high temperatures and affecting millions of people. A "heat dome" phenomenon has trapped heat and humidity, leading to dangerous conditions in cities like New York, Boston, and Baltimore. Hospitals have reported an increase in heat-related illnesses, and public transportation has faced disruptions. While the National Weather Service predicts some relief by the weekend, utilities are urging customers to conserve power, and electronics stores have seen a surge in air conditioner and fan sales as residents try to cope with the extreme temperatures.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged countries to collaborate on trade despite rising tariffs and other barriers, speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China. Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and called on all parties to avoid turning trade into political or security issues. He noted that engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order, encouraging countries to stay on the right path. Li did not specifically address U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict, but his comments reflect China's desire for continued economic cooperation and multilateralism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's unpredictable approach to foreign policy is causing uncertainty among European democracies at the NATO summit in The Hague. Trump's disdain for European reliance on the Pentagon and his skepticism about defending the continent are creating tensions. While NATO members pledge to increase defense spending, Trump's commitment to the alliance's mutual defense clause remains uncertain. The war in the Middle East further exacerbates the situation, as European leaders struggle to coordinate defense against external threats amid Trump's volatile leadership.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that a global interconnected solar-wind energy system could meet the world's energy demands by 2050, producing three times the power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers propose a network drawing on regions with abundant renewable energy potential to provide energy across continents. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes. The study highlights the potential of solar and wind resources to vastly surpass human demand, but it acknowledges the need to navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises.</p>

The court awarded her damages of A$70,000, and the ABC apologized for its handling of the matter.
