          <p>A deadly storm system brought tornadoes and flash flooding to the Midwest and South, resulting in at least 20 fatalities across 10 states. The severe weather caused widespread destruction, including damage to homes and infrastructure, and is expected to continue, with forecasters predicting rising waterways for days. Interstate commerce is also affected, with potential shipping and supply chain delays due to flooding in major cargo hubs. The National Weather Service is facing staffing challenges amidst the crisis, and officials are warning residents to remain vigilant as the risk of flash flooding and tornadoes persists. The situation is dire, with some comparing the flooding to catastrophic events of the past.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his sweeping tariffs on imports, stating they are necessary 'medicine' to fix the economy, despite causing shockwaves in global stock markets. Top officials downplayed recession fears, asserting the tariffs would be implemented as planned. However, Asian markets plunged following Trump's comments, and JP Morgan predicted a 60% chance of a US and global recession. Trump claimed European and Asian countries are eager to negotiate deals, while his administration defended the tariffs, arguing they create leverage for the US to address trade barriers.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Democrats are criticizing President Trump for spending the weekend golfing while markets tumbled due to his sweeping tariffs. They argue that his actions demonstrate a lack of concern for Americans' financial anxieties. Democratic Senator Adam Schiff stated that the image of Trump golfing while people's retirement savings are in flames may be the most enduring of his presidency. Other Democrats, including Rep. Eric Swalwell and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, also condemned Trump's policies and his time on the golf course.</p>

          <p>US oil prices dropped below $60 a barrel on Sunday due to fears that President Trump's global tariffs would trigger a recession. Futures tied to US West Texas Intermediate crude fell more than 3% to $59.78. The move comes after back-to-back 6% declines last week. Worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, which could lead to a slowdown in economic activity that would ultimately hurt demand for oil.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations for car manufacturers ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles, aiming to protect jobs amid new US tariffs. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced more flexible rules to help firms transition to electric vehicle production. This includes reducing the non-compliance fine for manufacturers from £15,000 to £12,000 and allowing smaller firms to continue producing petrol cars beyond 2030. The changes are intended to support the British car industry amid potential challenges from US tariffs and the shift to electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin fell below $78,000 as investors braced for increased financial market volatility following a decline in U.S. equities due to President Trump's global tariffs. The cryptocurrency, typically seen as a leading indicator of market sentiment, traded lower after holding steady earlier in the week. Other cryptocurrencies also experienced significant losses. The downturn triggered a wave of long liquidations, as traders betting on a price increase were forced to sell assets to cover losses.</p>

Actors, crew members, and politicians attended the rally, calling for targeted incentives and measures to combat runaway production. The campaign, formed after devastating wildfires, urges proposals such as removing tax incentive caps and lowering film permit fees. Despite the end of Hollywood labor strikes, production has yet to recover, with filming in Los Angeles dropping 30% over the past five years.</p>

Elon Musk is reported to have advised against Trump's tariff order. The NHS's new plan to tackle the health crisis through door-to-door medics is also featured.</p>
