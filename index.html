          <p>Elias Morgan, an armed robber, has been sentenced to a minimum of 45 years in prison for the murder of Lenny Scott, a former prison officer. The killing was an act of revenge planned for four years after Scott lawfully confiscated a mobile phone from Morgan's cell, which exposed Morgan's illicit relationship with a female officer. Morgan shot the father-of-three six times outside a gym in Skelmersdale, an act the police described as a "cold-blooded execution." The judge confirmed the motive was a revenge killing for Scott performing his duties with integrity.</p>

          <p>Actor and producer Issa Rae is executive producing a new two-part HBO documentary titled "Seen and Heard: The History of Black Television." The series examines the evolution of Black representation on TV, highlighting how Black creators have revolutionized the industry while facing significant challenges. Rae discusses how seeing people who looked like her on television in the 90s was essential to her own career, but notes a cyclical disappearance and reemergence of Black shows. The documentary emphasizes the importance of representation both on-screen and behind the camera for authentic storytelling.</p>

          <p>A federal court in California has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and U.S. Marines in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement purposes. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer issued an injunction blocking the administration from using military troops for civilian law enforcement tasks like arrests or crowd control in the state. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by California Governor Gavin Newsom after troops were sent to quell protests related to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have charged three Sydney dockworkers after discovering approximately 1,116 pounds of cocaine hidden within a shipping container. The drugs, with an estimated street value of over $107 million, were concealed behind a false wall in the container which had arrived from Europe. The arrests are part of a broader investigation targeting "trusted insiders" who use their positions to facilitate drug smuggling for organized crime. Two of the men face potential life sentences for importing a commercial quantity of a controlled drug.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, has arrived in Beijing to attend a major military parade. The event marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of World War II and will be hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Kim's attendance, a rare overseas trip for the reclusive leader, signifies strengthening ties between North Korea and China. The visit is notable as it is the first time a North Korean leader has attended a Chinese military parade since 1959.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated his belief that the company's humanoid robot, Optimus, will eventually account for approximately 80% of Tesla's total value. This prediction doubles down on his previous claim that Optimus could turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company. As Tesla faces a sales slump in its electric vehicle division, Musk is shifting investor focus towards the company's future in artificial intelligence, including robotaxis and humanoid robots. However, Tesla is currently behind competitors in key markets and faces growing competition in humanoid robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines the process and difficulty of qualifying for a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments. While generally easier to obtain than traditional mortgages, applicants must meet specific federal requirements for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). These include being at least 62, using the property as a primary residence, having sufficient home equity, and passing a financial assessment to ensure they can cover taxes and insurance. Mandatory counseling is also required to ensure borrowers understand the loan's implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sparked controversy by stating that plans for deploying European troops to Ukraine for post-conflict security were "pretty precise." Her comments received swift backlash from member states, including Germany, whose defense minister noted that such matters should not be discussed publicly before negotiations. Experts suggest her remarks were likely a political signal of support for Eastern European nations, but also inaccurate, as concrete details of any deployment remain unclear. The final shape of any such plan would depend heavily on a future peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In his "Morning Meeting" segment, CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed reluctance to buy into the market during a significant sell-off to start September. He cited ongoing tariff issues, geopolitical factors, and strong economic numbers that might influence the Federal Reserve as reasons for caution. Separately, Cramer noted positive news for Starbucks, highlighting a memo from CEO Brian Niccol that reported a record-breaking sales week following its fall product launch. He suggested that despite potential margin pressures, the high sales volume indicates the company's turnaround plan is working. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Constellation Brands, the maker of Modelo and Corona beer, fell about 6% after the company significantly lowered its financial outlook for the fiscal year. The company cited a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand, particularly noting a decline in purchasing from Hispanic consumers. Constellation now anticipates organic net sales will fall by 4% to 6%, a sharp reversal from its previous guidance. The brewer attributed the pullback among Hispanic consumers to concerns over immigration policies and potential job losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details how consumers struggling with record-high credit card debt can qualify for forbearance, a temporary pause or reduction in payments. To be approved, applicants generally need to demonstrate legitimate financial hardship, such as a job loss, a reduction in income, or a major unexpected expense. A history of reliable payments before the hardship can also improve the chances of approval from the credit card issuer. For those who don't qualify, the article suggests alternatives like debt consolidation or other hardship programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis piece examines the deepening cooperation between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, a group sometimes referred to as the "axis of upheaval." These autocratic nations are increasingly united by their shared opposition to the U.S.-led global order, a trend accelerated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While they lack a common ideology, they share a belief in state-based rights over individual rights and a vision of regional spheres of influence. The article questions the durability of this alliance and considers how a new U.S. administration might approach this bloc of adversaries.</p>

In a social media post, he suggested federal intervention is needed, similar to actions taken in Washington, D.C. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and other local Democratic officials have strongly rejected the idea of sending National Guard troops, calling such a move "un-American" and an "invasion."

          <p>Bitcoin saw a modest price increase on Tuesday, reclaiming the $111,000 level even as the broader stock market experienced a sell-off. The move coincided with spot gold surging to a new record high above $3,500 per ounce, reaffirming its traditional safe-haven status. Market analysts note that while Bitcoin benefits from some of the same geopolitical and economic uncertainty driving gold, its performance has been somewhat dampened by a rotation of capital into other cryptocurrencies. The market shows a desire for both safety and yield, with crypto increasingly competing with traditional assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sting is being sued by his former bandmates from The Police, guitarist Andy Summers and drummer Stewart Copeland, over allegations of unpaid royalties. The lawsuit, filed in the High Court, claims they have been underpaid for their contributions to the band's hit songs from 1977 to 1984. Summers and Copeland argue that an oral agreement to share publishing income was later formalized in contracts, entitling them to a share of both performance and mechanical royalties. Sting's legal team denies the claims, calling them "illegitimate" and arguing a 2016 agreement prevents such disputes.</p>
