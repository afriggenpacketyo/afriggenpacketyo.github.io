          <p>A report from the Royal United Services Institute reveals a significant increase in U.K. vehicle thefts, driven by organized criminal gangs using sophisticated technology. These groups can steal and ship common car models like the Ford Fiesta out of the country within 24 hours. The surge in thefts has cost the British economy approximately £1.77 billion annually and contributed to a sharp rise in car insurance premiums. The report highlights vulnerabilities in U.K. ports and the low-risk, high-reward nature of this international crime. (not investment advice)</p>

Another victim, who protected his family when Monzo broke into their home, also shared his traumatic experience, crediting the police and NHS with saving his life.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a high-resolution digital model of an early-stage human embryo, providing a powerful new tool for understanding organ formation. The research, published in the journal Cell, maps the intricate process where a single fertilized egg develops into hundreds of cell types. This digital embryo aims to decode the secrets of early life and identify why developmental defects occur. Researchers believe this breakthrough will be crucial for studying how abnormalities during this stage can lead to diseases later in life, advancing developmental biology.</p>

          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law set to restrict public benefits for undocumented immigrants, including access to life-saving HIV/AIDS medication. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a doctor and four patients, argues the law is unconstitutionally vague and contradicts federal statutes. It raises concerns that withdrawing treatment from HIV patients will not only harm their health but also increase public health risks by raising transmission rates. The law, effective July 1, appears to be the first of its kind limiting public health benefits since a similar federal push.</p>

This marks the country's first execution since July 2022. Shiraishi, 34, used social media to lure victims who had expressed suicidal thoughts, and was also convicted of sexual assault. The execution occurs amid renewed debate over Japan's use of capital punishment, particularly following the recent acquittal of a man who spent over four decades on death row.

This major concession follows pressure from over 100 backbenchers who threatened to vote against the legislation.

One of the couples killed in the crash leaves behind a baby daughter.

          <p>Tokyo stocks experienced a sharp rally on Friday, with the Nikkei 225 index climbing above the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months. The surge was driven by easing investor concerns over potential U.S. tariffs, following a White House announcement that President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on the duties. The market was also buoyed by gains in the U.S. tech sector, which boosted heavyweight semiconductor stocks, and by reduced geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The positive sentiment led to a weakening of the yen as a safe-haven asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately acquiring 6-foot-6 wing Adou Thiero from Arkansas with the 36th pick. To secure the pick, the Lakers traded their 55th pick and cash to the Bulls for pick 45, then sent that pick and more cash to the Timberwolves. Thiero is described as a "super athletic wing" who can provide athleticism alongside Luka Dončić, though he needs to improve his shooting. In other team news, guard Austin Reaves reportedly declined a four-year, $89 million maximum contract extension offer.</p>
