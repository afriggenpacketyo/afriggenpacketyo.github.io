          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network defamed him. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, centers on comments made by host Jesse Watters, who claimed Newsom lied about a phone call with former President Donald Trump. Newsom's complaint accuses Fox News of intentionally distorting facts to support Trump and damage the governor's reputation. The governor has offered to drop the suit in exchange for a retraction and an on-air apology from the network.</p>

          <p>Researchers are revisiting phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses viruses called bacteriophages to kill harmful bacteria. With antibiotic resistance becoming a "silent pandemic," scientists see potential in these highly specific viruses to treat infections, including superbugs. A BBC correspondent participated in a project, successfully finding a phage in his toilet that killed a patient's persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. While regulatory pathways are still being developed, phage therapy is gaining traction as a vital alternative to failing antibiotics.</p>

She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from classmates who wished they had reached out sooner.

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan found the order targeting Susman Godfrey to be unconstitutional, calling it a violation of the firm's First and Fifth Amendment rights. The series of executive orders sought to penalize firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and ending government contracts, actions judges have described as an assault on the legal system.</p>

          <p>The UK's new Labour government performed a major reversal on its plan to cut disability benefits after facing a significant rebellion from its own MPs. The proposed cuts to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) were intended to generate short-term savings to meet self-imposed borrowing rules. However, critics argued the move prioritized budget math over a necessary long-term strategy to help people with health issues return to the workforce. The U-turn has created a £3 billion budget gap and raised concerns about the government's ability to enact its policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to watch for the upcoming labor report and earnings from alcohol giant Constellation Brands. He noted that weak manufacturing data could pressure the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Cramer expressed pessimism about Constellation Brands, suggesting the company is struggling due to the rise of weight-loss drugs, a consumer shift toward cannabis, and the impact of U.S. immigration policy on its Hispanic customer base. He anticipates the company will report disappointing results. (not investment advice)</p>

Hazlewood was instrumental, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the West Indies' top order.

          <p>The California legislature has approved a measure to increase the annual tax incentives for film and television production from $330 million to $750 million. This significant boost, advocated by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to reverse the trend of productions leaving California for other locations with more generous financial incentives. The state has lost thousands of entertainment industry jobs in recent years, and Hollywood unions have praised the move as a crucial step to bring production back home. The measure is part of a broader effort to ensure California remains the center of the entertainment world.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a dramatic and dangerous expansion of presidential power.

The author contends that this creates a chaotic system where Americans' rights depend on their location and the status of local litigation. The decision is described as an "existential threat to the rule of law" that gives the president unchecked, arbitrary power.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both closed at all-time record highs, continuing a strong surge in the stock market. Investors largely shrugged off concerns about new tariffs and geopolitical conflict, focusing instead on continued economic growth and a dialed-back tariff posture from the administration. The S&P 500 has soared more than 20% since a low in April, reflecting renewed market confidence. The rally occurred despite a brief dip after President Trump announced an end to trade talks with Canada. (not investment advice)</p>
