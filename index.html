          <p>A man allegedly drove his car into a crowd outside an East Hollywood music venue, injuring at least 30 people, seven of them critically. The incident occurred after the driver was reportedly ejected from the nightclub for being disruptive. After the vehicle crashed, bystanders pulled the driver from the car and began to assault him, during which another individual shot the driver. The suspected shooter fled the scene and remains at large, while the driver was hospitalized and will face assault charges.</p>

          <p>English golfer John Parry made the first hole-in-one of this year's Open Championship during the third round at Royal Portrush. The 38-year-old used an 8-iron to ace the 192-yard 13th hole, marking what he estimated to be the 10th hole-in-one of his career, but calling this one "definitely the best." This was the 31st hole-in-one recorded at The Open since 1981. The spectacular shot contributed to Parry's strong round of four-under-par 67, leaving him at 3-under for the tournament.</p>

The activists connect with other Gen Z individuals by discussing shared anxieties around social media's superficiality and the search for authentic relationships. Rather than focusing on abstinence, they frame chastity as a countercultural movement about self-worth and resisting a performative, transactional dating culture. The piece reflects on whether this approach can resonate in an era of a 'sex recession' and widespread secularism, and the potential pitfalls of a worldview centered on avoiding emotional risk.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has revoked the visas of eight of Brazil's eleven Supreme Court judges, escalating a campaign in support of former president Jair Bolsonaro. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets the judge leading the investigation into Bolsonaro's alleged coup attempt, Alexandre de Moraes, and his allies on the court. This action follows President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the visa cancellations as unacceptable interference in his country's judicial system and an affront to national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The second-quarter earnings season has started with mixed but generally supportive results, indicating many companies are managing the current economic climate. Strong earnings and moderating inflation helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq post weekly gains, despite concerns over potential new tariffs. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs reported strong results, while Wells Fargo and BlackRock saw initial stock drops before recovering as investors looked past headline numbers. The reports suggest that while challenges remain, underlying business fundamentals for many key companies appear resilient. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that releasing grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases would not be enough for "troublemakers and radical left lunatics." His comments come after the Department of Justice, at Trump's request, asked federal judges to unseal the testimonies amid growing public pressure. Trump's social media post suggests he believes critics will continue demanding more regardless of what is released. The move follows a defamation lawsuit Trump filed against Rupert Murdoch over a Wall Street Journal article concerning a letter allegedly sent to Epstein.</p>

          <p>Economists are evaluating the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which have been in place for over 100 days. The tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue, potentially exceeding $300 billion by the end of 2025, and have prompted some companies to announce new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, critics caution that these investment promises are long-term and may not materialize, while the tariffs have begun to modestly increase consumer prices on some imported goods.

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway argues that "follow your passion" is the worst career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. He suggests that true success comes from identifying what you are good at, finding where that skill can be profitable, and persevering through rejection. Galloway's own journey involved pivoting from an unsuccessful attempt at professional sports to a lucrative career in marketing and entrepreneurship. The article echoes this sentiment with advice from Mastercard's CEO, who recommends finding the intersection of one's passion, skills, and market needs.</p>

          <p>This article explores the resurgence of tanning, linking it to a broader ideology of rejecting mainstream health guidance, particularly within circles aligned with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. The piece notes the pro-sun and anti-sunscreen views of figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and surgeon general nominee Casey Means, which align with alternative-health conspiracies. This trend coincides with a pop-culture comeback for tans, despite well-established risks of skin cancer. A tan is increasingly seen not just as an aesthetic choice but as an act of defiance against the scientific establishment.</p>

This restructuring, which also includes laying off nearly 23% of the EPA's workforce, or over 3,700 employees, is part of a plan to downsize the federal government. Critics and union leaders warn that dismantling the ORD will devastate the scientific foundation for protecting public health and the environment.

The strikes hit fortified uranium enrichment sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, which are crucial to Iran's nuclear program. While these sites do not have active reactors, experts warn of the potential for leakage of toxic uranium hexafluoride gas, which can form highly corrosive and deadly acid. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported no increase in regional radiation, but the fate of Iran's existing stockpile of enriched uranium is unknown.</p>
