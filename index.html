          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas have resulted in at least 13 fatalities, with rescue operations underway for those stranded by the rapidly rising waters of the Guadalupe River. First responders are utilizing helicopters, drones, and rescue swimmers to locate and save individuals, including children, who climbed trees to escape the deluge. A significant focus of the search is on Camp Mystic, a local summer camp where more than 20 of its 750 campers remain unaccounted for. Officials are urging caution, clarifying that being unaccounted for does not confirm they are lost.</p>

          <p>Merit Street Media, the media company launched by television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection less than two years after its ambitious launch. The filing in a Texas court comes after two rounds of significant layoffs and reports assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. The company has also initiated a lawsuit against its distribution partner, Trinity Broadcasting Network, for allegedly failing to fulfill foundational commitments critical for the network's viability. The network aimed to provide an alternative to what it termed 'woke' culture.</p>

This decision makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The move follows significant criminal damage attributed to the group, though Palestine Action's lawyers argued the ban is an 'authoritarian abuse' of power against a non-violent civil disobedience group that uses direct action tactics like spraying paint.</p>

The top 1% will see an average tax cut of about $66,000, with those in states like Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas receiving cuts exceeding $100,000. The report attributes this to the bill's structure, which extends tax cuts, favors business owners, and raises the SALT deduction cap, providing maximum benefit to high earners in states without personal income taxes.

          <h2>Varying State Names for Medicaid Could Cause Confusion Amid Coverage Changes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health advocates and experts are raising concerns that the wide variety of names for Medicaid programs across different states could lead to significant confusion for beneficiaries. With recent policy changes affecting eligibility, there is a risk that many people may not realize they are losing their health coverage until it is too late. The lack of a uniform name for the government health insurance program, which is known by names like 'MassHealth' in Massachusetts or 'Medi-Cal' in California, complicates communication about critical coverage updates.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signaled that a 60-day ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, with Hamas delivering what it called a 'positive' response to mediators. However, the group is reportedly seeking guarantees for a permanent end to the war, which Israel has previously rejected. Despite the diplomatic progress, Israeli military operations intensified across Gaza, killing at least 138 Palestinians over two days. This highlights the fragile nature of the negotiations and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the enclave.</p>

The order came just hours after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with the removal. The case, involving men with almost no ties to the war-torn nation, was transferred to another judge in Boston who had previously ruled on the matter, as lawyers argue the men could face perilous conditions if deported.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing criticism for using the term 'shylocks' during a speech in Iowa while discussing lenders. The word, which references a greedy Jewish moneylender character from Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice,' is widely considered an offensive antisemitic trope. When questioned, the president claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations. The Anti-Defamation League called the remark 'very troubling and irresponsible,' and Democratic Representative Dan Goldman described it as 'blatant and vile antisemitism.'</p>

This has sparked speculation that a similar PHEV powertrain could also be offered for the Tacoma, its American mid-size equivalent. While no technical details are available, this move would align with Toyota's stated goal of significantly increasing its PHEV sales in the U.S. market as it continues to prioritize hybrid technology over a full-EV approach.</p>

          <p>As part of the new spending package, a provision creates a temporary federal income tax deduction for workers who rely on tips, a key promise from President Trump. The measure allows eligible workers, such as restaurant staff and hairdressers, to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income, though they will still owe payroll and state taxes. Critics argue the temporary break, which expires in 2028, primarily helps higher-earning tipped workers and does not benefit the lowest earners who have no federal tax liability to begin with.
