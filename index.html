            <p>Lucy Edwards, a blind content creator with Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP), is considering IVF with pre-implantation genetic testing to avoid passing the condition, which caused her blindness, to her children. IP affects the X chromosome and can be more severe in males, leading to miscarriages or severe brain damage. Edwards acknowledges the ethical debate surrounding designer babies but feels responsible for giving her child the healthiest start possible. She has faced both positive and negative reactions to her decision, particularly from audiences unfamiliar with her disability advocacy.</p>

            <p>At least 56 people have been killed in attacks in Nigeria's Benue state, with the governor attributing the violence to suspected herdsmen amidst rising intercommunal clashes. The attacks, part of a larger pattern of violence in Nigeria's Middle Belt, are often rooted in disputes between nomadic herders and settled farmers over land use, exacerbated by climate change. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to protect communities from these attacks, which often take on religious dimensions with Christian farmers and Muslim Fulani herders involved.</p>

            <p>The remaining hereditary peers in the UK's House of Lords are facing the prospect of being removed from Parliament as the government pushes forward with a bill to end their roles. Some peers express acceptance of their impending departure, while others defend the value of hereditary peers in providing a long-term perspective on issues. A Liberal Democrat peer supports the removal but believes it's merely a 'sticking plaster' and that the House of Lords needs more fundamental reform to gain legitimacy.

            <p>A woman in Spain, assessed as at 'medium' risk by a police algorithm called VioGén after reporting threats from her ex-partner, was later murdered.

            <p>An Indonesian student in Minnesota was detained by ICE after his student visa was secretly revoked. His attorney claims the revocation was based on a misdemeanor conviction for graffiti, which is not a deportable offense. The student is married to a U.S. citizen and has a pending green card application. His wife and child are distraught, and he has been fired from his job while in detention. The case is part of a wave of reports of student visas being revoked under the Trump administration.</p>

Huang carefully selects and ties the best young fruits to branches, ensuring they don't fall abruptly when they ripen in the summer.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered a pause in the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members being held in detention. The challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the Venezuelans detained in north Texas had been given notices about their imminent deportation in English, despite one detainee only speaking Spanish. The White House called challenges to using the law for mass deportations "meritless litigation". The Alien Enemies Act was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent were imprisoned without trial and thousands sent to internment camps.</p>
