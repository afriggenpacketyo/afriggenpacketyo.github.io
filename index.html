          <p>Nvidia's stock value saw a surge, briefly pushing its market capitalization beyond the $4 trillion threshold for the first time in history. This milestone solidifies its position as the world's most valuable company, having previously surpassed tech giants Microsoft and Apple. The company's rapid growth is fueled by the immense demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for powering the ongoing generative AI boom. Despite challenges like U.S. export restrictions impacting sales to China, investor confidence in Nvidia's dominance in the AI hardware market remains strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose significant new tariffs on up to 20 countries, with the new duties set to take effect by August 1. The president revealed the policy through a series of letters posted on social media, targeting nations including Japan, South Korea, and others across Asia and Europe. The proposed tariff rates vary, reaching as high as 40% for countries like Myanmar and Laos, sparking concerns among economists. Critics warn that these wide-ranging tariffs could reignite inflation and disrupt global trade, while the administration maintains they are necessary for fair trade and to boost American manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who previously served as President Joe Biden's White House physician, declined to answer questions during a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee. He cited both physician-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Republican-led committee had subpoenaed Dr. O'Connor as part of an investigation into President Biden's mental fitness and the alleged use of an autopen while in office. GOP Chairman James Comer called the move unprecedented and suggested it fuels speculation of a cover-up, vowing that the committee's investigation will continue with other witnesses.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has recommended loosening a cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move aimed at helping more first-time buyers enter the property market. The new guidance would allow individual lenders to issue a higher percentage of their new mortgages with loan-to-income ratios exceeding 4.5. This change could result in up to 36,000 new mortgages annually, providing a boost to the housing market and wider economy. The decision comes as part of a government push for economic growth, though the Bank's report also noted that millions of existing mortgage holders still face increased monthly payments as their fixed-rate deals expire.

          <p>Doctors and healthcare professionals are raising alarms that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in medical facilities is deterring some undocumented immigrants from seeking necessary care. While ICE agents are sometimes present to bring detainees for medical clearance, their appearance has reportedly created an atmosphere of fear. Medical experts warn that delaying treatment for serious conditions like heart attacks or strokes can have severe consequences. Some hospitals have begun providing staff with guidance on how to handle encounters with ICE to protect patient privacy and rights, highlighting a growing tension between immigration enforcement and public health access.</p>

However, her authority was widely seen as limited, with Musk remaining the ultimate decision-maker and public face of the company. Yaccarino's exit coincides with recent controversies, including the platform's AI chatbot, Grok, generating antisemitic content, adding to the ongoing instability at the tech firm.</p>

State Superintendent Ryan Walters stated the goal is to prevent "leftist propaganda" in classrooms and raise a "generation of patriots."

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck after responding to a call about a suspicious person outside an ICE detention facility late on the Fourth of July.

Federal sources indicate that a group of masked individuals had vandalized the facility and may have launched fireworks to lure law enforcement to the scene.</p>

The return of the Snack Wrap, which was discontinued in 2016, follows a long-running social media campaign from fans demanding its comeback.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly lashed out at Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, telling him to "Shut up" in a post on X. The comment followed Ives' recommendation that the Tesla board should curb Musk's political activities, including his recent announcement of a new political party. Ives had argued in a research note that Musk's focus on politics creates unnecessary reputational risk for Tesla at a critical time for the company. The public clash highlights the ongoing tension between Musk's controversial public persona and the concerns of investors about its impact on the electric vehicle maker's brand and stock performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a period of underperformance, industrial conglomerate Honeywell is seeing a resurgence in investor confidence, prompting some analysts to raise their price targets for the company's stock. The positive shift is attributed to the company's strategy of simplifying its business, making strategic acquisitions, and a potential for strong earnings momentum. Analysts note that after setting conservative guidance for the year, Honeywell is well-positioned to beat expectations in upcoming quarters. This renewed optimism suggests the company's efforts to navigate a complex tariff environment and streamline operations are beginning to pay off. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed they sank a Greek-operated vessel, the Eternity C, in a missile and unmanned vessel attack in the Red Sea that resulted in multiple fatalities. The group stated the attack was in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, alleging the ship was heading to Israel. This assault marks a serious escalation in the region, with four crew members confirmed dead and fifteen still missing from the sunken ship. The attack is the second claimed by the Houthis in a week, renewing concerns about the security of the vital maritime trade route and the ongoing threat the Iran-backed rebels pose to international shipping.</p>

          <p>Social media influencer and gymnast Olivia "Livvy" Dunne was denied the purchase of a $1.6-million Manhattan apartment once owned by baseball legend Babe Ruth. Dunne revealed in a TikTok video that after having her all-cash offer accepted, the building's co-op board rejected her application just before she was scheduled to receive the keys. The listing agent confirmed the rejection but provided no reason, a common practice for co-op boards. Dunne speculated that the board may have been wary of a public figure moving in, turning her dream of owning a piece of sports history into a frustrating lesson on the opaque nature of New York co-op approvals.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed one of the largest air attacks of the war, firing nearly 750 drones and missiles at targets in western Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian officials reported that their air defense systems successfully downed the vast majority of the projectiles, though the assault represents a significant escalation. The attack came as the U.S. announced it was reversing a pause on delivering Patriot missile systems to Kyiv, with President Trump signaling a tougher stance on Russia's aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack and called for more "biting" sanctions against Moscow's energy sector to cripple its war funding.</p>
