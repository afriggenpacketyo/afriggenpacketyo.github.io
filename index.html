            <p>The Dominican Republic began burying victims of a nightclub roof collapse that killed 221 people, including a merengue icon and former baseball players, after authorities called off the search.

            <p>In a prisoner swap arranged by the CIA and FSB, Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national, who was imprisoned for treason after donating a small sum to a Ukrainian humanitarian group.

The exchange, which took place in Abu Dhabi, highlights ongoing efforts to maintain communication between the U.S. and Russia despite strained relations, and also underscores the risk of traveling to Russia as an American citizen.</p>

            <p>Chinese exporters are struggling to cope with soaring U.S. tariffs, leading to increased prices for American consumers and prompting businesses to diversify operations or halt shipments. The tariffs, which have climbed from 10% to 125% in recent months, threaten to cut off most trade between the two countries. Some U.S. companies are exploring alternative suppliers in countries like Vietnam, while China is focusing on boosting domestic sales to offset the impact. The escalating trade tensions have also led to lowered GDP forecasts for China and concerns about employment in export-oriented industries. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Danish shoppers are boycotting U.S. products in protest of President Trump's stance on Greenland and trade tariffs. Salling Group, a major grocery chain, has introduced labels to identify European-owned brands, making it easier for consumers to avoid American goods. This boycott reflects a broader trend in Europe, with consumers seeking regionally made products. This shift in consumer sentiment extends to travel, with fewer travelers booking trips to the U.S. amid unfavorable currency fluctuations and high-profile detainments of visa-holders.</p>

            <p>President Trump's initial plan to impose sweeping tariffs has been partially reversed, leading to questions about the progress of his trade objectives. While some countries are engaging in trade negotiations, the instability created by the on-again, off-again tariff moves makes it difficult for businesses to invest. Despite this uncertainty, Trump seems determined to confront China over trade imbalances, even if it risks alienating allies. The proposed tariffs could generate significant revenue, but they also risk raising prices for U.S. consumers.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's erratic tariff policies have created an opportunity for Europe to assert itself as a stable alternative to the U.S. The EU's ability to act swiftly and decisively, particularly in the face of Trump's animosity, is key to its success. Europe should prioritize energy independence by replacing fossil fuels with renewables, boosting its economy and strengthening its position on the global stage. The situation can be used to accelerate green re-industrialization and challenge the dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man wrongly deported to a jail in El Salvador. The administration conceded that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was an administrative error. Despite the ruling, the Supreme Court also directed the lower court to clarify its initial order, recognizing the president's authority in foreign affairs. The government alleges Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyer denies.</p>

            <p>Doctors and nurses are speaking out against common health "lies" and misconceptions, such as the belief that getting cold or wet causes a cold or that sugar makes kids hyper. They are emphasizing that antibiotics do not cure viral infections and that the color of mucus doesn't necessarily indicate a bacterial infection. The medical professionals are also addressing misconceptions about ER wait times, pain levels, and the role of insurance companies, aiming to educate the public on accurate health information.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has terminated $5.1 billion in IT and consulting contracts with firms like Accenture and Deloitte, deeming them "wasteful spending." The cuts target contracts for consulting services and re-selling third-party IT services. The savings will be reallocated to critical priorities such as reviving the warrior ethos and rebuilding the military. Hegseth thanked Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for helping to identify the wasteful spending.</p>

Khalil's lawyers are criticizing the memo and plan to request to depose Rubio in court. The case could set a precedent for silencing critics and removing them from the country.</p>

Almost 600,000 people across the UK took part in The Big Garden Birdwatch this year, counting more than nine million birds.</p>

The strike, the third since President Javier Milei took office, protests austerity measures implemented to tackle hyperinflation. While inflation has decreased, unions argue that vulnerable populations, including pensioners and low-paid workers, are disproportionately affected by the cuts. The strike follows recent protests by pensioners that have resulted in clashes with police.</p>
