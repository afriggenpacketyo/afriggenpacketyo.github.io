          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. According to prosecutors, Kohberger will plead guilty to four counts of murder in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The agreement brings a sense of relief to some victims' families who wish to avoid a lengthy trial, while others have expressed fury and a feeling of betrayal over the decision. A plea hearing is expected soon, and if Kohberger does not follow through, the case will proceed to trial as planned.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has confirmed that President Trump's tariff policies are the primary reason the central bank has not lowered interest rates. During a panel discussion, Powell stated that the Fed had to put its plans for easier monetary policy "on hold" after the tariffs were announced. He explained that the levies on foreign goods caused inflation forecasts for the United States to rise significantly. This forced the Fed to maintain its current stance rather than implementing cuts that might have otherwise occurred. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has uncovered a sophisticated North Korean scheme that placed thousands of covert IT workers in unwitting American companies to fund its weapons programs. These workers used stolen or fake identities to secure remote jobs, with their salaries being funneled back to the North Korean government. The operation, which generated millions of dollars, also reportedly gave operatives access to sensitive corporate and military data. U.S. authorities have announced criminal charges against several individuals, including a U.S. national, for their roles in facilitating the multi-year fraud.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are encountering significant obstacles in their effort to pass a massive tax and spending bill, a key component of President Trump's second-term agenda. With at least four Republican senators expressing opposition, the party lacks the necessary votes to pass the legislation, forcing leadership into prolonged negotiations. The bill, which extends Trump's first-term tax cuts and proposes spending cuts to social programs, has stalled after a lengthy session of amendment debates. President Trump has acknowledged that his initial July 4th deadline for the bill's passage is now unlikely to be met. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab indicates that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would disproportionately benefit high-income households while financially harming the lowest earners. The report finds that the bottom 20% of households would see their annual income decrease by about $700, whereas the top 20% would gain an average of $5,700. This disparity is primarily attributed to sharp cuts in programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which would outweigh the modest tax relief for lower-income families. The bill's central feature is the extension of the 2017 tax cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

The prolonged process highlights the deep divisions over the legislation and the tenuous Republican majority, with Vice President JD Vance on standby for a potential tie-breaking vote.

          <p>For the third consecutive quarter, public companies have acquired more bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a strategic shift in institutional investment. This trend is driven by companies emulating the "MicroStrategy playbook" of holding bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset to enhance shareholder value, a move encouraged by a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. While ETFs still hold a larger total amount of bitcoin, corporate buying is noted for being less sensitive to short-term price fluctuations and more focused on long-term accumulation.

          <p>A former Church of England priest, Christopher Brain, is on trial for allegedly leading a cult and sexually abusing a "staggering" number of women from his congregation in the 1980s and 90s. Prosecutors claim Brain used his progressive "Nine O-Clock Service" to create a controlled group where he dominated and assaulted female members, who were isolated from their families. He is accused of one count of sexual assault and dozens of indecent assault charges involving 13 women. Brain, who denies the charges, maintains that any sexual activity was consensual.</p>

          <p>The U.S. e-commerce sector is facing its most significant disruption in over ten years, largely due to President Trump's tariff policies, according to a new survey from AlixPartners. The data reveals double-digit declines in online purchases across major categories as consumers delay buying or seek domestic alternatives to avoid higher prices. In response to these pressures and rising delivery costs, many retailers are tightening their shipping and return policies, such as by increasing the minimum order value required for free shipping.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the future of Planned Parenthood is in jeopardy following a series of blows from the Trump administration and the Supreme Court. A recent court ruling now allows states to exclude the organization from their Medicaid programs, which could choke off a major funding source for non-abortion services like cancer screenings and contraception for low-income patients. This decision, combined with other administration actions, could force hundreds of clinics to close. The author contends these moves are part of a broader agenda to restrict access not just to abortion but to all healthcare from pro-choice providers.</p>

The mayor argues that the operations are a type of psychological warfare that targets people based on their appearance, disrupting the heavily Latino community.

The potential deal, for at least 100 to 200 new jets, comes as Boeing has not secured a major order from China since 2017 due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and its own reputational setbacks. This shift reflects Beijing's strategy to rely more on European and domestically produced aircraft.

She rejected the restrictive European styles of the era, focusing instead on freedom of movement and ease of wear.

While factors like smartphones are often blamed, experts point to more significant barriers, such as increased traffic, faster speed limits, and larger vehicles, which make parents fearful for their children's safety.
