          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to secure copper supplies from Africa, a mineral crucial for the global green energy transition. Recognizing copper's importance for electric vehicles and solar power, Chinese companies are heavily investing in mining and processing facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana. This strategic push is partly a response to Western restrictions on critical mineral acquisitions, particularly from Canada. The investments aim to ensure China maintains a stable supply chain for its expanding new energy sector.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer experienced a significant political humiliation after being forced to withdraw key elements of his welfare reform bill following a large-scale rebellion from his own MPs. The government's U-turn on changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) has created a substantial hole in the public finances and weakened the Prime Minister's authority. This chaotic episode has led to widespread criticism within the Labour party, with many questioning the government's competence and direction just weeks after a major election victory.</p>

The authors contend that this move prioritizes corporate interests over citizens and fiscal responsibility, calling for a rejection of the G7 deal in favor of a more equitable UN-led international tax system.
