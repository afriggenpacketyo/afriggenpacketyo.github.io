          <p>The United Nations human rights office has condemned a targeted Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed six journalists, including five from Al Jazeera, calling it a grave breach of international law. Israel claimed one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, was a Hamas operative but has provided limited evidence, a pattern that media rights groups say is common. The attack has drawn international concern, with organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders demanding an independent investigation. This incident brings the total number of journalists killed in the conflict since October 2023 to at least 186, the deadliest period on record.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to federalize the Washington, D.C. police department and deploy the National Guard, declaring a public safety emergency to address what he described as crime and "bedlam." Under this action, Attorney General Pam Bondi will assume command of the city's police force. The administration also plans to remove homeless encampments from public parks as part of a broader effort to "rescue" and "renovate" the capital. The move has been met with criticism, as D.C.

          <p>The U.S. government has brokered an unusual agreement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, requiring them to pay 15% of their revenue from specific AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This revenue-sharing plan, confirmed by the White House, applies to Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were previously restricted. President Trump stated he personally negotiated the deal with Nvidia's CEO, framing it as a benefit for the country. The move comes amid ongoing efforts to balance national security concerns with American companies' ability to compete in the global AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe storms over the weekend caused widespread flash flooding across several Midwestern states, resulting in at least one death in Nebraska and forcing numerous road closures. The Milwaukee area was hit particularly hard, with some parts receiving a record-breaking 14 inches of rain, leading to over 60 water rescues and significant power outages for nearly 18,000 customers. The flooding was severe enough to cancel the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair. As of Monday, floodwaters have begun to subside, and emergency crews are working to restore services and clear debris from the affected areas.</p>

          <p>Norway's ski federation is embroiled in a controversy involving illegally modified ski jumping suits, leading to ethics violation charges against five team members, including two Olympic gold medalists. Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, along with two coaches and a staff member, are accused of equipment manipulation during the March world championships. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation is investigating the claims, which could jeopardize the medals won by the athletes. The head coach and equipment manager have confessed to altering suits, which can provide an aerodynamic advantage, though the accused athletes deny involvement.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a $2 billion investment to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant as part of its new "Universal EV Program" focused on producing more affordable electric vehicles. This initiative, combined with a $3 billion battery park in Michigan, aims to create or secure nearly 4,000 jobs. The first vehicle from this program will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch with a starting price of $30,000. CEO Jim Farley described the strategy as a radical approach to compete with global competitors, particularly from China, and navigate shifting EV policies.</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was among dozens of parliamentarians detained in New Delhi during a protest against alleged electoral malpractice. The demonstrators marched on the Election Commission headquarters, claiming that electoral rolls are being manipulated to favor Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling BJP. The protest was sparked by a large-scale revision of the electoral roll in the state of Bihar, which critics fear could disenfranchise millions, particularly in the Muslim minority community. The government has defended the revision as necessary to remove deceased voters and add new ones, accusing the opposition of creating doubt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Department of Justice's request to release grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell case, calling the move a potential "diversion" rather than a genuine effort at transparency. Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that unsealing the documents would undermine the secrecy of grand jury proceedings and noted the testimony was redundant to evidence already presented at trial. The request came amid political pressure for more transparency in the Jeffrey Epstein case. While this specific request was denied, legal battles over other related documents, including from an earlier Epstein indictment, are still ongoing.</p>

          <p>A wellness trend dubbed "cowmaxxing" is gaining popularity, promoting the use of cow-based products like beef tallow moisturizer, raw milk, and supplements made from bovine organs and collagen. Proponents, including influencers and some public figures, claim these products offer natural health benefits for skin, gut health, and immunity, often citing an ancestral or unprocessed lifestyle. However, public health experts warn that many claims are unsupported by scientific evidence and that some products, like raw milk, can be dangerous. The trend appears to tap into a growing distrust of conventional science and a desire for products perceived as pure and natural.</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley has directly challenged competitors like BYD and Tesla by announcing a new midsize electric truck with a starting price of $30,000, set to launch in 2027.

Farley acknowledged the intense competition from Chinese automakers and the need to offer affordable vehicles that meet consumer demands. The new truck will feature a smaller, more cost-effective battery and a front trunk, and will even have the capacity to provide backup power for a home.</p>

Companies like Tesla and Rivian anticipate a hit to revenue from the loss of regulatory credit sales, while GM and Ford are leveraging their diverse portfolios of gas and electric vehicles to adapt.

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores with a diverse mix of non-traditional tenants, including churches, entertainment complexes, and popular bookstores. This strategy of subdividing large retail spaces is creating new "cross-shopping" opportunities and transforming malls into community hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people weekly. Industry data shows an increase in mall traffic, driven by these new experiential and community-focused tenants that attract visitors for reasons beyond traditional shopping.</p>
