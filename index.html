          <p>President Trump marked Memorial Day by visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery and delivering remarks. This annual tradition involves the president laying a wreath to honor those who died in battle. Earlier in the day, Trump posted a message on Truth Social wishing a "happy Memorial Day to all," while also targeting political opponents and criticizing immigration policies. The president also proclaimed that the U.S. will designate new holidays to commemorate the end of World War I and World War II in Europe, though Veterans Day already exists on Nov. 11. The solemn occasion is intended to honor those who died in uniform as a result of battle.</p>

          <p>The FBI issued a warning about cybercriminals exploiting old, unpatched routers to power anonymous cybercrime operations. These aging devices, manufactured around 2010 or earlier, no longer receive security updates, making them vulnerable to malware like "TheMoon." Hackers exploit these routers by scanning for devices with remote administration exposed to the internet, using known firmware flaws to run malicious code. The FBI recommends replacing old routers, keeping firmware updated, turning off remote access, using strong passwords, monitoring for strange behavior, and reporting incidents to authorities. Compromised routers can lead to slower connections, exposure to phishing, and potential legal trouble.</p>

The University of Tokyo is considering accepting Harvard students if they are barred from studying in the U.S. Japan has also started revised rice stocks sales to cut prices by early June, and the Osaka expo is changing its no-smoking policy to include two smoking areas. Additionally, Japan Post introduced online 7-digit codes to replace home addresses for online shopping services, while Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control after a deal with Nippon Steel Corp.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed its sporadic eruption, shooting lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash. Lava fountains from the mountain's north vent reached heights of over 1,000 feet, while the south vent saw fountains reaching over 800 feet. Lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera, posing no immediate threat to residential areas. The volcano also released an eruptive plume containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair, prompting caution for residents and visitors due to potential hazards from wind-carried volcanic fragments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Vladimir Putin, calling the escalation of attacks on Ukraine "absolutely crazy." This statement comes as Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the war began. Despite this criticism, Trump also voiced displeasure with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's remarks. The Kremlin downplayed Trump's comments as an emotional outburst, while some European leaders saw the change in tone as a sign that Trump is realizing Putin's lack of commitment to a diplomatic resolution. The article also notes that Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner swap.</p>

          <p>This news analysis suggests that President Trump might envision a world order where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. This idea is reminiscent of 19th-century imperial rule, with Trump potentially seeking to extend U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere through actions like pursuing Greenland and exerting influence in Latin America. While some argue that Trump's actions lack strategic depth, there are signs that his administration is considering a return to spheres of influence, potentially impacting relationships with allies and rivals alike. The article highlights the challenges of establishing such spheres in the modern era.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated the sale of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts to reduce soaring prices, aiming for a retail price of around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This action comes in response to criticism that the government has been ineffective in preventing rice prices from skyrocketing amid inflation. The plan involves releasing 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system to better control prices. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to address high rice price issues, reflecting the government's commitment to quelling public concerns (not investment advice).</p>

Litman suggests that younger leaders are more open to change and challenging established institutions. She advocates for open conversations about retirement and encourages separating work from personhood to improve overall engagement in politics.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, marking the first time in over half a century that the company will charge for checked bags. The change comes as baggage fees have become a significant revenue source for U.S. airlines. The airline has not yet announced the specific fees, but competitors typically charge around $35 to $40 for a first checked bag on domestic flights. Along with the new baggage fees, Southwest is also implementing major changes to its business model, including getting rid of open seating and introducing basic-economy tickets.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker best known for “The Sorrow and the Pity,” has died at the age of 97. His landmark film debunked the idea of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II. The documentary, which interviewed shopkeepers, farmers, and other citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, revealed a more complex picture of collaboration and indifference. Despite facing controversy and a ban from French television for years, "The Sorrow and the Pity" is considered his masterpiece and paved the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France.</p>

The United Nations has heavily criticized the plan, saying it would force further displacement and make "starvation a bargaining chip."

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed dozens, including many sheltering in a school, prompting controversy and concern over humanitarian aid. At least 54 Palestinians were killed, with 35 in a school building housing displaced families. The Israeli military claimed it targeted a militant command center there, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. The strikes are part of a broader Israeli offensive, while a senior Hamas official stated the group agreed to a ceasefire proposal. Cindy McCain highlighted that aid trucks to Gaza are insufficient, as the new aid system faces challenges and resignations.</p>
