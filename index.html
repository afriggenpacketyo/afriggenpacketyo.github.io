          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Surpasses June Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 02:38:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a figure higher than anticipated and the second-highest for that month since records began in 1993. This increase was driven by rising public service spending and a near-doubling of debt interest payments, which overshadowed higher tax revenues. The data intensifies pressure on public finances and fuels speculation about potential tax increases or spending cuts in the upcoming Autumn Budget to align with fiscal targets.

          <p>The UK government is set to announce new financial sanctions targeting people-smuggling gangs, a move described as a world-first. The measures will include asset freezes and travel bans for individuals and companies involved in organizing small boat crossings, such as those supplying fake documents or financing the operations. This policy is a key part of the government's strategy to disrupt criminal networks and stem the flow of illegal immigration across the English Channel, amid rising crossing numbers.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with former leadership rival Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a high-profile frontbench position. Initially anticipated to be minor, the changes are now understood to be a larger shake-up aimed at advancing the party's policy renewal and demonstrating unity. The move signals a new phase in the opposition's strategy to challenge the current Labour government.</p>

          <p>North Korea has announced its intention to build a third 5,000-ton destroyer for its navy, setting a target completion date of October 2026, the anniversary of the ruling party's founding. The pledge was made at a rally where workers were urged to uphold the party's plan for building a powerful military to defend maritime sovereignty. This follows the launch of its first such destroyer in April and the capsizing and subsequent repair of a second one in May.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced 'substantial changes' to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, following a highly critical report from the public inquiry chair. The scandal saw 30,000 people infected with HIV or hepatitis in the 1970s-90s. Changes include allowing payments to be passed through a deceased family member's estate, with the government stating the goal is to restore trust and deliver justice, though victims' groups noted some issues still require further consultation.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. This sharp increase is attributed to high tenant demand and an insufficient supply of available rental properties. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, the high costs are forcing some people to make career decisions based on local rent prices and rely on financial help from family.
