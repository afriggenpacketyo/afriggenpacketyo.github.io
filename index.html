          <h2>BP Shares Surge Following Elliott's Stake Disclosure Amid Strategic Shift</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 04:45:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP's stock experienced a notable increase after activist investor Elliott disclosed a stake exceeding 5% in the company. This move followed BP's strategic adjustment back towards oil investments to reassure investors, reversing its earlier focus on green initiatives. The company had previously reduced its emissions targets, citing the need to meet global energy demands through continued oil and gas investments. This strategic shift has garnered interest in BP's non-core assets, positioning the energy firm as a potential takeover target by industry giants like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron.

          <p>Negotiations are ongoing to resolve a strike by Birmingham bin workers, now in its seventh week, which has led to significant waste accumulation and public health concerns. The strike, involving hundreds of workers, stems from a dispute over pay and jobs, causing suspension of recycling and garden waste collections. While the government urges the union to accept a council offer, Unite seeks written confirmation of promises made by the council. The council reports progress in removing waste, but residents express continued frustration with the ongoing disruption.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London have been scaled down, with key US officials no longer participating.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected any such proposals, asserting that Crimea remains Ukrainian territory.

          <p>Elon Musk plans to reduce his involvement in the US government following a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and sales. This decision comes after Musk led the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge), sparking controversy and boycotts of Tesla cars.

Timms's father provided crucial practical input into the invention, and Timms hopes the device will eventually be used for life, eliminating waiting lists for heart transplants.

The proposal, reportedly made during a meeting with a special envoy, involves Russia relinquishing claims to parts of several regions in exchange for US recognition of its sovereignty over Crimea and Ukraine's exclusion from NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed openness to dialogue after a ceasefire, as representatives from Ukraine, the UK, France, and the US prepare to meet in London.</p>

          <h2>US Births Slightly Increased in 2024, CDC Data Shows</h2>

          <p>The number of births in the US saw a slight increase of 1% in 2024, according to provisional data from the CDC, marking a small shift after a long-term decline. This rise appears largely driven by Hispanic and Asian mothers, while birth rates decreased for Black, American Indian, and white women. Demographers caution against drawing conclusions about a trend, noting continued economic uncertainty and challenges for families. The report does not address the impact of abortion bans, though some research suggests increased birth rates in states with bans.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of international students in the US have had their legal status revoked, leading to court challenges and temporary restraining orders. These students, targeted by the Trump administration, face deportation and academic disruptions. Attorneys argue that the government lacks legal grounds for these revocations, while students describe mental and financial suffering. Some students have successfully had their status temporarily restored, but uncertainty remains as litigation continues.</p>
