          <p>A large wildfire in the Aude region of southern France has led to the death of an elderly woman, with another person reported missing. The blaze, the largest in France this year, has burned over 13,000 hectares, destroying homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. Over 1,800 firefighters are battling the fire, which is fueled by strong winds and hot, dry conditions exacerbated by climate change. Officials warn the fire will be a long-term operation as the region's vulnerability has increased in recent years.</p>

The 52-year-old model explained that she and her husband are using herbal pills containing ingredients like clove and papaya seeds, which she believes are effective against parasites. While Klum is embracing this new routine, health organizations like the Mayo Clinic and Healthline note there is little research to support the effectiveness of such cleanses for treating parasitic infections.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is struggling to disburse billions in allocated funds before the fiscal year ends, due to what current and former officials describe as an "ongoing siege" by the Trump administration. Despite a recent Senate vote to increase its budget, the agency is paralyzed by grant freezes, canceled awards, and staffing shortages, leaving it billions of dollars behind its typical spending schedule. Officials fear that returning unspent funds to the Treasury could justify future budget cuts, effectively crippling the nation's primary public funder of biomedical research.

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose secondary tariffs on any country trading with Russia could have significant global economic repercussions, primarily by affecting energy prices. If the tariffs successfully cut the flow of Russian oil and gas, reduced supply could lead to a spike in inflation. However, experts note that OPEC+ has spare capacity to offset some impact, and Russia may use its "shadow fleet" of tankers to evade sanctions. The policy has already hit India with higher tariffs, which could raise prices for U.S. consumers on goods like iPhones manufactured there. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Americans take on more responsibility for their retirement, certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities are popular low-risk options, but they serve different purposes. CDs offer simplicity and FDIC-insured safety, making them ideal for short-term goals, but their returns may not outpace inflation. Annuities are specifically designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, though they are more complex and less liquid. The best choice depends on an individual's specific needs, risk tolerance, and existing portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite nearly two years of war severely weakening its capabilities, Hamas has continued to pay salaries to approximately 30,000 civil servants in Gaza using a covert, cash-based system. Employees receive a fraction of their pre-war salary every 10 weeks, delivered discreetly and often dangerously by distributors targeted by Israel. A senior Hamas source claims the group stockpiled hundreds of millions of dollars in cash before the war, allowing it to maintain this semblance of governance, though the small payments are causing resentment amid soaring inflation and food shortages.</p>

The White House praised the move as a win for American manufacturing, while analysts suggest the pledge may help Apple receive more favorable treatment regarding ongoing trade disputes and tariffs.

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles, using a rented Penske truck as a "Trojan Horse" to apprehend day laborers.

The raid has revived fears of widespread immigration sweeps, with civil rights groups concerned that it violates a recent court order limiting indiscriminate enforcement and racial profiling.

Revoking the city's "home rule," established in 1973, would be an unprecedented move requiring congressional action and would likely face fierce legal and political challenges.</p>

          <p>A new case before the Supreme Court, NetChoice v. Fitch, questions the extent of First Amendment rights for minors online. The case challenges a Mississippi law that requires social media platforms to get parental consent before allowing a minor to create an account. This follows a recent ruling that contracted free speech rights by upholding age-verification for pornographic sites. The new case will test whether the court will further roll back protections established in a 2011 precedent that limited the government's power to restrict ideas to which children are exposed.</p>
