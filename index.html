          <h2>Germany Considers Increasing Defense Spending to Meet NATO Target</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's foreign minister indicated that Berlin is prepared to meet President Trump's demand for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP. Currently, NATO members are committed to spending at least 2% of GDP on military expenditure, a target that many countries still do not meet. Germany currently spends just over 2% of its GDP on defense, and Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that each additional percentage point would mean further annual expenditure of €45 billion. Some countries consider the 5% target unrealistic, leading to suggestions of a compromise involving increased spending on defense-related infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has approved a $433 million joint venture between Foxconn and HCL Group to establish a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, India, with operations expected to begin by 2027. The facility will produce display driver chips used in mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and other consumer electronics, with a capacity of up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million chips per month. This deal is part of India's "Semiconductor Mission" to build a robust chips and display ecosystem, as Apple suppliers like Foxconn increasingly shift production away from China amid trade tensions. India aims to account for 15%-20% of total iPhone production by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that India has purportedly offered a trade deal that would eliminate all tariffs on goods imported from the United States. Speaking at an event in Doha, Trump mentioned that he had advised Apple CEO Tim Cook against expanding production in India, stating Apple would instead increase production in the United States. India and the US are currently negotiating a trade agreement, with Delhi having already lowered tariffs on certain US products; however, the US maintains a $45 billion trade deficit with India. India has recently signed trade deals with the UK and the European Free Trade Association.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations have arrived in Turkey for potential talks aimed at ending the ongoing war, although uncertainty surrounds whether the talks will even take place. The location is Dolmabahce, an Ottoman palace on the Bosporus, where talks between Ukraine and Russia took place in March 2022. The potential talks have been marked by gamesmanship, with initial reports suggesting the talks would occur at the palace, but confirmation remains elusive. This meeting comes as efforts to find a diplomatic resolution to the conflict continue.</p>

          <p>Crime rates on cruise ships departing from the U.S. have reached a two-year high, with 48 crimes reported between January 1 and March 30, 2025, including 23 reports of sexual assault and 10 reports of sexual assaults. Experts attribute the rise in crime to the high concentration of people in a confined space and the presence of alcohol, which can lead to altered behavior. Recent incidents include the arrest of two illegal immigrants for allegedly molesting a minor and a large brawl involving dozens of passengers disembarking a Carnival Cruise Line ship, resulting in 24 individuals being placed on a "do not sail list."</p>

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the growth primarily to the services sector, with significant contributions from production. Despite the positive figures, analysts caution that this strong growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic strength, while shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employer's National Insurance payments.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons to combat near-record high rice prices caused by a supply shortfall. This would involve releasing 300,000 tons over three months through July, in addition to 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The increased release could reduce the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests or natural disasters.

          <p>Research suggests that spending time in nature can have significant benefits for physical and mental health, including aiding recovery from injury. Studies have shown that even brief exposure to nature can reduce pain and enhance a sense of well-being. Experts say that nature provides a break for the brain, allowing it to restore and recuperate, and that emotions have a significant impact on physical well-being. Deliberate observation of nature can boost positive emotions, connection to others, and gratitude.</p>

          <p>During a methamphetamine bust in Vallejo, California, authorities discovered a baby spider monkey and two rattlesnakes at the residence of the suspect, Clifford Vincenty. Vincenty was initially arrested during a traffic stop for possession of methamphetamine, and the subsequent search of his home revealed more drugs, cash, and the exotic animals. The spider monkey, named Violeta, was placed in the Oakland Zoo, and Vincenty faces additional charges related to drug possession and potential violations concerning the possession of exotic animals. Wildlife trafficking is one of the largest illegal trades in the world, second only to drug and human trafficking.</p>

The academics confirmed the manuscript's authenticity after Harvard Law School photographed it under ultraviolet light and then subjected it to various levels of spectral imaging.

          <p>An intergovernmental grouping of 21 economies, including the U.S. and China, has warned that their collective growth is at risk of a sharp slowdown, citing tariff tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forecasts growth to drop to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year. The uncertainty is weighing on business confidence, leading many firms to delay investments and new product launches until the situation turns "more predictable."</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, but the looming threat of U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry is not a major factor. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that Denmark will be protected from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, as most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country, nor cross its borders. The IMF projects medium-term growth at around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

          <p>Julius Randle's 29 points led the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 121-110 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 5, securing their spot in the Western Conference finals for the second straight year. The Warriors played without Stephen Curry, who was out with a hamstring strain. The Timberwolves' strong performance and consistent scoring proved too much for the Warriors to overcome.</p>
