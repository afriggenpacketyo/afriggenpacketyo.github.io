          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake struck Bergen County, New Jersey, causing tremors felt in New York City and surrounding areas. This is the second seismic event in the state in under two weeks, following a larger 4.8 magnitude quake in April 2024. While no immediate damage was reported from the recent tremor, officials have warned of potential aftershocks and advised residents to check for any structural issues. The event highlights the activity of the Ramapo Fault line, which traverses the region and is responsible for minor but regular quakes.</p>

          <p>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is gaining traction, inspiring individuals to achieve financial freedom through aggressive saving and frugal living. The article profiles Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, and explores the philosophy popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache. The core principle involves saving 25 times one's annual expenses to live off a 4% annual withdrawal, fundamentally changing one's relationship with money and work. This lifestyle prioritizes personal freedom and experiences over material consumption.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Rebecca Solnit argues that focusing on high-profile cases like those of Jeffrey Epstein, Sean Combs, and Harvey Weinstein as isolated incidents obscures a pervasive societal pattern of violence against women. She contends that this violence is a constant, systemic issue rooted in misogyny, intended to maintain female subordination and inequality. The article criticizes the tendency to treat these stories as exceptional rather than as symptoms of a global pandemic of abuse, which impacts all women and shapes societal structures.</p>

          <p>Frustration is mounting in the WNBA over officiating, with players like Kelsey Plum and coaches like Cheryl Reeve publicly criticizing what they see as inconsistent and unreliable calls. Despite the backlash, league officials express confidence in their review process, which grades referees on every play. However, structural issues, such as a part-time referee pool and the lack of a centralized replay center, contribute to the problem, raising concerns about player safety and the sport's image as it enters a major new media rights deal.</p>

          <p>In a 2017 interview, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz discussed the 1976-77 murder spree that terrorized New York City, attributing his actions to demonic influence and a "break from reality."
