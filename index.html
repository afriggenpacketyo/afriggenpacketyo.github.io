          <p>British police are currently questioning five men, including four Iranian nationals, regarding an alleged terror plot targeting a specific location. The arrests occurred in various locations across England, including Swindon, London, Stockport, Rochdale, and Manchester. This investigation is separate from another counter-terrorism operation that led to the arrest of three other Iranian men in London. Commander Dominic Murphy emphasized that these investigations are significant, especially given the scale of activity and MI5's previous response to multiple Iran-backed plots since 2022, which posed potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate, emerged as the frontrunner in the first round of the Romanian presidential election rerun, campaigning against military support for Ukraine and expressing skepticism towards the EU. Simion's victory raises concerns in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance as a transit route for weapons to Ukraine and its role in NATO's air policing missions. Simion has stated that Russia is the biggest danger towards Romania, Poland, and the Baltic states. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania, and a visa-waiver agreement was recently cancelled.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists assert that "Shi’s Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world’s oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335 BC. The claim is supported by new evidence published in the astronomy journal 'Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics,' where researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates. If verified, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, which has been recognized as the oldest known stellar record until now. Experts believe that detailed astronomical studies began in both China and Greece around the same period.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has pledged to support its film industry in response to Donald Trump's proposal of 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US. Trump stated that foreign nations incentivize filmmakers to leave the United States, posing a national security threat. Australia, often called "Hollywood Down Under," offers a 30% rebate for big-budget film projects, attracting significant foreign productions. Industry peak body Screen Producers Australia (SPA) expressed uncertainty about the practical implications of the tariff, while Arts Minister Tony Burke affirmed the government's commitment to defending the rights of the Australian screen industry.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, General Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a more assertive stance, increasing tensions between Pakistan and India. General Munir's comments, including referring to Kashmir as Pakistan's "jugular vein," have been perceived as a need to project strength amid political and economic challenges within Pakistan. Analysts suggest that General Munir's views are shaped by his past intelligence roles and a belief in the religious nature of the conflict with India.

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" interfere with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit claims these policies violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.

Colorado officials deny being a sanctuary state and maintain they cooperate with law enforcement agencies.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, describing it as a national security threat due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers.

The details remain unclear, including whether the tariff would apply to American production companies filming abroad or to films on streaming services. Australia and New Zealand have voiced support for their film industries.

The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs using Chinese-made MA60 aircraft. The primary issue is a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed railway networks offer cheaper alternatives.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a plan to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing national security concerns. He authorized the United States Trade Representative to initiate the process of taxing all movies entering the country from foreign lands. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment. This action raises questions about the scope of the tariff, including its application to independent foreign films, streaming content, and movies receiving foreign tax incentives, potentially affecting thousands of film workers in the United States.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, contrary to the common association of roses with the color red. The study, published in 'Nature Plants,' examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of Rosa had single-petal flowers with a yellow hue and seven leaflets. Researchers from Beijing Forestry University noted that roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' have been regarded as symbols of love and beauty throughout history.</p>

China's AI firms are freely distributing their models, making them accessible globally, while apps like TikTok and Temu gain worldwide popularity. The authors suggest that the US needs to share its AI technologies and research more openly and innovate faster to maintain its competitive edge. Despite challenges, China's capacity to innovate and its dominance in global manufacturing pose a significant threat to US technological leadership.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top ODA donor, while Germany ranked second. The decline in Japan's donations was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to the sharp increases in 2022 and 2023. Japan views ODA as a critical diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence, despite facing fiscal challenges. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members fell in 2024 due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>
