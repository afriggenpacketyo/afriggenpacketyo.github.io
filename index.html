          <p>The Metropolitan Police are investigating whether a fire at Keir Starmer's London home is connected to two other recent fire incidents in the area. Counter-terrorism police are leading the probe as a precaution due to Starmer's high-profile status. While the cause of the fire is currently treated as suspicious, authorities are keeping an open mind regarding any connections between the three incidents. Starmer has expressed gratitude to the emergency services for their response, but declined further comment due to the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced legislation that would require many Medicaid recipients to prove they are working, volunteering, or in school for at least 80 hours a month to receive coverage. This proposal aims to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help offset the cost of President Trump's tax bill. Critics argue that these cuts would harm vulnerable Americans, potentially causing millions to lose coverage and posing a financial risk to hospitals. The bill also includes stricter income verification processes and could affect immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.</p>

The Library of Congress staff is currently recognizing Robert Newlen as the acting librarian, pending direction from Congress. Representative Joseph D.

          <p>Rising rent prices across the United States are making it increasingly difficult for renters to live comfortably, with Zillow calculating that renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to afford the typical apartment rental.

          <p>In the current economic climate, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) can be a viable financing source for homeowners, with average interest rates under 8%. A HELOC can be used for financing home projects, especially those that qualify for tax deductions. It's also beneficial when price changes are affordable, considering the variable interest rate, and when seeking the cheapest home equity borrowing option compared to alternatives like home equity loans or personal loans. Borrowers should carefully consider their financial circumstances before using a HELOC, as the home is used as collateral.</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old man died while hiking in Arizona’s Gold Canyon as temperatures reached about 100F (37.8C), officials said. Noah Farabaugh, from Arizona, was hiking with a group of five people in the Superstition Mountains, about 40 miles (65km) east of Phoenix, when he started having a medical emergency at around 12.45pm. Officials warned that heat illness can occur quickly, even for experienced hikers, especially as Arizona temperatures can rise above 110F (43.3C) in summer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is resuming collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, with the Education Department providing details about the timeline for wage garnishments. The Treasury Department will send notices to 5.3 million defaulted borrowers about wage collection activities, potentially starting as soon as June. Borrowers can challenge the wage garnishment if it results in financial hardship or if they've recently been unemployed or filed for bankruptcy. The Education Department can garnish up to 15% of disposable pay, leaving borrowers with at least $217.50 a week.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S. by tying costs to the lower prices often negotiated by other countries. The order asks drug companies to voluntarily lower their prices within 30 days, so the U.S. is paying the same amount that other wealthy countries pay for similar medications. If pharmaceutical companies don't lower their prices, the administration will pursue regulatory options. The Cato Institute praised the order, while pharmaceutical companies and the medical industry have argued that lowering prices could impact the ability to research and develop new drugs.</p>
