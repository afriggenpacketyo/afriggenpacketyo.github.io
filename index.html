          <p>European leaders have collectively insisted that any potential peace negotiations between the US and Russia must directly involve Ukraine. This unified stance comes ahead of a planned summit in Alaska between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, as concerns grow that a bilateral deal might be struck at Kyiv's expense. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly stated that any agreements made without his country's participation would be considered "dead decisions," rejecting any notion of ceding territory for peace. The allies emphasized that Ukraine's sovereignty is crucial for broader European security.</p>

          <p>Liverpool star Mohamed Salah publicly questioned European football's governing body, UEFA, regarding its tribute to former Palestinian player Suleiman al-Obeid. Salah highlighted that UEFA's statement failed to mention how al-Obeid died, a critical omission given reports from the Palestinian Football Association that he was killed by Israeli forces while awaiting aid in Gaza. The Egyptian forward, who has previously advocated for humanitarian aid in the region, pressed UEFA for details on the circumstances of the death. The incident has drawn further attention to the conflict's impact on the sports community.</p>

          <p>This article pays tribute to former Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a recent car accident, remembering him as a humble and grounded person despite his superstar status. Friends and mentors recall his deep connection to his roots, his generosity, and his simple nature, such as choosing to live in a club dormitory even after becoming a first-team player. The piece highlights how Jota never forgot those who helped him on his journey, from inviting his former dormitory caretaker to his wedding to donating football boots to youth players. He is remembered as an "ordinary boy living in a world of superstars."</p>

          <h2>Chinese Robotics Founder Predicts Major AI Breakthrough Within Two to Three Years</h2>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, has predicted that the field of robotics could experience its "ChatGPT moment" within the next one to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can successfully perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While acknowledging that current hardware is sufficient, Wang stated that the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the critical missing piece. He expressed some skepticism about current models but suggested that text-to-video generation for robot motion control holds significant promise.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are urging residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, due to a severe water service outage. The crisis began when a critical water control valve broke, affecting approximately 9,200 households during a heatwave and prompting a boil water advisory. Efforts to repair the valve and repressurize the system are being hampered by continued residential water consumption, which is depleting a 10-million-gallon tank faster than it can be filled. The situation was complicated further when a temporary bypass pipe burst, delaying the complex underground repairs.</p>

          <p>Northern China is once again grappling with its traditional rainy season, which has brought deadly floods to the region for the fifth time since 2012. This year's disaster is noted as being particularly unusual for Beijing, as the severe storms in late July primarily impacted the northern parts of the capital. This contrasts with major floods in previous years, such as those in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern areas. The recurring and shifting nature of these extreme weather events highlights the persistent climate challenges facing the region.</p>

The club's ability to register new players, including Rashford, was complicated by a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen and ongoing financial issues that do not meet La Liga's strict rules. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the Camp Nou stadium is behind schedule, forcing the team to continue playing elsewhere.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the world is moving dangerously closer to nuclear conflict, driven by the collapse of arms control treaties like the INF and a new, frantic arms race. The author points to Russia's abandonment of the treaty, its development of new hypersonic missiles, and NATO's corresponding military buildup in Europe as deeply worrying trends. The article laments the lack of widespread public protest, contrasting the current silence with the large anti-nuclear movements of the 1980s. It warns that nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as usable, offensive tools, raising the risk of an unthinkable catastrophe. (not investment advice)</p>
