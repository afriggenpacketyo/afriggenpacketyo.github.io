          <p>Exxon Mobil announced second-quarter earnings that, while lower than the previous year, exceeded Wall Street forecasts. The decline in profit, caused by reduced oil prices, was mitigated by significant production growth, particularly from its operations in the Permian Basin and Guyana. The company achieved its highest second-quarter output in over 25 years and reported substantial progress in cost-cutting measures. Exxon also returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, demonstrating financial strength amidst market fluctuations.</p>

Despite the revised outlook and an announcement of a 10% workforce reduction, the company's second-quarter results surpassed analyst expectations. The better-than-expected performance was attributed to significant cost-cutting efforts, as the biotech firm grapples with declining sales of its Covid vaccine and works to diversify its product pipeline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing a new system of trade that imposes sweeping tariffs on nearly 70 countries, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%. The new duties are scheduled to take effect in seven days, not immediately, providing a short window for goods already in transit. The administration states the rates are primarily based on trade deficits and are part of an "America First" economic strategy, though analyses suggest they could cost the average American household an additional $2,400 this year.</p>

He emphasized that the Premier League has maintained its 20-club, 380-match structure since 1994 and will not be forced to change.</p>

          <p>A recent poll conducted by Morning Consult for the Century Foundation indicates that a majority of Americans blame the Trump administration for the rising cost of living. Six in ten respondents said the administration's policies have driven up their expenses, with many specifically concerned about grocery prices and the impact of tariffs. The survey highlights widespread financial anxiety, with 83% of Americans worried about grocery costs and many fearing a looming economic recession while also blaming corporate interests.</p>

          <p>U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, whose son was murdered in a 2020 attack at her home, has spoken out about the rising tide of threats against jurists. She expressed deep anguish over a new intimidation tactic where disgruntled individuals send pizzas to judges' homes in her late son's name. The forum where she spoke highlighted an unprecedented hostile environment for judges, which many participants linked to inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders, creating a climate of fear and menace for the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Low-wage workers and anti-poverty advocates are bracing for increased hunger and hardship due to significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) initiated by the Trump administration. The changes shift greater administrative costs to states and expand work requirements, which could lead to millions of families losing benefits. This comes as many, including single mothers and part-time workers at large corporations like Walmart, increasingly rely on the aid amid a 23.6% rise in food prices since 2020.</p>

          <p>A new peer-reviewed study concludes that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in Southern California in January 2024 was likely caused by exposure to pesticides. Researchers found hundreds of dead or dying butterflies near a crucial overwintering site, exhibiting signs of neurotoxic poisoning. Subsequent testing of the insects revealed an average of seven different pesticides in each, at levels suspected to be lethal, providing rare, direct evidence of how pesticides contribute to the dramatic decline of monarch populations in the wild.</p>

          <p>Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has sold his final equity stake in the firm and stepped down from its board. This move completes a long-planned management transition that began in 2022, officially ending his control over the firm he started in 1975. Dalio will continue to serve as a mentor to the new leadership and remain a significant investor in the firm's strategies, marking the end of an era for the influential macro investor.</p>

          <p>Rising global temperatures are making mountaineering more dangerous by melting the snow and ice that act as a natural "glue" on mountains, leading to increased rockfalls and avalanches. This article explains how climate change is visibly altering landscapes in ranges like the Karakoram and Himalayas, forcing expeditions to change their schedules and climbing practices to avoid deadly risks. The death of mountaineer Laura Dahlmeier from falling rocks is cited as an example of these increasing objective dangers.</p>

          <p>The UK's meteorological service has named Storm Floris, the fifth named storm of the season, which is expected to hit the country on Monday. Forecasters are predicting heavy rain and strong winds, with potential gusts of 60 to 80 mph in some coastal and hilly areas, particularly in the north. The storm is developing in the Atlantic and is expected to be intensified by an active jet stream, posing a risk of travel disruption, power outages, and potential damage from falling trees.</p>

          <p>In a new social mobility initiative, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more reflective of the country by harnessing a broader range of talent. Successful interns will be fast-tracked for the prestigious Fast Stream graduate program, though the move has been criticized by Conservatives as "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of the Stasi, East Germany's Ministry for State Security, which systematically spied on its citizens to maintain the ruling party's power. Under the motto "we must know everything," the Stasi used a vast network of full-time officers and up to 200,000 informal informants to conduct surveillance. Its methods included reading mail, wiretapping calls, illegal searches, and psychological intimidation to suppress any form of dissent against the German Democratic Republic (GDR) regime.</p>

This innovative method aims to disrupt smuggling networks and protect the country's large but threatened rhino population from being poached for their horns, which are highly valued in some Asian markets.</p>

          <p>A commentary in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army has warned that a new US military weapon system poses a threat to regional security. The system places a missile launcher inside a standard shipping container, allowing it to be easily concealed and transported on civilian trucks or ships. The PLA commentary notes that this high level of concealment improves the weapon's survivability and gives the US military the capability to achieve tactical surprise in a conflict.</p>

          <p>An old, abandoned Southern California Edison power line suspected of igniting the deadly Eaton fire could have been removed years ago under a proposed state rule. However, records and interviews show that utility companies, including Edison, successfully lobbied to weaken the regulation in 2005. The final rule allowed them to leave unused lines in place indefinitely if they determined a "foreseeable future use," a change that critics say perverted the original safety intent and may have contributed to the recent tragedy.</p>

          <p>An FDA-organized expert panel has drawn sharp criticism from prominent medical societies for making "unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims" about the risks of using SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy. Groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists argue the panel misrepresented scientific evidence and ignored the well-documented dangers of untreated maternal depression. Critics state that robust evidence shows most SSRIs are safe in pregnancy and that the panel's comments create unnecessary confusion for patients.</p>
