          <p>Luke Humphries secured his first Premier League nightly victory in 10 weeks by defeating Luke Littler 6-5 in a thrilling final in Leeds. Humphries, who had previously beaten Littler on Night 4 in Exeter, rallied from a 2-0 deficit to win the match, averaging 100.96 against Littler's 99.89. Wearing a Leeds United-inspired shirt, Humphries overcame a sluggish start to win three straight legs and ultimately seal the victory with a double 10 finish, securing his place at the finals night on May 29 at the 02 Arena.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with the United Kingdom, emphasizing increased market access for American exports, particularly agricultural products.

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines, violating the Voting Rights Act.

The judges criticized Alabama's "deliberate decision to ignore" their order to create a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing.

          <p>A mistrial has been declared in the case against Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, during a traffic stop. The jury was unable to reach a verdict after the incident, which was captured on multiple video sources, sparked widespread protests and highlighted racial injustice and policing issues. The central point of contention was the scuffle over Schurr's Taser, with the officer testifying he feared for his life.</p>

          <p>The increasing public focus on individual federal judges, rather than on law and precedent, is a concerning trend that could undermine the rule of law. This shift is exacerbated by Trump's attacks on judges who rule against his policies, which delegitimizes the court system. While scrutiny of public officials is necessary, focusing on judges' personalities can be detrimental to a government based on laws, not individuals. The article suggests that the media should prioritize legal principles over the personalities of judges to maintain the integrity of the judiciary.</p>
