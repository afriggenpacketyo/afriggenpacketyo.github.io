          <p>This article presents the concluding text from Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in the 2015 Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Kennedy eloquently argues that the petitioners seek the profound union of marriage not to disrespect the institution, but to find fulfillment and escape condemnation to loneliness. He asserts that their plea is for equal dignity under the law, a right he concludes is granted to them by the U.S. Constitution. The text represents a pivotal moment in American civil rights history, reversing the lower court's judgment.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have started their closing arguments in the sex trafficking trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, portraying him as a man who used his wealth, power, and a network of employees to operate a criminal enterprise. The prosecution alleges Combs orchestrated brutal sex crimes and relied on "power, violence and fear," believing his fame placed him above the law. After seven weeks of testimony from 34 witnesses, the prosecution rested its case, and the defense also rested without calling any witnesses. Combs, who faces a potential sentence of 15 years to life if convicted, has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>Wander Franco, a shortstop for the Tampa Bay Rays, has been found guilty of sexual abuse of a minor in the Dominican Republic and received a two-year suspended prison sentence.

Franco was arrested last year and also faced charges of commercial and sexual exploitation, which are not specified in the final verdict.

          <p>The UK government is set to announce significant concessions on its proposed welfare reforms following pressure from over 100 rebel Labour MPs. Under the expected deal, existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit will not see their benefits reduced. The government's climbdown averts a potential legislative defeat on its flagship bill, which aimed to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability benefits. This marks the third major policy U-turn by the government in a month, raising questions about the prime minister's authority.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct images of an exoplanet, a planet outside our solar system. The newly found planet, named TWA 7b, is estimated to be similar in mass to Saturn and orbits a young star. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph, a tool that blocks a star's bright light, to detect the faint planet, which would typically be very difficult to observe directly. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet.</p>

          <p>A new survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation indicates that a Fourth of July barbecue for ten people in California will cost approximately $90.06, significantly higher than the national average of $70.92. This is the first year the survey has included California-specific data, revealing premiums on staples like ground beef, chicken, and even hamburger buns. The report attributes the elevated prices to several factors, including Trump administration tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, reduced cattle availability, and potential farm labor disruptions. Farmers themselves reportedly see little benefit from these higher retail costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats expressed skepticism regarding the Trump administration's claims that recent strikes had 'totally obliterated' Iran's nuclear facilities. Senators Chris Murphy and Mark Warner suggested the president may have deliberately misled the public, stating their belief that Iran retains significant nuclear capabilities and that the program was set back by months, not years. While some Republicans defended the administration's assessment, the briefing appears to have deepened partisan divisions over the strategy and effectiveness of the military action, with Democrats criticizing the lack of a coherent long-term plan.</p>

While digital sales saw a significant 26% drop, sales at Nike's physical stores showed a modest 2% increase.
