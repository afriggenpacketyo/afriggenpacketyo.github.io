          <p>During Liverpool Football Club's Premier League victory parade, a driver struck a number of pedestrians on Water Street. Police detained a male at the scene, and emergency personnel responded to the incident. United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident "shocking" and stated his thoughts are with those injured, asking that the police be given space to investigate.

          <p>Despite President Trump's decision to postpone implementing 50% tariffs on European Union goods until July 9, analysts caution investors to brace for ongoing market volatility. The delay, following discussions with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, offers a temporary respite, but significant trade tensions persist. Experts suggest the six-week extension may not suffice to resolve all detailed issues, though it could establish a framework for a trade agreement. Some believe Trump's negotiation tactics involve creating shock to elicit concessions, but the EU is unlikely to succumb to such pressure (not investment advice).</p>

He emphasized that sharks are essential for a healthy ocean ecosystem and that current shark killing rates are unsustainable. The swim was particularly challenging due to the cold water, strong winds, and the constant awareness of sharks in the water.</p>

The B-24 bomber "Heaven Can Wait" was shot down in 1944, killing all 11 crew members; the recovery mission was initiated after a relative of one of the crew members, Scott Althaus, researched the crash site. Navy divers recovered dog tags and other personal items, leading to the identification of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick.</p>

          <p>Nine European Union member states, led by Italy and Denmark, are advocating for a "new interpretation" of the European Convention on Human Rights to facilitate the deportation of foreign national criminals. The group argues that the current interpretation limits their ability to make political decisions regarding migration. Critics, including the Council of Europe's secretary-general, caution against politicizing the court and emphasize the importance of judicial independence. Experts note that existing laws already permit the deportation of individuals posing security threats, and that other factors like cooperation between member states and third countries play a significant role.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed its sporadic eruption, shooting lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing large plumes of ash and volcanic material. The activity, which lasted for several hours, included lava fountains reaching heights of over 1,000 feet and an eruptive plume extending at least 5,000 feet. While lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera and did not affect residential areas, authorities warned of potential hazards from ash and volcanic fragments carried by the wind. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has been emitting lava fountains frequently since December 2024, drawing tourists to witness the spectacle.</p>

Despite expressing shock at the Russian attacks, Trump has not linked them to his decision to withhold economic pressure or military assistance. Experts suggest this pattern reflects a strategic void in which Trump criticizes Russian aggression but remains unwilling to make Putin pay a price. Trump has also refused to join European allies in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia.</p>
