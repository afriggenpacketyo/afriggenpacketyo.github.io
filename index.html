        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time to grieve without resorting to sick leave. The move has been praised by campaigners like Myleene Klass and MPs, who see it as a significant step in legally recognizing early-stage pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement rather than a medical issue.</p>

          <p>Former multiple world boxing champion Ricky Hatton has announced he will return to the sport, 13 years after his retirement. At 46, Hatton is scheduled to fight Eisa Al Dah of the UAE in a middleweight match on December 2 in Dubai. The announcement was made during a promotional event in Dubai, with Hatton confirming his comeback via a livestream. He explained his absence from the event was due to a minor, non-permanent eye injury caused by his sunglasses. Hatton, who previously held titles at welterweight and light-welterweight, expressed his excitement for the upcoming fight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock value dropped over 7% in premarket trading after CEO Elon Musk revealed his intention to launch a new political party called the "America Party." This move has renewed investor concerns about Musk's increasing involvement in politics, which some see as a distraction during a critical period for the company. Analysts, such as Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, note that shareholders are growing weary of Musk's political ventures, fearing potential negative impacts on the Tesla brand. The announcement follows a period of stock recovery after Musk previously stepped away from a government advisory role. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Confusion has arisen regarding the implementation date for new US trade tariffs, after President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick provided conflicting information. While a 90-day pause on tariffs was set to end on July 9, officials have now stated the new rates will take effect on August 1. This extended uncertainty has negatively impacted Asian and European stock markets and industrial metal prices. The administration plans to send letters to trading partners outlining new rates or confirming deals, giving countries an additional three-week reprieve but prolonging market instability.

          <p>Recent youth-led protests in Kenya are being compared to the historic "Saba Saba" (July 7) demonstrations of the 1990s, which were pivotal in moving the country toward multi-party democracy. Analysts note that both movements share a core demand for better governance, accountability, and an end to corruption and state-sanctioned violence. While the original Saba Saba protests had clear political leaders, the current Gen Z-led movement is a leaderless, grassroots effort amplified by technology. Despite the evolution in protest methods, the government's forceful response, including extrajudicial killings and abductions, mirrors the oppressive tactics of the past regime.</p>

With issues like the war in Ukraine and economic competition taking precedence, ambitious climate policies have faced a backlash. Danish officials are reframing the green transition as essential for Europe's strategic autonomy and defense, arguing that reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports enhances security. However, this approach faces challenges, as some EU member states, including Poland and Italy, express concerns that ambitious emissions targets could hinder economic development.</p>

          <p>Maro Itoje will captain the British and Irish Lions for their match against the Brumbies in Canberra, in a lineup that appears to be a strong indicator of the team for the first Test against the Wallabies. Key selections include Blair Kinghorn at full-back, the Irish duo of Garry Ringrose and Bundee Aki in the midfield, and the expected half-back pairing of Finn Russell and Jamison Gibson-Park. The front row features Ellis Genge, Dan Sheehan, and Tadhg Furlong. The selection provides insight into coach Andy Farrell's thinking ahead of the highly anticipated Test series beginning on July 19.</p>

          <p>A 14-member team of British engineers has arrived in Kerala, India, to repair an advanced F-35B fighter jet that has been stranded for over three weeks. The jet was diverted to Thiruvananthapuram airport on June 14 due to bad weather and subsequently reported a technical issue, preventing its return to the HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier. After an initial assessment by the ship's engineers proved unsuccessful, the specialist team was deployed from the UK with necessary equipment. The $110 million stealth jet is being guarded around the clock by RAF officers while it awaits repair or potential dismantling for transport.</p>

          <p>A bilateral agreement between the U.S. and China has lifted a ban on the sale of American jet engine components, a move expected to ensure the continued production of China's homegrown C919 aircraft. The deal allows the state-owned manufacturer Comac to import critical parts from a GE-affiliated joint venture, which is essential for fulfilling hundreds of existing orders for the narrowbody jet. Analysts note that while this secures the C919's production line for now, the previous U.S. restrictions have likely reinforced Beijing's determination to accelerate the development of its own domestic engine technology to reduce future reliance.

          <p>Police in Lahore, Pakistan, have arrested the owners of a pet lion after it escaped and attacked a woman and her two young children. CCTV footage captured the moment the big cat leaped over a wall and chased the woman down. The victims sustained injuries but are in stable condition. The owners face charges of negligence and keeping a wild animal without a proper license. Keeping big cats is a status symbol in Pakistan, and while legal with a permit, they must be housed outside city limits, a rule violated in this case. The incident has prompted a crackdown on illegal wildlife possession.</p>

          <p>After a nine-week trial that captivated Australia, Erin Patterson has been found guilty of murdering three of her in-laws and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms.

Prosecutors highlighted strained family relations and presented evidence that she intentionally used the toxic fungi in individual beef Wellington pastries. Patterson lied to police about key evidence, including a food dehydrator later found to contain traces of the mushrooms. She now faces a potential life sentence.</p>

Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have resumed in Qatar over a U.S.-sponsored proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release. President Trump has expressed confidence a deal could be reached this week. The diplomatic push comes after a recent 12-day war between Israel and Iran, which analysts believe has shifted regional dynamics and may make both Israel and Hamas more amenable to an agreement. However, significant obstacles remain, and both Palestinians and Israeli hostage families express only cautious optimism.</p>

          <p>A growing housing crisis across Europe is being attributed to the increasing financialization of the real estate market. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have poured trillions into residential property, treating housing as a lucrative asset class. This has driven up prices and rents, making homeownership unattainable for many and fueling political discontent. Critics argue that despite claims of increasing supply, these financial actors profit from housing shortages and often prioritize shareholder returns over residents' needs, leading to renovictions and unaffordable living conditions.

In a clinical trial, a single injection of a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear significantly improved hearing in all 10 participants, who had hearing loss caused by a deficiency of the protein otoferlin. The effects were rapid, with noticeable improvement within a month. One seven-year-old girl regained almost full hearing. The treatment, which was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offers hope that similar therapies could be developed for other genetic forms of deafness.</p>
