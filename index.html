        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested Japan to increase its defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, according to a Japan-U.S. diplomatic source. This request will likely cause Tokyo to cancel a planned high-level meeting with Washington. The request was reportedly made by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, and the increased demand will likely lead Japan to cancel a planned meeting of the countries' foreign and defense chiefs, which was scheduled in Washington before Japan's House of Councillors election. In 2022, Japan decided to double its annual defense budget to 2 percent of GDP by 2027, but Trump continues to complain that the U.S.-Japan security treaty is one-sided. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News accuses legacy media outlets of burying a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing investigating former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. The author claims that broadcast networks skipped the hearing because their "news judgment" aligns with Democrat objectives. The article contrasts this with the extensive coverage given to the House Special Committee on the January 6 attack, which the author describes as a partisan effort. The author suggests that Americans should look to conservative and independent media for coverage that liberals want to suppress.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the Minnesota shootings, in which Vance Luther Boelter allegedly attacked state senator John Hoffman and killed former house speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband. Following the attacks, right-wing figures spread disinformation, falsely claiming that Boelter was appointed by Minnesota's governor and was Walz's hitman. Senator Mike Lee used the platform of his office to push the disinformation, and the author argues that Lee's actions reveal a depraved mentality and political imagination. The article connects Boelter's actions and Lee's response to the influence of Trump and the divisive character of the Trump era.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is leveraging his presidency to launch Trump-branded products, including a "sleek gold" Trump Mobile phone, priced at $499, with a premium service tier called the 47 Plan. Marketing experts suggest this is a typical Trump side-hustle playing off Maga patriotism, blurring the lines between business and politics. Critics argue this presidency is a brand-franchise with no separation between power and profit, accelerating the notion of post-ethical politics. The Trump Organization has also increased its Trump-branded real-estate projects around the globe, including an 80-story skyscraper in Dubai, and plans for branded hotels in Riyadh and Jeddah.</p>

          <p>David Litt, a former Obama speechwriter, befriended his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a Joe Rogan fan, through surfing. Litt's book, *It's Only Drowning*, explores how shared activities can bridge political and cultural divides. Litt, a Yale-educated liberal, initially found Kappler's views and lifestyle unbridgeable, but learning to surf together provided neutral ground for connection. He argues for shared activities that allow for connection and understanding between individuals with differing views, emphasizing the need to find neutral ground and forget about the idea of common ground.</p>

          <p>Pip Adam's novel *Audition* uses outer space to explore themes of exploitation and the possibility of new human connections. The story follows three giants, once regular-size humans, confined to a spaceship headed toward a black hole. The ship gets its power from their speech, which becomes a means of control, preventing them from realizing what has been taken from them. The novel suggests that even language can be corrupted and used for exploitation, but crossing the event horizon of the black hole offers a frontier of hope and the potential for new forms of association, free from Earth's prejudices.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that going to war with Iran would be perilous to American democracy, given Donald Trump's dictatorial control over law enforcement and the military. The author suggests that Trump could use a state of war to strengthen his power at home, suppress dissent, and violate the rights of citizens. Additionally, the author expresses concern that any success Trump claims in Iran would be a victory for anti-liberal forces globally. The article concludes that the United States is at risk of becoming a military dictatorship, and war with Iran would likely hasten its demise.</p>

After the shootings, Boelter's wife was pulled over by law enforcement and investigators found two handguns, passports, and about $10,000 in cash.

          <p>The LAPD faces criticism and litigation over tactics used during recent protests, including the use of foam projectiles and tear gas. Despite promises to rein in indiscriminate use of force, demonstrators and journalists were injured after being targeted by officers. Some protesters allege officers deliberately targeted individuals who posed no threat, and tensions ran high between LAPD commanders and City Hall officials. The latest protest response is widely seen as another step backward, potentially leading to expensive court battles.</p>

          <p>Two sculptures worth $2.1 million were stolen from a warehouse in Anaheim Hills, prompting a police investigation. The sculptures, “Icarus Within” and “Quantum Mechanics: Homme,” belong to artist Daniel Winn and weigh thousands of pounds. Authorities have scant details about the heist, and the theft is considered the largest burglary in the Anaheim Police Department's history. Winn believes the pieces may have been stolen by an unscrupulous collector, while an art recovery expert suspects the sculptures will be destroyed for scrap metal.</p>

Experts worry that Israel's missile interceptors could eventually run out, leading to a dire situation. Israel may have to prioritize defending key military targets over civilian infrastructure, potentially increasing destruction in Israeli cities. The article also discusses the importance of missile launchers and how their destruction is a key target for Israeli strikes, while civilians on both sides continue to pay a heavy price.</p>

          <p>Investigators are examining possible motives for the killing of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, and the shooting of another legislator and his wife. While public discourse has focused on political affiliations, some scholars suggest examining the suspect's religious background and views on abortion. Researchers point to Boelter's connection with the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), which uses war terminology and imagery when discussing political and spiritual enemies. Boelter's opposition to abortion and belief in modern-day prophets and apostles align with NAR teachings, potentially shedding light on his motives.</p>

This initiative is part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, with £650m invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The scheme aims to ease pressure on services by providing personalized healthcare to prevent ill-health before symptoms begin. Screening will involve sequencing complete DNA using blood samples from the umbilical cord, and the NHS will need qualified professionals to interpret the data for patients.</p>

Large-scale joint forces exercises involve multiple military branches and simulate comprehensive invasion scenarios, signaling a high level of threat.</p>

          <p>Japan has been quietly blazing a trail for supply chain resilience, becoming something of a canary in the coal mine for Beijing's mineral dominance. Following a heated territorial dispute in 2010, China implemented an export ban on rare earths that specifically targeted Tokyo. Alongside stockpiling, recycling and promoting alternative technologies, Japan has since invested heavily into non-China rare-earth projects. As a result, Japan's overall dependence on Chinese rare earths has dropped to below 60% from more than 90% at the time of the incident.</p>
