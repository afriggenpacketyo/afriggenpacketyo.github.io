        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a greater-than-expected contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to a decline in exports and stagnant consumption. This marks the first quarterly drop since early 2024. The economic slowdown is further exacerbated by potential tariffs imposed by the United States, creating uncertainty for Japanese businesses. Economists warn that this contraction, coupled with an aging population and rising welfare costs, could lead to increased calls for fiscal spending and potentially trigger a recession, highlighting vulnerabilities in Japan's economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a political crisis as far-right candidate George Simion gains momentum ahead of the presidential runoff election. Simion's rise is attributed to decades of economic failure, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, fueling anti-establishment sentiment. The mainstream parties' lack of focus on addressing the country's broken economic model has paved the way for Simion's populist appeal.

While confidence in U.S. assets is being restored with softening trade stances, the surge highlights Japan's appeal as a safe-haven destination.

The situation raises ethical and legal questions about fetal rights versus the rights of incapacitated pregnant women.

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to falling exports. The contraction, exceeding economists' expectations, is attributed to uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies. While domestic demand showed strength, export weakness persists, potentially impacting Japan's economic recovery. Experts suggest that a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. could mitigate the tariff impact, allowing the Bank of Japan to maintain its current policy rate, while the central bank warns of downside risks from global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or risk becoming a "shock absorber" in the face of global trade imbalances caused by the US-China trade war. Despite a recent easing of tensions between the superpowers, economists caution that Europe must adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder trade.

Conservatives suing the Biden administration often file cases in small Texas courts with Republican appointees, while liberals during the Trump administration favored larger venues in the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction, raising concerns about impartiality and the integrity of the court system.</p>
