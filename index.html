          <p>The lawyer for Bella Culley, a 19-year-old pregnant British woman detained in Georgia for alleged drug smuggling, has accused the British embassy of failing to provide adequate support. He claims the embassy has not visited since he was appointed and has not offered written references or health checks for his client, who faces a potential life sentence. The Foreign Office stated it is supporting the woman and is in contact with her family, though it confirmed only one in-person visit. Culley pleaded not guilty, asserting she was coerced through torture.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation revealed that at least 55,000 people in England require new blood tests due to errors from diabetes diagnostic machines made by Trinity Biotech. The faulty machines, used by 16 hospital trusts, have led to some patients being wrongly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and prescribed unnecessary medication. NHS England has confirmed a 4% higher-than-expected rise in diagnoses in 2024, which may be linked to the issue. The manufacturer is cooperating with regulators, and affected patients are being contacted for re-testing.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for former President Joe Biden confirmed he recently underwent Mohs surgery, a common procedure to treat skin cancer, after being seen with a bandage on his head. This follows a previous procedure in February 2023 where a basal cell carcinoma was successfully removed from his chest. Before his presidency, Biden had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed using the same surgical technique. His health was also in the news in May when it was announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) appeared to reaffirm its support for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, despite growing concern over his past anti-Israel statements and far-left policy positions. The DNC shared a clip of Mamdani advocating for a broad coalition, which drew criticism from some who see it as the party embracing radicalism. This comes as key Democratic leaders have yet to endorse Mamdani's campaign, highlighting internal party divisions over his candidacy in a city with a large Jewish population.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to have the Pentagon use "Department of War" as a secondary title, with the Defense Secretary being known as the Secretary of War. The administration argues the name change, which reverts to the department's pre-1947 title, better conveys a message of readiness and resolve. While a permanent legal name change would require congressional approval, the White House believes the rebranding aligns with its goal of refocusing the military on a "warrior ethos" away from what it terms "woke ideology."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, alleging that the city's sanctuary policies violate federal law by refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the policies undermine law enforcement and protect criminals from justice. The lawsuit specifically targets the Boston Trust Act, which limits the city's role in federal immigration matters. Mayor Wu has previously stated that the city would not back down, asserting that immigration enforcement is a federal, not local, responsibility.</p>

Arora emphasized the high risk of credential theft in corporate environments and stressed the need for robust identity security solutions, highlighting his company's planned acquisition of CyberArk to address these vulnerabilities.</p>

Roy reflects on how this turbulent upbringing shaped her as a writer, providing a "reportage of the heart" rather than a traditional hagiography.

Manager Michael O'Neill credited a stern half-time talk for inspiring the team's improved second-half performance. Jamie Reid scored an early goal, but Luxembourg equalized before the break. Shea Charles quickly restored the lead just seconds into the second half, and Justin Devenny sealed the victory after Luxembourg was reduced to 10 men, giving the team the desired result on the road.</p>

          <p>A powerful "rotten egg" odor has blanketed parts of Gloucester, Massachusetts, caused by large quantities of an invasive Japanese seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica. City officials explained that Hurricane Erin's storm surge washed the seaweed ashore and into an estuary, where it is now trapped and decaying, releasing the foul-smelling gas. The red seaweed, first recorded on the East Coast in 2009, spreads aggressively and is known to cause environmental issues. Residents have compared the overpowering smell to raw sewage, disrupting daily life in the coastal community.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with significant funds, such as $10,000, should consider strategic moves for their Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. Financial experts advise savers to act quickly, as banks often adjust their rates in anticipation of Fed decisions, meaning the current high-rate window could close soon. It is recommended to shop for the best rates primarily at online banks, which typically offer higher returns, and to determine the optimal deposit amount and term length to maximize earnings before rates fall further. Waiting too long could result in missing out on potentially the best returns available for the foreseeable future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has ended his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur. While the official announcement stated he "stepped down," reports suggest the club's ownership group, ENIC, made the decision in a bid for greater on-field success. During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new £1 billion stadium and the club won two trophies, but he was also a frequent target of fan protests over a perceived lack of investment in the playing squad. Peter Charrington, a director of ENIC, will become the new non-executive chairman.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a lower court's order that would have shut down the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay, allowing construction and operation of the facility to continue while the state of Florida's appeal is heard. A district judge had previously ordered the facility to be wound down, citing environmental concerns and harsh conditions for detainees. The appellate panel's majority opinion stated that the government was likely to prevail in its argument that the state-funded project was not subject to federal environmental reviews.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Senate testimony suggests a significant shift from the more reassuring tone he adopted during his confirmation hearings. In a combative performance, he aggressively defended anti-vaccine talking points and clashed with senators from both parties, who expressed alarm at his recent actions, including shaking up the CDC and limiting COVID vaccine access. This defiant demeanor contrasts sharply with his earlier promises to lawmakers that he would not undermine the U.S. vaccination system. The hearing indicates that Kennedy, potentially with President Trump's backing, feels emboldened to pursue his long-standing activist agenda from his cabinet position.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order centered on the Global South is gaining traction, particularly in the Muslim world. As U.S. global primacy wanes, Beijing's vision of "true multilateralism" appeals to developing nations frustrated with Western-led institutions like the IMF and World Bank. States in the Middle East and beyond are recalibrating their foreign policies, strengthening ties with China to diversify their economic and political partnerships. This shift signals a potential paradigm change in international relations, moving away from a U.S.-dominated framework toward a more multipolar world.</p>

The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen from over 7% in January to 6.50% in early September, representing significant potential savings. While rates are not as low as they were in 2020-2021, the trend is encouraging. With the Federal Reserve expected to implement a small rate cut this month, there is potential for mortgage rates to decline further, although the drop is likely to be gradual rather than immediate.

The move, which comes amid a push by the Trump administration's HHS to question vaccine consensus, has been criticized as a dangerous step that could dismantle herd immunity and lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases.
