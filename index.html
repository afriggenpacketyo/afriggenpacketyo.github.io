          <p>Martin Powers, a historian, highlights how examining Chinese society through art reveals widespread political ideas, offering insights beyond written texts. He uses the example of a Han dynasty prime minister's story, depicted across various art forms, to illustrate a normative concept of jurisdictional limits. Powers argues that art 'participates' in political debate by showing how intergroup relations and authority are understood. He draws parallels between Chinese aristocratic concepts of arbitrary privilege and Montesquieu's idea of 'honour' in Western thought, suggesting a deeper historical connection in political philosophy. This article explores the enduring relevance of ancient Chinese governance principles. </p>

          <p>President Trump authorized the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members to Chicago and sent California National Guard troops to Oregon, despite objections from Democratic governors. The deployments aim to protect federal property and personnel amidst ongoing demonstrations. In Oregon, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the state's National Guard, citing a lack of evidence for a 'rebellion' and questioning the president's authority. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue the administration over the federalization of his state's Guard, calling it an 'abuse of power.' These actions highlight escalating tensions between the federal government and state leaders over protest responses. </p>

          <p>The Conservative party plans to announce proposals for cutting £47 billion from public spending over five years, targeting welfare, aid, and civil service. Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride is expected to outline measures including stopping welfare claims for individuals with 'low-level mental health problems' and reducing civil servant numbers by a quarter. The proposals also involve cutting aid spending to 0.1% of national income and maintaining the two-child benefit cap. These plans follow a previous Labour government attempt to cut disability benefits that faced internal opposition. Critics, like the Institute for Economic Affairs, warn against ignoring age-related spending, while international development groups condemn the aid cuts. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has introduced new housing market reforms designed to reduce costs, minimize delays, and halve failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes would 'fix the broken system,' potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and cutting transaction times by up to four weeks. Key proposals include legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide upfront information about property condition, leasehold costs, and chain details. The reforms also suggest introducing binding contracts to prevent late-stage deal collapses, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. Additionally, a new mandatory Code of Practice for industry professionals and performance data will aim to boost standards. </p>

This move would signify a pivotal evolution, with profound geopolitical and economic implications. As China's leadership prepares for the 15th five-year plan, the article suggests prioritizing domestic consumption to address structural imbalances that have long favored investment and exports. The author contends that embracing a 'consumed in China' model, rather than solely 'made in China,' is crucial for the nation's ambition of becoming a 'modern socialist country' and fostering a more balanced global economy. </p>

Skinner and his professional partner Amy Dowden performed a salsa, while Robshaw and Nadiya Bychkova reprised their Viennese waltz. The judges voted to save Robshaw, leading to Skinner's departure. Skinner, 34, expressed his enjoyment of the experience despite his limited dancing ability, praising Dowden. Dowden, who recently returned to the show after a breast cancer diagnosis, thanked Skinner for helping her regain confidence, emphasizing that happiness and health are paramount. </p>

          <p>A collision between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri at the Singapore Grand Prix has created renewed tension, despite the team clinching its second consecutive constructors' championship. Norris, who slid into Piastri after contact with Max Verstappen, defended his move, stating any driver would have done the same. Piastri expressed unhappiness over team radio, though he was more circumspect post-race. This incident is the second collision between the drivers this year and follows previous controversial team decisions that disadvantaged Piastri. Team principal Andrea Stella vowed detailed reviews to maintain team unity, acknowledging the high stakes beyond championship points. </p>

          <p>At this year's Conservative party conference in Manchester, tributes to Margaret Thatcher are prominent as the party seeks to revive its fortunes after a recent election defeat. Leader Kemi Badenoch is reportedly drawing inspiration from Thatcher's early years in power. Think tanks and former MPs suggest applying Thatcherite principles to modern challenges, such as reining in 'lanyard classes' in government bodies and reforming the energy sector. The party aims to rebuild its reputation for economic competence, distinguishing itself from Labour and Reform UK's spending plans. Comparisons are drawn to Thatcher's handling of the SDP challenge, emphasizing a focus on core Conservative values to regain public trust. </p>

The 30-year-old winger, who last played for England almost a year ago, emphasized his focus on Everton, which has 'put their trust in me.' Former England striker Wayne Rooney believes Grealish's form will eventually earn him a spot in the World Cup squad.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson bristled when questioned about his refusal to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) while Congress is out of session due to the government shutdown. Democrats allege that Johnson is intentionally delaying Grijalva's swearing-in because she is seen as a critical swing vote for a discharge petition to release the Epstein Files. Welker pressed Johnson on whether the House could still be doing critical work, but Johnson dismissed the 'Epstein files' connection as 'totally absurd' and a 'red herring.' This incident highlights political maneuvering and the broader implications of the ongoing shutdown beyond funding debates. </p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Israel's war in Gaza has not fully achieved its stated objectives of recovering all hostages and destroying Hamas. While 148 hostages have been returned, 48 remain, with only 20 believed to be alive. Hamas, though weakened, continues to operate. The conflict has resulted in over 66,000 Palestinian deaths, 90% of homes damaged or destroyed, and widespread famine. International condemnation, including accusations of genocide and ICC arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, has led to 20 additional countries recognizing Palestinian statehood and some halting arms exports to Israel. The war has also seen Israel strike Hezbollah and Iranian nuclear facilities, but the long-term path to peace remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>The stock market, which saw the S&P 500 reach a record high despite the government shutdown, is increasingly monitoring the stalemate in Washington. Investors are betting on a temporary shutdown with furloughed workers receiving back pay, but President Trump's threats of mass federal firings introduce uncertainty and potential litigation. The absence of official economic data makes real-time corporate commentary more valuable. This week, attention turns to an investor day for Solstice Advanced Materials, Honeywell's specialty chemicals business, ahead of its planned spin-off on October 30. The market hopes progress on these separations will reduce stock overhang and clarify business valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Satellite data spanning 24 years reveals a disturbing trend: the Northern Hemisphere is steadily getting darker compared to the Southern Hemisphere, a shift that could redefine global climate patterns. This 'darkening,' or reduced ability to reflect sunlight, is linked to melted sea ice, decreasing snow cover exposing darker surfaces, and a decline in aerosols due to tighter air-pollution regulations. Natural events like Australia's bushfires and the Hunga Tonga eruption temporarily increased reflection in the Southern Hemisphere but couldn't offset the global imbalance. This broken symmetry in energy absorption drives changes in air and ocean circulation, potentially intensifying warming in northern continents and altering rainfall patterns. </p>
