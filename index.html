          <p>Former President Donald Trump has claimed he knows "nothing" about a classified 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, as detailed in a New York Times report. The operation's goal was allegedly to plant a surveillance device to intercept communications from leader Kim Jong-un amidst nuclear talks. According to the article, which cites numerous anonymous government and military sources, the mission was aborted after the SEALs fatally shot several unarmed North Korean civilians they feared had discovered their presence. The report also alleges that the Trump administration, which purportedly approved the mission, never disclosed the failed and violent operation to Congress.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in at least 150 arrests. Hundreds gathered in Parliament Square, with many defying police warnings by holding signs expressing support for the group, which was banned under the Terrorism Act in July. The Metropolitan Police made arrests for supporting a proscribed organization and assaulting officers, as many protesters followed organizers' instructions to go limp, making their removal more difficult. The event highlights the ongoing tension between protest rights and national security legislation, with critics like Amnesty International calling the arrests of peaceful demonstrators "genuinely shocking."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has ceased providing protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a decision influenced by internal criticism that the assignment diverted officers from crucial crime suppression duties. The security detail was implemented after President Trump revoked Harris's Secret Service protection. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had directed the LAPD to assist the California Highway Patrol with Harris's security on a temporary basis. However, the police union argued that a multimillionaire like Harris could afford private security and that taxpayers should not bear the cost, leading to the withdrawal of LAPD resources from her Brentwood home.</p>

Major cities including Philadelphia and New York City are in the path of storms expected to bring damaging winds, large hail, and lightning. The National Weather Service has issued a Level 2 of 4 flash flood risk for a corridor from Philadelphia to Bridgeport, Connecticut, due to the potential for multiple rounds of heavy, training storms. The severe weather is forecast to begin Saturday afternoon and continue into the overnight hours before a cold front brings cooler, drier air to the region on Sunday.</p>

          <p>The Earwigs, an obscure power pop band from 1980s Orange County, is experiencing a revival after their rare 45 RPM single, "She’s So Naive," became a sought-after collector's item, fetching up to $500 online. Frontman Michael Ubaldini was initially unaware of the record's value, selling personal copies for just $20 before discovering their high price on resale markets. This renewed interest prompted the band to finally release their "lost" 1981 debut album on limited edition vinyl, which sold out two pressings in five days. The band is now playing a reunion show to celebrate their unlikely resurgence, driven by a cult following that kept their music alive for decades.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent deadly strike on a Venezuelan speedboat, which the White House labeled as carrying "narco-terrorists," has significantly heightened tensions in the Caribbean. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the act as "imperialist policy" and announced the activation of over 4.5 million militiamen, while the U.S. has deployed at least eight warships to the region. The U.S. has also designated the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang as a terrorist organization and maintains a $50 million bounty on Maduro. This military action marks a new phase in the U.S. "war on drugs," raising fears of a potential, though unlikely, direct intervention in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>A new chapter of conservation is beginning at California's Point Reyes National seashore, where over 16,000 acres will be restored following a multi-million dollar buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, aims to heal landscapes impacted by decades of ranching by removing invasive plants and reintroducing native species. The five-year restoration plan will controversially use targeted cattle grazing as a tool to manage vegetation, alongside prescribed burns and mowing. While the transition is painful for the multi-generational ranching community, the project is seen as a vital experiment in creating climate-resilient ecosystems and could inform global conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>American farm states are experiencing a significant drop in agricultural exports as the ongoing trade war prompts Beijing to seek alternative suppliers, particularly Brazil. This has created a divide among U.S. farmers: some remain hopeful that President Trump's tough stance will eventually secure better long-term trade deals, while others fear that the crucial Chinese market is being permanently lost. The agricultural trade relationship has long been subject to political volatility, and many in the heartland are skeptical that it can be reliably restored. The situation highlights the precarious position of farmers caught in the middle of international economic disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gulf nations like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are facing growing social friction as they implement economic reforms designed to reduce reliance on oil and public sector jobs. Policies such as "Emiratization" and "Saudization" aim to increase local employment in the private sector, but this push is creating a culture clash as citizens are encouraged to take jobs previously held by migrant workers. Simultaneously, efforts to attract skilled foreign talent by liberalizing social norms are causing unease among conservative locals. This is altering the traditional social contract, where the state provided for its citizens, leading to new tensions between locals and expatriates who are now seen as economic rivals.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated claims about rampant violence in cities like Chicago and Baltimore, an analysis of crime data reveals a different picture. The four U.S. cities with the highest murder rates in 2024 are all located in Republican-led states: Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; St. Louis, Missouri; and Memphis, Tennessee. While Trump threatens to deploy the national guard to Democratic-run cities, violent crime rates have been falling precipitously nationwide, with major declines in many of the urban areas he criticizes. This discrepancy suggests a political motivation behind the President's focus, as he largely ignores higher crime rates in cities within states governed by his political allies.</p>

          <p>Germany's pay-as-you-go pension system, established in 1955 based on the assumption of a high birth rate, is facing a demographic crisis. The retirement of the populous baby boomer generation by 2039 will leave fewer workers to support a growing number of pensioners, straining social security and the economy. In 1962, six employees funded one pensioner; by 2020, the ratio was just 1.8 to one. While politicians have been slow to act, proposals are emerging, including a controversial "Boomer Soli" tax on wealthier retirees. The situation has prompted comparisons to more stable systems in neighboring countries like Austria and the Netherlands, which mandate broader contributions.</p>

The discovery in shallow, hastily dug graves has launched what experts are calling "the ultimate cold case." To identify the forgotten soldiers, who include American, British, and Native American fighters, researchers are employing forensic genealogy, building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones. The team has already generated profiles for two individuals and is asking the public, particularly those with family names like Warfield and Griffith from Maryland, to submit DNA to help restore the identities of these first American soldiers.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has clarified a key promise from his party's conference, stating that he would stop small boat migrant crossings within two weeks of new legislation being passed, not within two weeks of entering government. His plan involves a new "Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill" that would bar asylum claims from anyone arriving illegally and disapply international treaties like the Refugee Convention. When pressed on the timeline for passing such a law, Farage acknowledged it could take time but insisted his government would act as quickly as possible.

This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed.
