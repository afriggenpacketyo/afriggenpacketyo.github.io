          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service following an Instagram post that depicted seashells arranged to form "86 47." Trump supporters interpreted this as a veiled threat against President Trump, with "86" being slang for removal or, controversially, to kill. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, opposing violence of any kind. Trump and administration officials rejected Comey's explanation, with Trump calling Comey a "dirty cop" who was calling for the president's assassination, leading to Homeland Security and FBI involvement.</p>

In New Jersey, a transit strike by locomotive engineers shut down the rail network, impacting commuters traveling to and from New York City. The strike, the first statewide transit strike in over 40 years, stemmed from failed contract negotiations regarding wage parity.

          <p>This article recalls Joe Biden's response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about Biden's mental acuity and memory. Audio recordings from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed instances where Biden struggled to recall key dates and events, including the death of his son Beau. When questioned about the report, Biden asserted his competence and dismissed the special counsel's assessment. The report and subsequent gaffes amplified Republican criticisms about Biden's mental fitness, contributing to later calls from Democrats for him to end his re-election campaign.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and temporarily halted flights at Midway International Airport. The dust storm also impacted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois, coating the area in debris. The National Weather Service noted that dust storm warnings are more common in rural parts of central and southern Illinois.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs's trial hinges on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, who detailed years of alleged abuse and coercion into unwanted sex acts. Ventura's emotional testimony included descriptions of beatings, drug-fueled "freak-offs," and controlling behavior by Combs. Prosecutors aim to demonstrate that Combs ran a criminal, sexual enterprise, charging him with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, all of which he denies. Ventura's account is crucial to building the case, though Combs's attorneys concede abuse but deny sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans, are raising concerns about potential loss of coverage. The cuts are part of a Republican bill to fund President Trump's agenda, which includes major tax breaks. An analysis estimates that millions could lose health insurance due to the cuts. While some Republicans claim the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, many Americans who rely on Medicaid fear they will be forced to choose between health care and necessities.</p>
