          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a decision accelerated by U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The move is expected to create 800 new American jobs in roles like engineering, R&D, and supply chain management. While the company states the reshoring aligns with its long-term strategy of producing goods closer to consumers, executives acknowledged that the tariffs were a key factor in speeding up the timeline for the transition. The new Kentucky plant is projected to be operational by early 2027.</p>

Musk, a major political donor, also called for the formation of a new political party, expressing frustration with what he termed the "PORKY PIG PARTY." His opposition is also linked to provisions in the bill that would roll back clean energy credits, which could negatively impact his company, Tesla.</p>

          <p>The ongoing trade dispute with China is affecting the availability and cost of fireworks for Independence Day celebrations, as over 95% of pyrotechnics sold in the U.S. are imported from China. A 30% tariff has caused supply chain disruptions, with some American importers halting orders earlier in the year when potential tariffs were even higher. Consequently, consumers may face a reduced selection and increased prices for fireworks this year. Major vendors like Phantom Fireworks have indicated that while they will absorb some of the cost, price increases on about a third of their products are likely. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities believe Wess Roley intentionally started a wildfire at Canfield Mountain to lure first responders into an attack that killed two and critically injured a third. After a standoff, Roley was found deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. While a definitive motive remains unknown, investigators are reviewing his background and noted he had no significant criminal history, though family members confirmed his interest in firefighting.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to lift some U.S. financial sanctions against Syria, a move aimed at promoting stability following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The order terminates a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets but keeps other sanctions in place, including those targeting individuals like Assad and those mandated by Congress. The decision was anticipated after President Trump met with Syria's new leader, who argued that sanctions were hindering the transitional government's ability to function. The White House stated the move would help Syria's economic recovery while maintaining pressure on human rights abusers and terrorist-linked entities.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led reconciliation bill includes significant cuts to Medicaid, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting that the Senate version could reduce federal spending by $1 trillion and leave nearly 12 million more people uninsured by 2034. The bill introduces new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients and poses a substantial risk to rural hospitals and community health centers that rely on Medicaid revenue.

According to health news analysts, these cuts could be devastating for rural hospitals, which often operate on thin margins and rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement to stay open.

The order came after the Supreme Court partially stayed nationwide injunctions against the policy, creating legal uncertainty. The judge specifically asked whether the government believes it can begin deporting babies who are not plaintiffs in the current lawsuit before the case is fully resolved. This legal challenge is part of a broader conflict over the administration's immigration policies and the constitutional principle of birthright citizenship established by the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has started the voting process on the massive Republican-backed budget bill, facing a tight self-imposed deadline of July 4th set by President Trump. The legislation, which combines extensive tax cut extensions with significant spending cuts to programs like Medicaid, has been highly divisive. Republicans can only afford a few defections for the bill to pass, and some, like Senator Thom Tillis, have voiced strong opposition to certain provisions. If the bill clears the Senate, it must return to the House for a final vote, where its passage is also uncertain due to opposition from some conservative members over the bill's impact on the national debt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans while financially harming the lowest earners. The report estimates that households in the top 20% of income would see an average annual gain of $5,700, whereas the bottom 20% would experience an income reduction of about $700 per year. This outcome is attributed to the bill's combination of extending tax cuts that favor the rich and imposing sharp spending cuts on programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which assist low-income families.

          <p>Republican Senator Mike Lee has removed a controversial provision from the Senate's budget bill that would have allowed for the sale of public lands in several Western states. Lee stated the withdrawal was due to an inability to secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock. The proposal had faced significant opposition not only from Democrats but also from fellow Republicans in states like Idaho and Montana, as well as from conservation groups. The provision's removal marks a significant change to the bill as it moves through the complex budget reconciliation process.</p>

City data reflects this sentiment, showing a significant year-to-date increase in robberies, burglaries, and auto thefts in the downtown area. In response to the trend, which the mayor has called "unacceptable," the Cincinnati police chief is launching a new task force to proactively target crime hot spots.</p>

          <p>The Senate's draft of the Republican spending bill proposes to eliminate federal tax credits for electric vehicles by September 30th of this year, an even more accelerated timeline than the House version. This potential change has been met with disappointment from EV advocates and some auto dealers, who warn that an abrupt repeal would disrupt the auto market and hinder U.S. competitiveness in the green technology sector. Conversely, groups aligned with the fossil fuel industry have celebrated the move. The provision is still subject to change as the Senate votes on amendments and reconciles its bill with the House.
