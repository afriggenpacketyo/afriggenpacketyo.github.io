          <p>A former Disney World employee, Michael Scheuer, received a three-year prison sentence for hacking into the restaurant menus. Scheuer altered prices, added offensive language, and changed allergen listings, but thankfully none of the changes made it to the public due to their discovery before printing. He pleaded guilty to computer fraud and aggravated identity theft and was ordered to pay $620,000 in restitution to Disney and $70,000 to the software company that provides the menu creation program, highlighting the serious consequences of such cybercrimes.</p>

British and Canadian troops discovered the camp in April 1945, revealing horrific conditions, including thousands of unburied corpses and tens of thousands of emaciated survivors. While other camps were destroyed, Bergen-Belsen remained intact, leaving behind evidence and witnesses to the Nazi's cruelty and incompetence, where approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people died, mostly Jews, due to overcrowding, malnutrition, and disease.</p>

          <p>F.B.I. agents arrested a Milwaukee judge, Hannah Dugan, for allegedly obstructing justice by directing an undocumented immigrant out of her courtroom while federal immigration agents waited to arrest him. The arrest drew condemnation from Democratic leaders and prompted protests, while the U.S. attorney general defended the move as sending a strong message that obstructing justice will be prosecuted. The incident raises concerns about the separation of powers and the role of judges in ensuring access to justice.</p>

          <p>New polls reveal that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump across various key issues. Surveys show declining approval ratings for Trump's handling of the economy, immigration, and trade policies, with a majority describing his second term as "scary". These negative reviews suggest growing public fatigue and concern over the direction of the country under Trump's leadership.</p>

After meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump questioned Vladimir Putin's desire for peace, stating that the recent attacks on civilian areas made him reconsider his position. This potential shift in Trump's perspective could offer new hope for a resolution to the conflict, though his unpredictable nature leaves the outcome uncertain.</p>
