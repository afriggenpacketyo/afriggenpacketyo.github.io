          <p>In response to the deadly floods in Texas Hill Country, a group of over 30 active and former Navy SEALs have volunteered to assist in the difficult search and recovery operations. Leveraging their specialized skills in navigating treacherous terrain and diving, the SEALs are working along the devastated Guadalupe River to locate victims and provide closure for families. The volunteers, partnering with a non-profit organization, have been instrumental in combing through miles of debris and flattened forests. Their efforts represent a significant community-driven response to the large-scale natural disaster.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room is explored in a '48 Hours' report, revealing a violent end to a tumultuous 'throuple' relationship. Investigators connected her death to her boyfriend, Zachary Abell, and his other partner, Christina Araujo, after a road trip filled with jealousy and abuse culminated in a brutal beating. Araujo took a plea deal and testified against Abell, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a life sentence. The case highlights the tragic dynamics of an abusive relationship and the complex investigation that brought Seiden's killers to justice.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration authorities arrested 319 people suspected of being in the country illegally during raids on two licensed cannabis farms in Southern California. The large-scale operation, which also involved criminal warrants for harboring and illegal employment, led to tense standoffs between agents and protesters. During the events, one farm worker died after falling from a greenhouse roof, and several others were injured. Glass House Farms, one of the raided companies, stated it has never knowingly violated hiring laws and is providing legal aid to the detained workers.</p>

This move has reportedly created a sense of unease among career employees at the DOJ, echoing previous purges during the early stages of the Trump presidency.

However, recent global conflicts have renewed interest in the C-17's unique capabilities, sparking discussions about potentially resuming production.

While proponents tout environmental and health benefits, the industry faces significant hurdles, including high initial costs, regulatory approval, and overcoming consumer skepticism about ultra-processed foods.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he plans to resign from his position, following reports of internal conflict over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Speculation arose after the DOJ and FBI released a joint memo concluding their review without revealing a 'client list,' a decision that angered some administration hardliners. In a social media post, Patel affirmed his commitment to serving the president, stating 'the conspiracy theories just aren’t true.' The denial aims to quell talk of a major rift between the FBI and DOJ over the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vast Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a critical source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. The report offers a glimpse into the lives of thousands of miners working under rebel oversight, who tax the mineral extraction to generate significant revenue. This access comes as a fragile ceasefire deal, brokered by the U.S., is in place between DR Congo and Rwanda, with American mineral rights being a key part of the discussions. The situation remains tense, with the M23 rebels not party to the deal and still firmly in control of the lucrative region.</p>

          <p>Despite declining traditional TV viewership in recent years, the reality show 'Love Island' is experiencing a significant resurgence in engagement, largely driven by its presence on TikTok. The show's official social media accounts have gained millions of followers, with short-form clips, recaps, and fan commentary on TikTok receiving massive view counts. This shift in consumption habits allows viewers to keep up with the drama without committing to nightly hour-long episodes. While this boosts the show's overall reach, some express concern that it distorts the viewing experience by presenting contestants through out-of-context, bite-sized clips.</p>

The move is part of a broader tariff strategy impacting numerous U.S. trading partners, escalating global trade tensions and prompting vows of potential countermeasures from the EU.

In California, the most dangerous time is between 8:00 PM and 8:59 PM, while Texas sees its peak between 9:00 PM and 9:59 PM.
