        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has moved forward with the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. The measure seeks to establish industry standards and protect consumers by mandating stablecoin issuers to hold asset reserves and prioritize repayment in case of bankruptcy. While supporters claim it will formalize the crypto industry and foster competition, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren argue it provides weak regulations and fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns, particularly those involving President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. The bill prohibits members of Congress from issuing stablecoins during their public service, but some critics argue it doesn't adequately prevent rewarding Trump coin buyers with favors. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced criticism from Senator Chris Van Hollen during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing regarding the Trump administration's foreign policy and budget priorities. The contentious exchange focused on Rubio's relationship with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant wrongly deported to El Salvador. Van Hollen accused Rubio of making unsubstantiated comments about Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and human trafficking, leading to heated rebuttals. The debate escalated as Van Hollen likened Rubio's deportation policies to McCarthy-era witch hunts, prompting Committee Chairman Jim Risch to intervene. </p>

Doctors said that given Biden's age, it would be within the standard of care for him to have forgone testing in recent years.

While Trump claims the bill eliminates 'waste fraud and abuse,' some Republicans, like Congressman Mike Lawler, remain firm in their opposition due to the proposed changes to Salt deductions.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's misunderstanding of habeas corpus has drawn criticism after she incorrectly described it as a presidential authority to deport individuals during a Senate hearing. This prompted Senator Maggie Hassan to correct her, emphasizing that habeas corpus protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment. Noem's comments have raised concerns about the Trump administration's approach to civil liberties and the rule of law, given the department's vast powers and enforcement capabilities. Noem appears to subscribe to Trumpâ€™s reading of the Constitution. </p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have sharply criticized Israel's threats to escalate the war in Gaza and its blockade of humanitarian aid. Britain has suspended talks on expanding a free-trade agreement with Israel, while the three countries issued a rare joint statement condemning Israel's actions as 'wholly disproportionate.' They warned of 'further concrete actions' if humanitarian access is not restored. The UN has warned that the population is under threat of famine, with a senior U.N. humanitarian official stating that 14,000 babies in Gaza could die in the next 48 hours unless truckloads of aid can enter. </p>

          <p>This article discusses three critical long-term care insurance questions seniors should be asking themselves right now. First, have my retirement savings changed? Second, have my retirement plans changed? Third, should I delay securing a long-term care insurance plan? The article concludes that seniors and older adults often have a limited budget and what can appear to be an unlimited number of items to spend it on, so it's worth researching plans, prices and companies to determine if it makes sense for you.

          <p>Despite aid lorries starting to cross the border into Gaza after an 11-week blockade, the UN reports that no aid has yet been distributed. The UK is suspending trade talks over Israel's "morally unjustifiable" military escalation, and the EU is reviewing its trade agreement with Israel. The UN says the aid operation is made "complex" as Israel requires the UN to "offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, and reload them separately once they secure our teams' access from inside the Gaza Strip". The UN estimates 600 trucks a day are required to begin tackling Gaza's chronic humanitarian crisis. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home electricity bills are expected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high, according to an analysis by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). This increase is attributed to rising electricity costs outpacing inflation, combined with higher temperatures necessitating increased cooling. Low-income households, who already spend a larger share of their income on energy costs, may struggle to afford cooling, potentially leading to health risks. The article recommends that families should start preparing for long-term extreme weather and think about the energy efficiency of their cooling systems. </p>

          <p>The United States suffered its worst commercial honeybee crash on record, with an estimated 62% of colonies perishing. However, the Trump administration's federal funding cuts have scrambled the USDA's response, delaying the identification of the cause and preventing beekeepers from taking preventative measures. The USDA has long been the countryâ€™s frontline response to honeybee die-offs, using its labs to characterize threats to the insects. Without fully funded and staffed USDA labs, experts fear that beekeepers wonâ€™t know why their colonies are dying the next time disaster strikes. </p>

          <p>A team of nearly 100 neurology experts has collaborated to create a new method of evaluating patients with traumatic brain injuries, aiming to improve assessment and treatment. The current Glasgow Coma Scale is deemed insufficient, as it can lead to misdiagnosis and inadequate care. The proposed system incorporates blood biomarkers, scans, and consideration of the patientâ€™s social environment for a more comprehensive assessment. This new classification system will help researchers develop drug treatments and better procedures. </p>

Initially, the show faced some criticism for being aimless, but it has evolved, becoming tighter, funnier, and more meta. With bookings that are savvier and more experimental, 'Everybody's Live' is making a case for risk-taking and novel comedy in the late-night talk show genre. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the ongoing concerns about President Biden's age and fitness for office, particularly in light of a new book, 'Original Sin,' which details his alleged cognitive decline. The author argues that the 'cover-up' of Biden's condition is beside the point because his infirmity is already evident. While Democrats may try to downplay the issue, the public's perception of Biden's age and abilities remains a significant challenge. The article concludes that the story about Biden getting old is itself getting old, but the concerns about his age persist. </p>
