            <p>A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River off Manhattan, resulting in several fatalities. Emergency services responded to the scene near the West Side Highway and Spring Street, where the helicopter was found overturned in the water. Four people were recovered and transported to a hospital, but their conditions were critical, and it was later confirmed that there were multiple deaths. The helicopter was identified as a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger, a model commonly used for tourist flights in the area.

            <p>A recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey poll indicates that the "vibecession" in America is deepening, with financial security slipping further out of reach for individuals across all income brackets. Inflation, high interest rates, and potential layoffs contribute to mounting financial anxiety, impacting household budgets and discretionary spending. While optimism remains for some, a significant portion of Americans are worried about the effects of future economic decline and the impact of tariffs on their personal finances.

            <p>The proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, passed by the House, could create obstacles for married women who have changed their last names, according to experts. The act mandates documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, potentially disenfranchising millions who lack matching birth certificates or passports. Opponents argue the law could also affect military and rural voters, making in-person registration the only viable option for many. While supporters claim the act prevents non-citizen voting, critics point out that such voting is already illegal and rare, raising concerns about voter suppression.</p>

While the market remains risky, retail investors are increasing their exposure, particularly in broad market exchange-traded funds.

            <p>An economist argues that President Trump's tariff increase on imports from China, reaching a cumulative rate of 145%, will effectively end most trade between the two countries. The high tariff rate will make many goods economically unviable, leading companies to seek alternatives. The economist also notes that even with the temporary tariff pause on other countries, the U.S. is still in its most protectionist stance in decades. These tariffs will lead to significant cost increases and an economic hit, potentially leading to the biggest tax increase since 1993. (not investment advice)</p>
