          <p>A Miami-based recycling company called Sneaker Impact is collecting used sneakers from donation boxes across the United States, giving them a new life. The company sorts the shoes for reuse or recycling, depending on their condition. Reusable shoes are shipped to developing countries like Haiti and Honduras to be resold by local businesses, creating microbusiness opportunities. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and repurposed into materials like flooring and sandals. The company aims to reduce waste and promote environmentally friendly business practices, with the founder emphasizing the importance of reuse and upcycling. </p>

          <p>Leaked audio from an interview with special counsel Robert Hur reveals that former President Joe Biden admitted he likely kept a classified document related to Afghanistan after his vice presidency "for posterity's sake." Biden initially claimed he didn't recall why he had the document. The House Judiciary Committee sued Attorney General Merrick Garland for the audio recordings, citing the importance of the "verbal and nonverbal context" given Hur's assessment of Biden as "an elderly man with a poor memory."

The two plants in question are the Oppama plant, which pioneered electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co.

          <p>A four-minute audio clip from President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s 2023 special counsel interview was released, revealing him speaking haltingly and struggling to recall key dates. The audio, published by Axios, is part of the investigation into Mr. Biden’s handling of classified documents. The clip shows Mr. Biden stumbling over the years his son died and Donald J. Trump was first elected. Republicans have long sought to make the recording public, arguing it might offer evidence of a decline in Mr. Biden’s mental acuity.</p>

The facility, once run by a militant group but now managed by the Pakistani government, was one of six sites targeted by Indian missiles and airstrikes. Muhammad Azam, the administrator, asserted that the complex has no ties to militant groups and called for peace and dialogue between India and Pakistan.</p>

The storm caused near-zero visibility on major interstates and led to reports of "mud rain" in some areas. </p>

The iconic funicular railway has faced numerous challenges over the years, including maintenance issues and safety concerns, but remains a historic landmark.</p>

The article explores the collective failure of the Democratic Party to address concerns about Biden's fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Moody's downgraded the United States' credit rating, citing rising debt levels and political gridlock in Washington. This downgrade means that all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the United States their highest rating. Moody's pointed to the failure of successive administrations to address U.S. debt and the rising costs of programs like Social Security and Medicare. The downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and the government. </p>

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the United States' credit rating from AAA to Aa1, citing concerns over rising government debt and interest costs. The downgrade reflects a long-term increase in government debt and interest payment ratios. Moody's expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035. The White House criticized Moody's, blaming the previous administration for the fiscal situation. A lower credit rating typically leads to higher borrowing costs for the country.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security called the story "grossly out of context" and stated that FEMA is "fully activated" in preparation for the season. This comes amid criticism of FEMA's handling of past natural disasters and plans to shift more emergency response duties to the states.</p>
