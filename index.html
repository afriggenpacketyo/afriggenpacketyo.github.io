          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, who is accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. The prosecution's final witness detailed how Routh allegedly conducted surveillance for a month while living out of a gas station before the incident. Prosecutors argue that Routh, who is representing himself, had a methodical plan involving a military-grade weapon and burner phones. He faces five criminal charges, including the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, and plans to call three witnesses for his defense.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military has conducted a third "lethal kinetic strike" on a boat allegedly trafficking narcotics in international waters, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." This action is part of an ongoing series of strikes aimed at disrupting drug flow into the United States, which the administration has linked to designated terrorist organizations. The strikes have drawn criticism from some Democratic lawmakers, who question the legal justification for using military force in this manner and argue it represents a constitutional overreach. The Pentagon has been asked for more details regarding the operation and the vessel's origin.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call. The agreement would reportedly see TikTok's U.S. business sold to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing it to continue operating while using an algorithm licensed from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. However, statements from Chinese state media and ByteDance suggest negotiations are ongoing, with control over the powerful algorithm remaining a key issue. The two leaders also agreed to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old woman who has lived in California for over three decades, has generated significant shock and support from the Sikh community. Kaur, whose asylum application was denied years ago, was detained by ICE during a routine check-in, a move her supporters and some lawmakers call shameful and an example of misplaced priorities. Her family and lawyer state she has been compliant with authorities and that the primary obstacle to her deportation has been the inability to secure travel documents from India. They are now focused on securing her release from the detention facility, citing her age and health conditions.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led short-term funding bill, which passed in the House, failed to advance in the Senate, leaving no clear path to prevent a government shutdown by the October 1 deadline. The measure did not secure the necessary 60 votes as Democrats opposed it, citing Republicans' refusal to negotiate on key priorities like healthcare tax credits. With Congress now in recess, President Trump has acknowledged a shutdown is possible. Senate leaders have indicated they will hold another vote upon their return, but the partisan stalemate places the blame game for a potential shutdown at the forefront of Washington politics.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters for several days. Its current projected track carries it north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the storm could pass east of Bermuda next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island, according to meteorologists.</p>

Siebert's departure raises serious concerns among critics about the politicization of the Justice Department and the use of prosecutorial power for retribution.

Cruz described Carr's public threats to ABC's broadcast license as "dangerous as hell" and compared them to tactics from the movie 'Goodfellas,' where a mobster implies harm to a business. While stating he was glad Kimmel was off the air, Cruz warned that the government regulating media content based on political preference sets a perilous precedent that could ultimately harm conservatives.

Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to submit a revised, more professional complaint that adheres to procedural rules and does not exceed 40 pages.

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses of critical TV networks have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. This article explains that networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC require licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use public airwaves, obligating them to operate in the "public interest." While the FCC can theoretically revoke a license, the process is complex and typically involves issues like obscenity or children's programming, not political content. The current pressure is seen by experts as an unprecedented use of this regulatory authority.</p>

          <p>A recent surge of multi-billion-pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is bolstering the United Kingdom's ambition to become an AI superpower. This influx of capital, celebrated during President Trump's state visit, is seen as a sign of strong confidence from Silicon Valley in the UK's research and development capabilities. While some critics, like Sir Nick Clegg, warn of the UK becoming too dependent on U.S. tech, others see it as a pivotal opportunity to grow the economy. The investments are focused on AI infrastructure and research, primarily within the Oxford-Cambridge-London "Golden Triangle."</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse approximately 100 protesters outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago. Demonstrators, including two Democratic congressional candidates, were attempting to block government vehicles during a protest against an immigration crackdown dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz." At least three people were arrested during the clashes, which participants described as a "violent abuse of power." The Department of Homeland Security defended the actions, stating that impeding ICE operations sides with criminal cartels and human traffickers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests as it faces pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on demonstrations. The guidelines, which were developed after the pro-Palestinian encampment last spring, ban unauthorized overnight protests in key areas like Royce Quad but also expand designated free speech zones. While some rules align with federal demands, others, such as allowing pre-approved overnight events, diverge. University officials state the policies are content-neutral and aim to balance free expression with campus safety, though some student leaders worry they are too broad and restrictive.</p>

Upon their arrival in the capital, the marchers were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, to whom they presented a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children.

          <p>The independent comedy show "Pupusas and Punchlines," held in a Los Angeles Salvadoran restaurant, has become a vital hub for Latinx comedians. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the weekly event offers a rare and welcoming space for performers to connect with an appreciative audience over shared food and culture. In a competitive scene where Latinx comics often feel marginalized, the show provides a platform to joke about the immigrant experience and build community. Its consistent sell-out crowds demonstrate a strong demand for comedy that reflects the city's diverse population.</p>
