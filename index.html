          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a rare, large-scale meeting of generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia, on short notice. The purpose of the meeting is not fully disclosed, but it follows Hegseth's earlier proposals to reduce the number of high-ranking officers. Speculation suggests he might address the National Defense Strategy, which is expected to emphasize homeland defense more heavily. This unusual gathering highlights ongoing shifts within the military leadership under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook are urging the Supreme Court to block President Trump's attempt to fire her, arguing it would undermine the Fed's independence. Trump seeks to remove Cook over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, linking the timing to his criticism of the Fed's interest rate policies. A group of former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries also supported Cook, emphasizing the importance of judicial review for "for cause" removals to protect the institution's autonomy. The high-stakes legal battle could set a significant precedent for presidential authority over independent agencies.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has turned the tables on Democratic leaders, using their past warnings about government shutdowns to criticize their current stance on federal funding. Johnson claims Democrats are threatening a shutdown by demanding the repeal of a tax cut, restoration of healthcare for undocumented immigrants, and funding for specific media outlets. With a potential shutdown looming on October 1, both parties are engaging in a blame game, each accusing the other of intransigence and jeopardizing essential government services. The political standoff highlights deep divisions over spending priorities and the consequences of failing to reach a bipartisan agreement.</p>

          <h2>U.S. New Car Sales See Unexpected Rise Amid Consumer Fears of Tariffs and Price Hikes</h2>

          <p>U.S. new car sales have experienced an unexpected boost, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 forecast to 16.1 million vehicles. This surge is attributed to consumers accelerating purchases due to fears of impending tariffs and higher prices, along with the imminent expiration of federal EV tax credits. While beneficial for the auto industry in the short term, analysts anticipate a slowdown in the fourth quarter and next year as these factors dissipate. Major automakers like General Motors, Toyota, and Hyundai have seen market share gains, while smaller brands and Tesla have experienced declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CarMax stock plunged 20% after the used auto retailer reported quarterly earnings and revenue below Wall Street's expectations, reaching its lowest price in over five years. CEO Bill Nash described the quarter as "challenging," citing shifting market conditions, a pull-ahead in sales due to earlier tariff fears, and inventory depreciation. This performance impacted other car retailers, whose shares also fell, as CarMax's results often serve as an early indicator for the broader automotive retail sector. The company aims to improve its inventory and pricing strategy in the upcoming quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol revealed plans to close underperforming locations and eliminate 900 non-retail jobs as part of a $1 billion "Back to Starbucks" revitalization strategy.

While Starbucks remains profitable, sales have slowed amid increased competition. The company expects its overall store count in North America to slightly decline in fiscal year 2025, with approximately 500 locations likely to be shuttered in the current quarter.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified Joshua Jahn, 29, as the suspect in the Dallas ICE facility shooting, stating he acted alone and was driven by "definitively anti-ICE" and anti-federal government sentiments.

The attack, which killed one detainee and injured two others, involved significant pre-planning, including tracking ICE agents and obtaining a list of DHS facilities.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average interest rate on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.88%, a 17-basis-point drop in one week. This makes HELOCs one of the most affordable borrowing options currently available, especially for homeowners with substantial equity. Experts suggest it's a good time to open a HELOC because rates could fall further, and the variable rate allows borrowers to benefit from future cuts without refinancing. Additionally, the option for interest-only payments during the initial draw period offers financial flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

While proponents highlight ethical concerns and potential for new technologies like AI modeling, some medical experts and patient advocates express concern.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian politicians have reacted to President Trump's surprising shift in rhetoric, where he stated Ukraine could "take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!" Zelenskyy expressed positive surprise, seeing it as a signal of continued U.S. support. However, some Ukrainian parliamentarians remain cautious, suggesting Trump's comments might reflect a desire to disengage or a realization that Russia is unwilling to compromise. The change in tone is seen by some as a potential opening for increased weapon sales to Europe and economic pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>The National Personnel Records Center, a branch of the National Archives, mistakenly released a largely unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military record to an ally of her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. This disclosure, which included sensitive personal information like her Social Security number and home addresses, potentially violates privacy laws. The Archives admitted a technician failed to follow standard procedures and apologized, launching an internal review and alerting the Inspector General. Sherrill condemned the act as an illegal weaponization of her records for political gain, sparking calls for a criminal investigation.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders in Congress have dismissed the White House's threat of large-scale federal worker layoffs due to a government shutdown as an "intimidation" tactic. The White House Office of Management and Budget had advised agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices if funding isn't extended by the October 1 deadline. Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accuse the Trump administration of trying to scare federal workers while they push for key healthcare priorities in funding negotiations.

          <p>With recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, the monthly cost of a $75,000 home equity loan has decreased, making it a more attractive borrowing option. For example, a 10-year loan at 8.34% would cost $923.49 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be $725.86. These rates are lower than earlier in the year and last fall, providing homeowners with significant equity a cheaper way to finance various expenses.

This call came during a White House meeting where Erdogan sought to lift U.S. sanctions and secure a deal for F-35 fighter jets, from which Turkey was expelled in 2019 after acquiring Russian air defense systems. While Trump expressed optimism about future agreements, no firm commitments were made.

Surprisingly, President Trump also endorsed NATO countries shooting down Russian jets.
