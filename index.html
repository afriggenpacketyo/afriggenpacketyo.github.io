            <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Garcia, accused of gang ties but never charged, was deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison. The court's order requires the administration to explain steps taken to free Garcia, but also suggests a lower court may have overstepped its authority. The Justice Department has struggled to provide information about Garcia's whereabouts, leading to accusations of obstruction. The case highlights tensions between executive power and judicial oversight in immigration matters.</p>

            <p>General Motors is reducing production of its BrightDrop electric delivery vans at its CAMI plant in Ontario, Canada, leading to the elimination of 500 jobs and a 20-week shutdown. The company cites market demand and inventory rebalancing as the reasons for the adjustment, denying any connection to President Trump's tariffs. The Canadian union Unifor has criticized the move as a blow to working families. GM had launched BrightDrop as a subsidiary in 2021, integrating it into Chevrolet in 2024, but now faces challenges in scaling production to meet market needs.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield has surged above 4.5%, reflecting investor concerns over President Trump's trade policies.

            <p>Analysts estimate that producing an iPhone in the United States would significantly increase its cost due to higher labor expenses and supply chain challenges. While President Trump believes it's possible, experts cite the lack of a skilled workforce and the need to import components as major obstacles. Some suggest an American-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500. Despite these challenges, Apple has made some investments in U.S. manufacturing, signaling a willingness to engage with the administration.</p>
