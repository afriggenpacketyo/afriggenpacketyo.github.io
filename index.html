          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, is back in the United States to face smuggling charges. His lawyer dismisses the charges as baseless, claiming they stem from coerced statements. The US Supreme Court had previously ordered Trump to facilitate Garcia's return after acknowledging an administrative error. Garcia's case has become a symbol of tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary, with Democrats and immigrant rights groups advocating for his release and due process rights.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize economic relations with Beijing. This shift follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential recalibration of Seoul's foreign policy. While Lee's party is considered more friendly toward China and North Korea, continuity is expected in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan. Under Yoon, Seoul emphasized its commitment to the US alliance and stronger cooperation with Washington and Tokyo.</p>

          <p>MI5 provided false information to its watchdog, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), regarding the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent. This led IPCO to rewrite a report, omitting findings that contradicted MI5's false evidence given in court. MI5 Director General Sir Ken McCallum has since apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements. The revelation raises concerns about MI5's accountability and IPCO's ability to effectively oversee the Security Service.</p>
