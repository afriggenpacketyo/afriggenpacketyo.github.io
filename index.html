          <p>Major medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, are voicing deep concern over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This independent panel of primary care experts has provided trusted, evidence-based guidelines for disease prevention, such as cancer screenings and managing chronic conditions, for 40 years. The potential dismissal follows a similar move with a CDC vaccine advisory committee, raising fears of political interference that could undermine public trust in crucial health recommendations and affect insurance coverage mandated by the Affordable Care Act.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major long-term contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors, boosting its stock price by over 2%. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, is with an undisclosed counterparty who requested anonymity to protect trade secrets. This significant contract comes as Samsung's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, has been facing weak orders and struggling to compete in the high-demand market for advanced AI memory chips. The company advised investors to be cautious due to the confidential nature of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect dropped a bag on the sidewalk, prompting a response from the Metropolitan Police Department’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team, which cleared the item as safe. The individual was transported to a hospital for a medical evaluation and will face charges for unlawful entry and a separate fugitive from justice warrant. This incident occurs amid heightened security concerns following past assassination attempts on President Trump.</p>

          <p>Japan's traditionally stable political landscape is experiencing a significant shift with the rise of the far-right Sanseito party, which recently increased its parliamentary seats from one to fifteen. The party's "Japanese First" slogan, echoing Trump's rhetoric, has resonated with voters frustrated by economic struggles, inflation, and stagnant wages. This discontent is compounded by rising anti-immigrant and anti-tourist sentiment, as Japan sees record numbers of foreign visitors and residents. Analysts suggest this populist surge challenges the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party and reflects a growing desire for political change among the Japanese populace.</p>

While Project 2025 advocates for limiting the Fed's mandate to stable money, Vought emphasized that the administration's focus is on Powell's management and interest rate policy.

          <p>The Israeli military has started a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in populated areas of Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid. This measure is intended to create secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address a severe hunger crisis, as food experts have warned of a looming famine. While the UN welcomed the move, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need. The pause began amid ongoing Israeli military operations in other parts of the territory.</p>

          <p>Google has admitted that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to function correctly during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which killed over 55,000 people. The system should have sent a high-level "Take Action" warning to ten million people near the epicenter, providing up to 35 seconds of notice, but only 469 such alerts were delivered. Researchers cited limitations in the detection algorithms, which severely underestimated the quake's magnitude. Google has since updated its algorithm, stating that a simulation with the new system would have correctly sent alerts to all ten million users.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his witty and incisive songs in the 1950s and '60s, has passed away at the age of 97. A Harvard-educated mathematician, Lehrer led a dual life, famously writing and performing darkly comedic songs that targeted politics, nuclear war, and social conventions. His work on the NBC show "That Was The Week That Was" and his popular records influenced generations of comedy songwriters, including "Weird Al" Yankovic. Lehrer retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his academic career, teaching mathematics for many years.</p>

Sgt. Greg Gillespie and PC Luke Holden described confronting the 17-year-old attacker, who had just killed three young girls and wounded several others at a dance workshop. The officers, who have since been recognized for their bravery, went in "shoulder to shoulder," knowing only that a child had been stabbed and the offender was still inside, ultimately leading to the killer's apprehension.</p>

          <p>The ancient archeological site of Keeladi in Tamil Nadu, India, has become a center of political and historical debate. Excavations have uncovered a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts dating to 580 BCE, which some experts claim challenges the traditional narrative of northern India being the sole cradle of early subcontinent civilization. The findings, particularly Tamil Brahmi script that may predate the northern Ashokan script, have fueled regional pride and intensified the north-south cultural divide. The controversy has been heightened by accusations that the federal government is attempting to suppress the findings.</p>

          <p>Police in Chelan County, Washington, are scaling back the extensive manhunt for Travis Decker, a Pewaukee, Wisconsin native suspected of murdering his three young daughters. The girls, aged 5, 8, and 9, were found dead in early June after Decker failed to return them to their mother. Despite comprehensive searches of the wilderness area using K-9 units, aircraft, and ground teams, a decrease in leads has prompted a reduction in the search footprint. An arrest warrant for Decker on murder and kidnapping charges remains active, and it is unknown if he is still alive.</p>

          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina are facing a crisis as the new government under President Javier Milei implements sweeping budget cuts and mass layoffs. Agencies dedicated to documenting the crimes of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship, such as the National Archive of Remembrance, have seen their staff decimated. The renowned Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, which uses DNA to find children stolen during the dictatorship, has had its government subsidies cut off. These actions have sparked protests and fears that decades of progress in truth, memory, and justice are being deliberately dismantled.</p>

          <p>An investigation led by an Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights" in the 1970s. During these flights, political prisoners were drugged and thrown alive into the Atlantic Ocean. By finding the plane in the U.S. and obtaining its flight logs, the investigators uncovered documented proof of these atrocities, linking specific flights to the disappearance of a group of activists and nuns. This evidence was crucial in a landmark 2017 trial that convicted dozens of officials for crimes against humanity.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory over teammate Lando Norris at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the fine margins in their championship battle. Piastri secured the win by making a brave move through Eau Rouge on the first lap to take the lead, a strategic advantage at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. While Norris was on more durable hard tires, Piastri skillfully managed his medium-compound tires to the finish. The race analysis suggests that a few small errors from Norris, including a suboptimal restart and minor mistakes during his chase, may have cost him a chance to challenge for the lead in the final laps.</p>

          <p>Despite Honeywell reporting positive earnings and raising its future guidance, the company's stock experienced a significant drop, a trend that has frustrated some market observers this earnings season. An analyst suggests the decline could be due to factors like the complexity of its upcoming three-way split, a lack of direct data center exposure, or general market impatience. The analyst argues that the negative reaction is overblown and that the company's fundamentals in aerospace, automation, and advanced materials remain strong, presenting a potential buying opportunity.
