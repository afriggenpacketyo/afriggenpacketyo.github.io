          <p>At least 85 Palestinians were killed while attempting to access humanitarian aid across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, where a UN convoy was met by large crowds that came under gunfire. While witnesses reported that the Israeli military fired into the crowd, the Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to remove an immediate threat. The event underscores the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and escalating violence surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing the challenges of climate change as it experiences increasingly frequent and intense heat waves, with temperatures soaring close to 40°C. In response, authorities are focusing on public information campaigns and preparing for related threats like wildfires, while medical professionals warn of serious health risks. Despite the dangers, the article notes that air conditioning remains uncommon in German homes, partly due to high electricity costs. This highlights a growing need for national adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable populations and workers.</p>

          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens achieved his first-ever Tour de France stage victory, winning stage 15 with a solo breakaway. The 34-year-old, who typically serves as a support rider for race leader Tadej Pogacar, was given the freedom to attack on the hilly route to Carcassonne. Wellens capitalized on the opportunity, breaking away from a lead group on the final climb and holding his advantage to the finish line, marking a special moment in his professional cycling career.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to halve the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030, responding to public fury over the pollution of the nation's rivers and coastlines. This marks the first time the government has set a specific target on spill numbers. The announcement follows recently published data showing that serious pollution incidents from water companies in England rose by 60% in 2024 to the highest number on record, intensifying scrutiny of the sector's performance and regulation.</p>

          <p>While companies often cite "restructuring" or "optimization" for recent layoffs, experts suspect that the adoption of artificial intelligence is a larger, unstated factor. Firms may be strategically using vague language to avoid public and employee backlash while replacing human roles in areas like customer service, content, and HR with increasingly capable AI tools. This approach allows companies to reshape their workforce and cut costs without explicitly admitting to job displacement by automation, a trend that is expected to accelerate.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has shifted to a notably more aggressive and confrontational social media strategy, directly targeting President Trump and his allies with sharp, sometimes crude language and memes. This pivot from the traditional Democratic motto of "when they go low, we go high" is a deliberate tactic, according to Newsom's aides, aimed at punching back against what they describe as bullying and misinformation. The new approach has significantly boosted the governor's online engagement and signals a new paradigm in left-wing political communication.</p>
