          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving a life sentence for murdering her two children, has been found guilty of conspiring to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Prosecutors argued that Daybell schemed with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill Vallow for his $1 million life insurance policy, marrying Chad Daybell four months after the shooting. The prosecution presented evidence suggesting Daybell used twisted religious beliefs to justify the murder, claiming Vallow was possessed by an evil spirit. Daybell faces sentencing in this case and another trial for allegedly conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previous criticisms and calls for lower interest rates. This statement comes after Trump publicly labeled Powell a "major loser" and urged the central bank to cut rates more aggressively to stimulate economic growth. Trump's stance on interest rates contrasts with Powell's cautious approach, citing economic "uncertainty" and potential inflationary pressures from Trump's tariffs. Concerns have arisen about the Federal Reserve's independence amidst Trump's repeated attacks on Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, collaborating with the FDA and food companies. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the industry to eliminate six other dyes commonly found in cereals, snacks, and yogurts. This initiative follows previous efforts to ban Red No. 3 due to cancer concerns, and the FDA is also looking to approve four new natural color additives. While the food industry has expressed concerns about the timeline, consumer groups have signaled support for the change.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that high tariffs on goods from China will be reduced “substantially, but it won’t be zero,” following comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the unsustainability of current tariffs.

Despite the high tariffs, Trump expressed a desire for a positive relationship with China, while also maintaining pressure on other nations to reduce trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter profits have fallen sharply, impacted by a backlash against Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The company reported a 71% drop in quarterly profits, leading Musk to announce plans to reduce his work for the administration in May to focus on Tesla. Protests and attacks on Tesla showrooms have contributed to the company's challenges. Musk's work at DOGE involves dismantling government agencies and implementing cost-cutting measures.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the restoration of Voice of America's worldwide news programming, more than a month after it was effectively shut down by the Trump administration. The judge sided with VOA employees, finding that the administration's actions likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act.

Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a "national standard and timeline for the industry" to voluntarily make the switch.</p>

          <p>Six top policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are jointly lobbying the Trump administration against 25% tariffs on auto parts, warning that the levies could jeopardize U.S. automotive production.

They caution that the failure of even one supplier could lead to shutdowns of automakers' production lines, impacting the entire industry and resulting in job losses.</p>
