            <p>A recent surge in scams involves fraudsters using fake banking apps that mimic legitimate platforms to deceive sellers during in-person transactions. Victims like Anthony Rudd and John Reddock lost valuable tools and a gold bracelet, respectively, after scammers showed them fake 'successful payment' notifications. The apps, sometimes available outside official app stores, create a false sense of security, highlighting the need for increased vigilance and caution when accepting bank transfers in person. UK Finance advises sellers to verify payments in their accounts before handing over goods and to be wary of buyers with newly registered profiles.</p>

            <p>China has announced it will no longer focus on tariffing goods in its trade dispute with the U.S., deeming further increases by the U.S. a 'meaningless numbers game'. Instead, China is implementing non-tariff measures targeting the American services sector, widening export controls on rare-earth minerals, and initiating antitrust probes into American companies. These measures include restricting U.S. access to critical minerals essential for various industries and urging domestic users to replace American technology with Chinese alternatives. This strategic shift signals a more comprehensive approach to retaliation, potentially leading to further decoupling of the two economies.</p>

            <p>Dr. Kevin Hall, a top researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has resigned, accusing aides to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This followed a study finding that ultra-processed foods may not be addictive in the same way as drugs, which contradicted a preconceived narrative.

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that he was denied the opportunity to visit Kilmar Ábrego García, a constituent wrongly deported to El Salvador. The senator condemned the 'unjust situation' and claimed that El Salvador's government could not provide evidence of Abrego Garcia's involvement with MS-13. This incident has intensified scrutiny of the Trump administration's deportation policies and raised concerns about due process. The senator's efforts to advocate for his constituent's return underscore the ongoing controversy surrounding the case.</p>

            <p>Despite initial promises to rectify cuts to foreign aid, the Trump administration has reportedly doubled down on its decision to halt emergency food shipments to millions of starving children in countries like Bangladesh and Somalia. This decision has resulted in the cancellation of contracts with companies producing lifesaving peanut paste, leaving vast quantities of food stuck in warehouses. Experts warn that without urgent intervention, many of these children face imminent death. The situation raises serious concerns about the administration's commitment to humanitarian aid and the devastating consequences of these funding cuts.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced new studies into environmental factors potentially linked to rising autism rates, dismissing the idea that improved diagnoses are the primary cause. Kennedy emphasized his determination to find the 'environmental exposures' behind the increase and directed the NIH to investigate various factors. While experts acknowledge the rise in autism diagnoses and the potential role of environmental factors, they also highlight the expanding definition of autism as a significant contributor. Kennedy's comments have drawn criticism from autism advocacy groups, who argue that his focus on environmental toxins distracts from the real needs of autistic individuals and their families.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who the Trump administration admits was mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador. While the administration acknowledges the error, they allege ties to the MS-13 gang, a claim disputed by the judge. This case has ignited debate over immigration policy and due process, with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele refusing to allow Ábrego García's return. The situation underscores the complexities and controversies surrounding immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>Japan's export growth fell short of expectations in March, rising only 3.9% year-on-year as tariffs began to bite. While the data doesn't fully reflect President Donald Trump's tariff impact, it signals potential economic headwinds. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on auto imports and steel/aluminum, though "reciprocal" tariffs on Japan have been temporarily suspended. These trade dynamics are occurring amid ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S., adding uncertainty to the economic outlook. Some analysts suggest Japan is losing its export dominance to China.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs. The lawsuit argues that enacting such tariffs requires Congressional approval and that the tariffs are unlawful under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Newsom stated that California, as a major exporter, will be disproportionately impacted by the tariffs, which have already resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage. This action makes California the first U.S. state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs.</p>

His fastball velocity was slightly down, but Kershaw expressed satisfaction with his overall performance. His return will further complicate the Dodgers starting rotation.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and slower economic growth. Powell reiterated that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and that the Fed is prepared to wait for greater clarity on their impact before making changes to interest rates. The Fed faces a potentially "challenging scenario" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy. This uncertainty has led to speculation about whether the Fed will cut interest rates to calm investors.</p>
