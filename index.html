          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles following large-scale protests sparked by ICE operations. Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, stating that local authorities can handle the situation. The deployment is authorized under Title 10, allowing the president to use federal troops for law enforcement, a waiver of the Posse Comitatus Act. Protests erupted after ICE conducted raids in multiple locations, leading to numerous arrests and clashes between protesters and authorities. The situation remains tense, with conflicting views between federal and state officials on the necessity and appropriateness of the National Guard deployment.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's alleged self-dealing, including a significant increase in personal wealth and the flow of foreign money into his businesses, poses a fundamental danger to the American political system. The author draws parallels to authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban, who have allegedly used their positions to enrich themselves and their associates. The piece suggests that such actions erode ethical frameworks and weaken checks and balances, transforming the political system into one that serves personal interests rather than the public good. The author expresses concern that the United States is becoming another country with a corrupt leader exploiting power for personal gain.</p>

          <p>President Trump is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, bypassing consultation with California's Governor Newsom. Newsom criticized the move as "sowing chaos," while Trump's administration defends it as necessary to enforce the law. Defense Secretary Hegseth threatened to mobilize active-duty Marines, further escalating tensions. The deployment reflects a widening divide between California's political leaders and the federal government on immigration policy and the use of federal force.</p>
