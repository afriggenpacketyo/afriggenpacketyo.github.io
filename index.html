          <p>A Chinese military drone factory has implemented robots to replace master technicians in the drilling process, significantly improving precision and efficiency. The robots, equipped with real-time sensors, mimic human touch and adjust pressure for perfect vertical holes and countersinks. This technological advancement has reduced the margin of error to a mere 0.04-0.1mm, doubling the production speed and eliminating quality rejects. This shift reflects a global military trend towards unmanned and intelligent operations, challenging traditional "Made in China" stereotypes.</p>

Crypto exchange Coinbase recently benefited from such an inclusion, experiencing a significant stock surge.

          <p>Mark Gordon, on trial with Constance Marten over the death of their newborn baby, described the prosecution's case as resembling "a script from a movie." Gordon, representing himself after his lawyers withdrew, rejected allegations that their baby died of hypothermia during a camping trip. He maintained that they were experienced campers and that the prosecution had fabricated evidence. Victoria's decomposed body was found in a shopping bag in an allotment shed in Brighton in March 2023.</p>
