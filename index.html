          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, rapidly intensified into a formidable Category 5 storm before slightly weakening to a Category 4. The storm is currently undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary fluctuations in intensity but may result in it re-strengthening. While not forecast to directly impact the United States, Erin is passing north of the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico, bringing risks of heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and dangerous surf conditions to the region. Authorities have issued tropical storm watches for several islands and are urging residents to monitor the hurricane's progress closely.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," was convicted for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s, a case that remained cold for over two decades. Investigators linked Miller to the crimes using DNA and genetic genealogy, leading to an elaborate undercover operation to obtain a direct DNA sample. Miller's defense admitted he was the killer but argued for insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother created a violent alternate personality. The judge ultimately rejected this defense, sentencing him to death for the brutal sexual assaults and murders.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi has reportedly been called off as trade relations between the two countries deteriorate. Tensions have escalated following President Trump's imposition of a 25% tariff on Indian exports, with an additional 25% duty expected in response to India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India, which considers the U.S. its largest export partner, has criticized the tariffs as unfair, highlighting that European nations also continue to trade with Russia. The cumulative 50% tariff rate is among the highest the U.S. has placed on any trading partner. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is framed as a response to a declared crime emergency, although local data shows a decline in violent crime. The deployment has been met with protests from residents and criticism from veterans' groups, who view it as a political mission that pulls troops away from their core duties.</p>

In his absence, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett delivered a strong performance, throwing for 324 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winning pass. Bennett's development is becoming increasingly critical as Stafford's injury situation remains unresolved.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, stating it is more than a regular protest group. She cited incidents of alleged violent disorder and aggravated burglary for which the group has claimed responsibility. This defense comes as the Metropolitan Police announced that an additional 60 people will be prosecuted for supporting the group, bringing the total number of arrests to over 700 since the ban was enacted. Rights groups like Amnesty International have criticized the ban and subsequent arrests as disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota mechanic, Chad Volk, discovered a wallet that had been lost for 11 years inside the engine bay of a 2015 Ford Edge. The wallet belonged to Richard Guilford, a retired Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan, who had lost it while working on the vehicle's electrical systems back in 2014. Volk found Guilford through Facebook and mailed the wallet back to him, remarkably with $15 in cash and $250 in still-valid Cabela's gift cards inside. The vehicle had traveled over 150,000 miles with the wallet hidden under its airbox before the chance discovery during a repair.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a novel 'scissor wing' design, a concept once explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to 45 degrees at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the fuselage at hypersonic speeds, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient 'waverider'. This innovative design aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of flying at both subsonic and hypersonic speeds.</p>

The investigation began after a business partner grew suspicious when a package of potassium cyanide arrived at the dental office.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, risk everything for an affair. These triggers include a lifelong pressure to always be 'good' and follow societal expectations, which can lead to a midlife void. Other factors are the burnout from perfectionism, often rooted in trauma; having poor boundaries from being parentified as a child; and being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage. Finally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating one's life and priorities, making boundaries more permeable.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin's explosive growth from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane is a clear example of rapid intensification, a process where a storm's wind speeds increase by more than 58 mph in 24 hours.

Climate change is making such events more common by heating the oceans, which fuel stronger storms.

However, policy uncertainty creates significant business risks, as exemplified by one electronics company that had to suspend its U.S. operations for nearly two months earlier in the year when trade relations soured.

          <p>Air Canada was forced to suspend all operations after more than 10,000 flight attendants went on strike, leaving over 100,000 travelers stranded globally during the peak summer season. The strike began after contract negotiations with the Canadian Union of Public Employees broke down over issues of pay and unpaid work hours. In response, the Canadian government quickly intervened, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve the dispute and ordering the flight attendants back to work. The union criticized the move as a violation of their right to take job action.</p>

          <p>A homeless man in Washington D.C., Bill Theodie, was forced to move from his encampment after President Trump posted a photo of him on social media as part of a new federal crackdown on homelessness. Trump's post, which called for the immediate removal of the unhoused, was followed by an official announcement and the swift clearing of the encampment by city officials and a bulldozer. Theodie, who had lived at the site for years, expressed his frustration at being used as a political tool. The incident highlights the human impact of the administration's policy to clear encampments, offering shelter or threatening fines and jail time.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has remained in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter and protracted legal feud within his family. Following his death in 2013, his sons from his first marriage accused his second wife and their daughters of poisoning him to inherit his estate, a claim they deny. This led to a court-ordered exhumation and a decade-long inquest. A magistrate has now ruled that the cause of death cannot be determined due to decomposition, ordering the body released to the family for reburial, which is likely to spark further disputes over his final resting place.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students in the UK have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in March 2021, just as they were returning to school after a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown. The letters captured their fears about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from whether they would still need face masks to if they had a girlfriend yet. The exercise, organized by their teacher, served as a poignant reflection on their disrupted secondary school journey. Four years later, the students are now receiving their exam results, with many still holding onto the same ambitions.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the children affected by the war in Ukraine. While officials stated the letter raised the issue of child abductions by Russia, the released text is more poetic, speaking of children's universal dreams for safety and urging Putin to "restore their melodic laughter." The letter does not explicitly mention the abductions, for which Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court. Ukrainian officials nevertheless expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the issue of forcibly deported children.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a Chilean town that was once a secretive German religious colony called Colonia Dignidad, now operates as a tourist destination with a hotel and restaurant. The site has a dark past of child sexual abuse and serving as a torture center for political prisoners during the Pinochet dictatorship. The Chilean government's plan to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the victims has divided the community. While victims' families support the memorial, some current residents, who were also victims of the colony's abusive leader, oppose the plan as it includes their homes and businesses.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, moving beyond Westernized dishes like chow mein to offer authentic, diverse regional cuisines from areas like Hunan, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang. These brands, which first test their concepts in multicultural hubs like Singapore, are leveraging sophisticated supply chains and marketing to introduce the world to the vastness of Chinese gastronomy. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a form of soft power or "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially helping to soften China's image on the world stage by showcasing its rich cultural heritage through food.</p>

          <p>A new box set, "Sunset Boulevard," chronicles the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity before his death in 1977. This period includes his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded amidst his divorce from Priscilla Presley. The collection also sheds light on a pivotal moment of disappointment when Presley lost the co-starring role in "A Star Is Born" to Kris Kristofferson.

          <p>During his summit with Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly demanded control over Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a condition for ending the war. In exchange, Putin allegedly offered to relinquish other Ukrainian territories currently held by Russian forces. Reports suggest Trump is supportive of the proposal and is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss the path forward. Zelenskyy has previously stated he would not formally cede any Ukrainian territory, creating a complex diplomatic challenge as the U.S. shifts its focus toward a permanent peace settlement.</p>
