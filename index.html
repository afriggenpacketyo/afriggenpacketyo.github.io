          <p>This article posits that the media's intense focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case is overshadowing more critical, long-term global challenges. It identifies four such issues deserving of greater attention: the escalating U.S. national debt, a resurgent global hunger crisis, the transformative effects of worldwide population decline, and the degradation of America's military readiness. The piece argues that while the Epstein story is significant, these other 'boring' but vital topics will have a far greater impact on the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine engaged in widespread overnight aerial attacks, leading to casualties in both nations. In Ukraine, Russian strikes targeted the Dnipro, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions, resulting in at least two deaths, numerous injuries, and damage to residential and commercial buildings. Concurrently, Ukrainian drones targeted several Russian regions, with officials in Rostov reporting two fatalities from an attack. Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed to have intercepted over 50 Ukrainian drones across multiple areas, highlighting the escalating and reciprocal nature of the conflict's aerial dimension.</p>

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, with many casualties occurring as people awaited aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. This violence coincides with a standstill in ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, exacerbating the dire humanitarian situation as the UN warns of famine. International pressure is mounting on Israel to alleviate the crisis, while aid organizations struggle to provide food amid military restrictions and looting. The incident underscores the desperation and danger faced by civilians seeking essential supplies in the war-torn enclave.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged the legality of the city's sanctuary policies. Judge Lindsay Jenkins, a Biden appointee, ruled that Chicago's ordinances, which limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, are lawful and do not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The Justice Department had argued these policies unlawfully interfere with federal authority and aimed to compel cooperation with its immigration crackdown. Chicago's mayor praised the ruling, stating it affirms the city's right to prioritize local public safety needs over federal immigration agendas.</p>

The bounties target 19 people accused of violating Beijing's national security law.

The campus was temporarily closed and students were asked to shelter in place as state police investigated.

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, and this outcome signals continued political headwinds for President Lai Ching-te's administration. Supporters of the recall were angered by the opposition's blocking of key legislation and passing of controversial reforms seen as favoring China, while the KMT framed the effort as political retaliation undermining democracy.</p>

This is the second time this year the institute has been placed on a suspension list, previously being disqualified from a major project bid.

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, conditions in the country have deteriorated, according to analysts and citizens. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification, has overseen a period of increased job losses, particularly in the NGO sector, and a crackdown on civil liberties. Human rights groups report that freedom of expression has been severely curtailed, with opposition figures and journalists targeted. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly distant, deepening the country's political and social challenges.</p>

According to recent studies, one in five teenagers reports feeling lonely, a condition that can impact school performance and mental health. Sociologists warn that this isolation can also make young people more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. The problem is not confined to urban areas, as research indicates that a lack of social opportunities in rural regions also increases the risk of loneliness, which in turn can foster resentment and negatively impact perceptions of community.</p>

His ability to merge street culture with mainstream luxury seemed to offer a new model for success and authenticity.

          <p>The Trump administration is pursuing a policy of direct state intervention in private companies at a scale not typically seen outside of major crises, marking a shift for the Republican party. This approach includes President Trump personally holding a "golden share" in U.S. Steel, granting him veto power, and the Department of Defense purchasing a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials. Proponents argue this strategy is necessary to counter China's economic influence and secure vital supply chains. However, critics warn that this level of government intervention distorts free markets and could set a precedent for further state control over private industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this personal opinion piece, an American comedian living in Scotland expresses her dismay over Donald Trump's visit to the country. She reflects on why she avoids discussing him in her comedy, noting the mental exhaustion his presence causes. The author contrasts Trump's desperate desire for Scottish acceptance with her own genuine love for the nation where she has built a life. She invokes the memory of the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley, whose famously defiant and profane protest sign during a previous Trump visit perfectly captured the feelings of many Scots. The article concludes that Trump will never be truly Scottish because he doesn't understand the country's spirit.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Columbia University's recent deal with the Trump administration represents a capitulation that marks a grim new era for American higher education. To restore federal research funding, the university agreed to pay a $200 million fine and allow a Trump-approved monitor to oversee admissions and academic departments. The author contends this is not regulation but an "extortion scheme" that sacrifices academic independence to appease political pressure. The article suggests this case will serve as a template for the administration to exert control over other institutions, undermining their integrity and ability to resist authoritarian demands.</p>

          <p>Leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, have used a major conference in Shanghai to call for international collaboration, particularly between the U.S. and China, to manage the risks of advanced artificial intelligence. Hinton warned that without cooperation, humanity risks losing control of AI, comparing the technology to a "cute tiger cub" that could mature into a dangerous threat. He emphasized that despite divergent national interests on many issues, preventing an AI takeover is a critical common ground. This call for collaboration comes amid escalating tech competition between the two global powers, highlighting a shared existential concern among some of the field's pioneers.</p>

          <p>While many couples are using credit cards to pay for increasingly expensive weddings, financial experts advise a strategic approach to avoid starting a marriage with high-interest debt. Using a card can be smart for earning rewards like points or miles, especially with large sign-up bonuses, but only if the balance is paid off immediately with existing savings. The article warns against carrying a balance, as average credit card APRs are at a high. It also suggests asking vendors about credit card fees or potential cash discounts, and considering dedicated wedding insurance for broader protection than credit cards can offer.</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is sparking debate about the future of the entire late-night television format. While some see it as a one-off financial move by Paramount, others view it as a signal of the genre's decline amid rising production costs and shrinking linear TV audiences. The article notes that while Colbert's show consistently won its time slot, its viewership has been declining and skews older. The fate of other shows, particularly ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract is up in 2026, will be a key indicator of whether this is an isolated event or the beginning of a larger industry trend.</p>

Roth acknowledges that universities have problems, such as ideological narrowness among faculty and a focus on exclusivity, but insists these are not the true drivers of the attack. He believes the goal is to force conformity and stifle the experimental and critical thinking that universities have long fostered in American democracy.</p>

          <p>A proposed federal law, the Captive Primate Safety Act, aims to combat the brutal illegal pet trade by banning the private ownership and breeding of primates across all 50 states. Animal welfare experts at the Oakland Zoo, which recently rescued a smuggled spider monkey, explain that the trade is fueled by social media and results in immense suffering. Poachers often kill entire family troops to capture infants, who then face chronic stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage in captivity. The bill, currently stalled in a House committee, is seen by a coalition of zoos and animal welfare groups as a key step in protecting these animals.</p>

          <p>This report details the aftermath of a brutal massacre in Yelwata, a farming village in Nigeria's Benue state, where at least 160 people were killed in an overnight attack. The violence is part of the country's escalating farmer-herder crisis, fueled by climate change, population growth, and a breakdown of traditional conflict resolution. Survivors and local leaders believe the attacks, largely blamed on armed herders, are a campaign to drive Christian farming communities from their fertile land. The incident has sparked international outrage and raised questions about government and security force complicity, as well as the safety of Christians in the region.</p>

Speaking at a major conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation and proposed a global AI organization, emphasizing China's willingness to share its technology, particularly with the Global South. This move is seen by analysts as an effort by China to build a multilateral coalition for AI development and regulation, contrasting with the U.S. approach of building a camp with its allies while restricting China's access to advanced technology.

This article explores the paradox where increased earnings don't translate to a feeling of financial security due to rising costs, existing debt, and lifestyle creep. Experts note that spending, not earning, creates the feeling of wealth, and those in an 'accumulation mode' of saving and investing often don't feel rich. The piece highlights that as income grows, so does the perceived amount of money needed to feel comfortable, creating a persistent 'hamster wheel' of financial anxiety for many high earners.</p>

There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential deal could include a 15% baseline tariff, similar to the recent U.S.-Japan agreement. While not ideal for the EU, such a deal would avert a more damaging trade war and provide stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
