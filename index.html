          <p>France and Indonesia have jointly called for the "mutual recognition" of Israel and Palestine, emphasizing the need for a political resolution to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Jakarta, he and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto condemned Israeli plans to control Gaza and any actions that forcibly displace the Palestinian population. Macron also mentioned plans to co-organize a conference on Gaza in New York with Saudi Arabia, aimed at reinvigorating efforts to recognize a Palestinian state and Israel's right to exist peacefully. Prabowo echoed support for a two-state solution, underscoring the unified stance of both nations on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The focus is on achieving a long-term political solution for the region.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department has rescinded its requirement for civilian employees to submit weekly bulleted lists of their accomplishments, which was initially mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Jay Hurst, performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, announced that the "five bullet exercise" is no longer necessary. Instead, employees are encouraged to submit ideas to improve efficiency and reduce waste within the department. This decision aligns with similar actions taken by other agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, which have also discontinued the weekly reports. The reports were part of an effort led by Elon Musk and DOGE to eliminate waste in the federal government.</p>

          <p>A new aid center in the Gaza Strip, supported by Israel, experienced chaotic scenes on its first full day of operation as desperate Palestinians surged toward the site amid looming starvation. Footage verified by The New York Times showed hundreds of people, including women and children, rushing for aid boxes, leading to trampling and the collapse of perimeter fencing. The Israeli military acknowledged firing warning shots in the area but denied aerial fire. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, responsible for the effort, noted the overwhelming needs and the team's retreat due to the large crowds, while the new system raises concerns about displacement and access to food.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German government is considering suspending family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for at least two years, a move that would disproportionately affect Syrian families. This status is granted to individuals who do not meet the criteria for refugee status but face serious harm in their home countries. While asylum-seekers and recognized refugees have the right to family reunification, those with subsidiary protection do not, leading to uncertainty and prolonged separation. Critics argue that this separation can cause psychological strain and encourage irregular immigration routes, while legal experts debate the compatibility of the suspension with German and EU law. The Constitutional Court may ultimately decide the legality of this measure, leaving families in limbo.</p>

          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, head of the Metropolitan Police, has cautioned that increased funding is essential to fulfill the government's promises to reduce crime. He lauded the government's ambitious goals, such as halving knife crime and violence against women and girls, but stressed that these objectives require financial backing. Rowley highlighted the lasting impact of previous austerity cuts on police forces and advocated for radical policing reform, including fewer policing organizations and a national police agency for better coordination. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to outline public service funding in the upcoming spending review, where the allocation for policing will be determined.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Metropolitan Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns regarding the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to ease prison overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued that the plans "could be of net detriment to public safety," citing potential issues with electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail. The government maintains that their concerns have been addressed, and that repeat offenders can still face short sentences and terrorists will not be eligible for early release. The Ministry of Justice insists that the reforms will ensure the most dangerous offenders are kept off the streets.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined £122.7 million, the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, for breaching regulations related to sewage spills and shareholder payouts. The regulator found that Thames Water failed to maintain adequate infrastructure, leading to routine sewage discharges and environmental damage. Additionally, the company was penalized for undeserved dividend payouts to shareholders that did not reflect its performance. The fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, and the funds will go to the Treasury; Ofwat said the penalties are a result of Thames Water's failure to protect the environment.</p>

A memo viewed by CBS News instructed embassies to remove unfilled appointments and prepare for expanded social media screening, although the specifics remain unclear. China has urged the US to protect international students' rights, while universities may be concerned about the financial impact, as they rely on foreign students for funding.

Existing home sales experienced their slowest April in 16 years, while builder confidence has dropped. High home prices, coupled with fluctuating mortgage rates and President Trump's tariff policies, have made housing unaffordable and unpredictable for many. Builders face rising costs and difficulty pricing homes, leading to slowed production, and potential buyers are hesitant due to economic concerns, resulting in a "holding pattern" in the housing market.</p>

          <h2>The Evolution of 'Pride' from Vice to LGBTQ Empowerment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "pride" has transformed from a term denoting excessive self-esteem to a symbol of LGBTQ empowerment. Originating before the 12th century, it initially carried negative connotations, linked to the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins. Over time, its meaning shifted towards self-respect, culminating in its adoption by the LGBTQ community in the late 1960s. The Stonewall Uprising and subsequent marches embraced "pride" to counter negative stereotypes and affirm self-worth, and while debates around its usage persist, the term remains a powerful symbol of resilience and progress for the LGBTQ community.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially up to £1,000 each, and could have debts written off following a scandal involving the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will disburse over £70 million in compensation and financial support after a review by Ofgem revealed suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Customers may receive payments ranging from £40 to £500, with higher amounts for inappropriate installations, while enforcement investigations continue for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo. A new code of practice is now in place to prevent future forced installations, and the government is reviewing Ofgem to reform the energy market.</p>

While some customers joked about the technology, others expressed concerns over increased surveillance, with some vowing to avoid self-checkouts. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024, prompting retailers to enhance security measures, and while some welcome the new tech, others worry about tracking customer behavior.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has suspended abortions in Missouri following a state Supreme Court order for new rulings in a legal battle over an abortion ban. The court determined that a district judge had applied incorrect standards when allowing abortions to resume, emphasizing the need to consider potential harms from allowing abortions. Attorney General Andrew Bailey praised the decision, stating that abortion providers must comply with state safety requirements. Planned Parenthood, which operates the state's only abortion clinics, immediately canceled appointments, and the organization hopes to return to court soon, and this comes as lawmakers have approved another ballot measure for an amendment that would reimpose a ban with exceptions for pregnancies caused by sexual assault or incest.</p>
