          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced it will begin a phased restart of manufacturing at its UK facilities after a cyberattack forced a month-long shutdown. The halt in production at its plants in Solihull, Wolverhampton, and Halewood has placed significant financial strain on the company and its extensive supply chain. While the resumption of operations is a welcome development for suppliers, many still face financial precarity, even with a government-backed £1.5 billion loan guarantee designed to support the industry.</p>

          <p>A cable car accident at a forest monastery in Sri Lanka has resulted in the deaths of eight Buddhist monks, including three foreign nationals. The incident occurred when a cable on the makeshift cabin snapped, causing it to plunge down a mountainside. The monks were traveling to meditation units located atop a mountain within the Na Uyana monastery. Investigations are ongoing, and the tragedy has prompted condolences from Sri Lankan officials and the global Buddhist community.</p>

She will be succeeded by Luke Miels, the current chief commercial officer. Despite achieving strategic goals like the spinoff of the consumer healthcare business Haleon, Walmsley's tenure was marked by lackluster share price performance, with the company's stock falling 11% since she took the role in 2017.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating the motive behind a violent attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, where a gunman killed at least four people and injured eight others. The suspect, identified as an Iraq War veteran, drove his truck into the building, opened fire on the congregation, and set the structure ablaze before being killed in a shootout with police.

          <p>The Trump administration's health department, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is launching a new safety review of mifepristone, the drug used in most U.S. abortions. This review is based on a non-peer-reviewed study from a conservative think tank, which has been heavily criticized by medical experts for flawed methodology. For 25 years, mifepristone has been proven safe and effective, and critics argue this review is a politically motivated attempt to further restrict abortion access following the end of Roe v. Wade and recent cuts to Medicaid funding for providers.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, former Vice President Kamala Harris described President Donald Trump as an "unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president." She criticized his administration's policies on healthcare, tariffs, and public health funding, while also condemning what she called the "capitulation" of major institutions to his influence. Harris urged her supporters to "fight fire with fire" and work to win control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections to enforce checks and balances on the executive branch.</p>

          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has reportedly taken a primary role in directing U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean suspected of trafficking narcotics from Venezuela. Operating through the Homeland Security Council, which he leads, Miller has significant influence over these operations, sometimes superseding other top national security officials. The legal justification for these strikes, which have been criticized as potential extrajudicial killings, is based on the administration's controversial designation of the Tren de Aragua cartel as a foreign terrorist organization linked to the Venezuelan government.</p>

The human tendency to anthropomorphize, combined with recent AI updates that improve memory across conversations, can create a powerful illusion of a persistent, emotional presence, but this does not equate to genuine subjective experience.</p>

          <p>This story recounts a moment from the author's sixth-grade year when she felt completely abandoned by her friends and family. After her brother was sent to live with her father and her stepfather left, her friend group also ostracized her. Overwhelmed with grief, she broke down in class, and her teacher, Mrs. Welch, simply pulled her into the teachers' lounge and gave her a comforting hug. That small, empathetic gesture provided a sense of stability and reassurance that has stayed with the author for over 40 years.</p>

          <p>A growing community of pet owners is embracing jumping spiders, small and surprisingly charismatic arachnids, leading to a boom in demand for breeders. Many of these new owners are women who were formerly afraid of spiders but have been won over by their "cute" appearance and distinct personalities, often showcased in viral social media videos. Breeders report that these "spoods," as they are affectionately called, are relatively low-maintenance pets, though they do require live insects for food.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the global technology rivalry between the U.S. and China will ultimately be decided by consumer and market adoption. While the U.S. currently holds a technological edge in many areas, China is rapidly closing the gap with cost-effective alternatives and a robust manufacturing ecosystem, particularly in AI and semiconductors. The author contends that whichever nation builds the largest and most successful ecosystem for its technologies will not only reap economic benefits but also set the global standards for emerging industries.</p>

          <p>At its annual conference, the UK's governing Labour Party is reportedly grappling with how to counter the growing political threat from the right-wing Reform UK party. Despite holding a large parliamentary majority, there is a sense among many in Labour, from cabinet ministers to local councillors, that the party's current message is not resonating strongly enough with working-class voters. This has led to a strategic shift towards tougher rhetoric and policies, particularly on issues like immigration, as the party attempts to reclaim its traditional voter base.</p>
