          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to choose a successor for Michael D. Higgins. Early tallies indicate strong support for independent candidate Catherine Connolly, who is backed by several left-wing parties, over her main rival, Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. The election has been marked by a potentially low turnout and a significant number of spoiled ballots. A third candidate's name remained on the ballot despite his withdrawal, adding a minor complication to the process.</p>

The storm has destroyed hundreds of homes and disrupted water supplies for over half a million people.

          <p>The Trump administration has abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a decision that could affect consumer prices for automobiles and home appliances. The halt was a direct response to a Canadian television ad that used a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan to criticize high tariffs. This move could prolong existing 50% levies on Canadian steel and aluminum, key components in many consumer goods, potentially leading to higher costs for US manufacturers and shoppers.

          <p>A viral social media claim that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 has been found to be false. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like renovations or low revenue, major markets in cities like Berlin, Dresden, and Cologne are proceeding as planned. The false rumor appears to have originated from a single article on a low-credibility website that cited unaffordable security costs and misrepresented information about specific towns. Despite rising security expenses, there is no evidence of widespread cancellations across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized the Ontario government for its decision to delay pausing a controversial television advertisement until after the first two World Series games. The ad, which uses a Ronald Reagan speech to argue against tariffs, prompted Trump to halt trade talks with Canada earlier in the week. Trump labeled the delay "dirty play" and threatened to respond in kind. The ad was broadcast to millions of American viewers during the first game of the series, which featured Ontario's own Toronto Blue Jays.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, will focus on resolving two major regional conflicts: the long-standing border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia, and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. US President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord aimed at de-escalating the Thai-Cambodian dispute. However, diplomatic efforts to address the crisis in Myanmar have been largely ineffective, with the bloc divided on how to engage with the country's military junta and its planned elections.</p>

          <p>The historic East Wing of the White House has been completely demolished as part of President Trump's plan to construct a new, privately funded $300 million ballroom. The move has drawn sharp criticism from presidential historians and former White House staff, who see it as a disregard for the building's heritage. The East Wing, first established in its modern form in 1942, housed the first lady's offices and served as the public entrance for tours and events. The administration has defended the demolition, calling the structure a "cheaply built add-on."</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several current and former Justice Department officials, including special counsel Jack Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland. Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI investigation, codenamed "Arctic Frost," which reportedly examined the phone records of nine Republican lawmakers following the 2020 election. This marks the latest instance of the president urging legal action against his political adversaries, a move that continues to fuel debates about the weaponization of the justice system.</p>

          <p>Russia is facing a severe demographic decline, characterized by a shrinking and aging population, a problem President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged for decades. In response, the government is implementing policies rooted in "traditional family values," including laws that restrict abortion access and ban "child-free ideology." However, these measures are failing to counteract the effects of economic uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, and an exodus of young men, which have caused birth rates to plummet to historic lows.</p>

          <p>Beijing has imposed sanctions on several subsidiaries of the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha, alleging the company supported a US investigation into Chinese competitors. The sanctions bar the Hanwha entities, including a US-based shipyard, from conducting business with Chinese individuals or companies. This move, while financially costly for the shipbuilder, could inadvertently bolster shipbuilding cooperation between Seoul and Washington. The sanctioned Philadelphia shipyard is a key part of a joint initiative to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry with South Korean investment.</p>

          <p>The private funding for President Trump's $300 million White House ballroom has come from dozens of major corporations, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. Donors include tech giants like Google and Amazon, defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, and cryptocurrency firms, many of whom have significant business before the federal government. These companies are seeking favorable policies, regulatory approval for deals, or lucrative government contracts, prompting critics to question whether the donations are intended to gain influence with the administration.</p>
