          <p>Thirty years after "Operation Storm," which ended the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia and Serbia maintain deeply divided narratives. Croatia celebrates the event as a heroic victory that secured its territory, holding a large military parade in Zagreb to commemorate the swift military action. Conversely, Serbia views the operation as a tragic pogrom that led to the mass exodus and murder of Serbian civilians, with President Aleksandar Vucic decrying it as a profound injustice. The differing perspectives highlight the lasting ethnic and political wounds from the Yugoslav wars, with both nations using the anniversary to bolster nationalist sentiment.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency manhunt is underway in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of killing four people at a local bar in the small town of Anaconda. The victims, all local residents known to the suspect, were shot in what authorities describe as a cold-blooded attack with no clear motive. The community is in mourning while remaining on high alert, as the suspect is considered armed, dangerous, and potentially unstable. Family members of the suspect have stated he has a history of mental illness, including PTSD from his time in the military.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is launching a 12-month pilot program that will require some business and leisure travelers to pay a bond of up to $15,000 to enter the country. The policy targets visitors from nations with high rates of visa overstays, aiming to test the feasibility of using financial bonds to ensure compliance with visa terms. Consular officers will have discretion over the bond amount, which will be based on the traveler's personal circumstances. The State Department views the program as both a practical measure and a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to address overstay issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International delegates are meeting in Geneva for a critical UN conference to finalize a legally binding global treaty aimed at tackling the plastic pollution crisis. The talks are stalled over fundamental disagreements, with nearly 100 countries advocating for ambitious production caps on single-use plastics and bans on harmful chemicals. However, a bloc of oil-producing nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, opposes production limits, favoring a focus on recycling instead. Scientists warn that plastic waste, which has been found everywhere from oceans to human tissue, poses a significant threat to wildlife and human health.</p>

          <p>Following a jobs report that showed a sharp economic slowdown, President Trump's dismissal of the figures as "phony" and the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner is part of a larger pattern. The article suggests the president has a history of discrediting or concealing data that presents an uncomfortable reality, from election results to pandemic statistics and climate change reports. Critics argue this strategy erodes trust in government institutions and could lead to poor policy decisions based on manipulated information. The White House maintains its focus is on ensuring data accuracy, pointing to the large size of the report's revisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Less than two years after a historic election ousted the populist Law and Justice party, Poland's liberal democratic government, led by Donald Tusk, is facing a significant decline in support. The authors argue that the initial euphoria has given way to frustration as the new government struggles to dismantle its predecessor's legal minefields and fails to offer a compelling future vision. By adopting some nationalist rhetoric on migration and failing to deliver on key promises like liberalizing abortion laws, Tusk's coalition is losing ground. This situation serves as a cautionary tale for other democracies about the persistent challenge of populism.</p>

          <p>Recent social media footage has revealed what appears to be China's new KJ-3000 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft. The prototype is based on a modified Y-20B transport plane and features a large, radar-hiding rotodome on its fuselage, suggesting advanced surveillance and command capabilities. While some Western militaries have moved away from this type of aircraft for modern warfare, Beijing's development of the KJ-3000 indicates a continued commitment to this strategy. The plane is a key component of China's efforts to modernize its air force and enhance its long-range detection and control systems.</p>

California's Governor Gavin Newsom stated his state would pursue its own partisan redistricting if Texas Republicans proceed with a plan to create five new GOP-leaning congressional seats. This response came as dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed for a vote.

This legal setback for the administration, prompted by a lawsuit from the ACLU, challenges one of the key pillars of its restrictive immigration policy.

          <p>Researchers and cave explorers in the Yorkshire Dales have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age. The find was made in a cave near Ingleborough as part of a project investigating the area's long history of human use and farming. The team also found evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The discoveries help illuminate the prehistoric relationship between humans, livestock, and the landscape, highlighting the importance of preserving ancient common lands.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged by more than 20% after President Trump posted on Truth Social praising the company's new ad campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney. The president's endorsement came amid online controversy where some critics accused the ad's wordplay on "genes" and "jeans" of having racial undertones. Trump lauded the campaign as the "HOTTEST" ad and contrasted it with what he termed "woke" advertising failures by other brands. The stock rally continues a meme-driven trend for the retailer, which had previously faced significant financial challenges and slow sales. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's critical energy supplies would be exhausted quickly in the event of a full military blockade by China. War-gaming scenarios showed that Taiwan's natural gas supplies would last only 11 days, coal reserves seven weeks, and oil reserves 20 weeks. However, the report also argues that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States.

          <p>More than 2.5 million Premium Bond prizes, totaling over £100 million, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom, according to a new report. The government-owned operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is facing criticism that its process for tracing winners is too difficult, especially for older accounts or bonds given as gifts. Among the unclaimed funds are eleven prizes worth £100,000 each. While NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of all winnings since 1957, critics argue more should be done to reunite people with their money during the ongoing cost of living crisis.

          <p>President Trump's recent praise for an American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has drawn attention to a wider social media controversy. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," was criticized by some online for echoing rhetoric associated with eugenics due to its focus on the blonde, blue-eyed actress. Others defended the ad as simple wordplay, and the debate intensified after reports that Sweeney is a registered Republican. Trump's intervention framed the issue as a victory against "woke" advertising, turning a marketing campaign into a flashpoint in the culture wars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed fat and muscle tissue. Lab tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by diphacinone, a common anticoagulant rodenticide, which the pigs likely consumed directly or by eating other poisoned animals. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use methods that prevent non-target wildlife from accessing bait. They also caution hunters to avoid consuming any animal with discolored tissue, as the meat could be contaminated with the poison.</p>

          <h2>Lowering Colon Cancer Screening Age to 45 Linked to Rise in Early-Stage Diagnoses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for people in the 45-49 age group. Following updated guidelines, screening rates in this demographic rose 62% between 2019 and 2023. This increase in testing is credited with catching the disease at a more treatable stage, a promising development in the fight against a cancer that has been rising in younger adults. However, researchers note that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable across different demographics.</p>

          <p>Three of the Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort have stated they are willing to stay away for the remainder of the legislative session and face any resulting consequences. By denying Republicans a quorum, they have temporarily halted a vote on new congressional maps that could add five GOP seats. The lawmakers defended their actions as a constitutional tool to fight against what they call an egregious and undemocratic gerrymander. They acknowledged Governor Greg Abbott's threats of arrest but said they are fighting for the principle of representative democracy.</p>

          <p>A group of more than a dozen progressive Democrats in the U.S. House, led by Congressman Ro Khanna, is urging the Trump administration to officially recognize a Palestinian state. In a letter to the president, the lawmakers argue that the current crisis has highlighted the urgent need for Palestinian self-determination. The letter adds that a viable Palestinian state would need to recognize Israel and guarantee its security, including the disarmament of Hamas. This move comes as several key U.S. allies have recently pledged to support Palestinian statehood, though the Trump administration has stated it opposes such a step.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, a member of the New South Wales state parliament in Australia, is legally fighting to keep his seat from his jail cell after being convicted of sexual offenses. Ward was found guilty last month of sexually assaulting two men and is now in custody awaiting sentencing, but he has refused to resign and plans to appeal his conviction. The NSW parliament had intended to vote to expel him, but his lawyers are seeking a court injunction to block the move. The situation has been called "unconscionable" by the state's Premier, who is urging Ward to step down.</p>
