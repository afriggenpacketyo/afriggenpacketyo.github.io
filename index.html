          <p>Russia bombarded Ukraine with one of its largest air assaults of the war, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries. The attack, which targeted cities and villages across the country, marks an escalation in violence amid stalled cease-fire negotiations, with Ukrainian officials accusing Russia of prolonging the conflict. Ukraine's Air Force reported shooting down about two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones, while President Zelenskyy called for increased international pressure on Putin. The strikes underscore the failure of diplomatic efforts to ease the conflict, as civilian deaths in Ukraine have been rising since February.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized foreign countries for allegedly not contributing to the education costs of their citizens attending Harvard and other U.S. institutions. This statement comes amidst an ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard over the university's international student enrollment policies, which saw a judge temporarily block the administration from canceling Harvard's student visa program after the university filed a lawsuit. Harvard claims the policy is retaliatory for its First Amendment rights, while the Department of Homeland Security alleges the university failed to provide requested student behavioral records. The administration has already frozen billions in federal funding to Harvard over alleged antisemitism and DEI practices.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid has appointed Xabi Alonso, their former midfielder, as their new manager on a three-year deal, succeeding Carlo Ancelotti who will now coach Brazil.

His success at Leverkusen marks his first full season as a senior club manager, establishing him as one of the most promising managers in football. The appointment signifies a strategic move by Real Madrid to bring in a manager with a deep understanding of the club's culture and a proven track record of success.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has declined to confirm whether the government plans to abolish the two-child benefit cap, a policy preventing most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Rayner pointed to the establishment of a Child Poverty Taskforce, currently assessing various measures, including the cap's removal. She also denied being the source of a leaked memo suggesting the government "claw back" child benefit payments from wealthier families, and refuted claims of cabinet splits. The issue arises after the Prime Minister reversed cuts to winter fuel payments, indicating a cautious approach to affordability.</p>

          <p>In the retrial of Karen Read, accused of killing her police officer boyfriend, forensic evidence is a key focus for both prosecution and defense. The prosecution presents data from Read’s car and the victim’s phone to suggest Read struck O’Keefe with her car, while the defense raises questions about the credibility of the prosecution's experts and suggests alternative causes for O’Keefe's injuries. The defense argues that O'Keefe's injuries could have resulted from a confrontation inside a house. The trial has also revisited the controversy surrounding the lead investigator, who was fired over inappropriate text messages.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is grappling with concerns about its aging leadership, highlighted by President Biden's cognitive issues and the recent deaths of several older House Democrats. This has sparked debate about the party's ability to connect with younger voters and balance experience with fresh perspectives, with tensions arising between younger members and the old guard. The article suggests the party needs to address the issue of aging leaders to revivify its ideas and approaches and elevate new voices. The debate comes as a 25-year-old recently elected as a vice chairman of the national party plans to spend millions to get more young blood into the party, and to support primary challengers against the party’s older incumbents, with an eye toward dismantling a “culture of seniority politics.”</p>

          <p>This article addresses questions about inherited Roth IRAs, the SECURE Act's impact on distributions, and retirement planning strategies for those starting late. It clarifies that spouses inheriting IRAs from original owners can treat them as their own, but this doesn't apply to "doubly inherited" IRAs, which are subject to different rules. The article also advises individuals in their late 50s to maximize Social Security benefits, delay retirement, and seek fee-only financial planning to compensate for lost time in retirement savings (not investment advice). Reverse mortgages are discussed in the context of assisted living, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of repayment terms.</p>

Despite calls for reform, the department's culture of aggression remains a concern, with critics noting that internal affairs investigations rarely find fault with officers' use of force. While the LAPD has seen some changes, including fewer low-level arrests and traffic stops due to staffing shortages, some efforts at reform have stalled.

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address to West Point graduates, donning a "Make America Great Again" cap and outlining a foreign policy focused on peacemaking and partnership. Trump criticized past political leaders for misusing the military for unintended missions and touted his "Golden Age" agenda. He emphasized the importance of service and sacrifice, contrasting it with careers in business, and highlighting qualities of "honor" and "sacrifice". The speech framed his foreign policy as prioritizing core national interests and seeking peaceful resolutions, even with countries with profound differences.</p>

          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors amid increased government repression and a boycott call from the main opposition. The vote is the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which incumbent President Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won despite evidence of fraud. The opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado, urges voters to boycott, calling the elections a "parody" designed to legitimize Maduro's rule. In the days leading up to the vote, the government detained dozens of people, including a high-profile opposition leader, linking them to an alleged plot to disrupt the election.</p>

          <p>Venezuela is holding elections for the National Assembly and state governors, a year after a presidential election marred by falsified results and a subsequent crackdown on protesters. The vote is intended to project a veneer of democracy, but independent monitors are absent, and many believe the results will be manufactured. The election has reopened a rift among opposition activists, with some calling for abstention as a protest against the Maduro government, while others argue that participation is necessary to signal discontent. The article highlights the government's tactics to divide the opposition and the challenges faced by those seeking to challenge Maduro's rule.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his family have monetized the White House more than any other occupant, normalizing activities that once would have provoked heavy blowback and official investigations. The Trump family and its business partners have collected hundreds of millions in fees from various ventures, including cryptocurrency, real estate deals, and exclusive clubs. Despite ethical concerns, the Trump administration has dismantled instruments of accountability, leading to a lack of official investigations. While Democrats and critics attempt to highlight these activities, they struggle to gain traction without the usual mechanisms of official review, and the public seems to have grown desensitized to the ethical breaches.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement faces a significant backlash, with many initiatives being reversed and a shift towards what the article calls "white grievance" politics. Despite initial widespread support, public opinion has waned, and efforts to address racial inequality have faced resistance. The Trump administration has dismantled diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and targeted perceived racial preferences, while the Justice Department has abandoned police oversight agreements. Though progress has been made in some areas of police reform, there is concern that the current retrenchment may undo these gains.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party faces alarmingly low approval ratings and struggles to regain its footing after a defeat that felt like a cultural rejection.

The article explores the ideological debates and strategies being considered by Democratic leaders and activists to rebuild the party and reconnect with voters. The Democrats are also seeking to win back working-class voters, commissioning new projects that can read like anthropological studies of people from faraway places.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the decline of deep male friendships in his life, noting a broader trend of American men becoming worse at maintaining close connections. He explores the reasons behind this, including societal expectations, fear of appearing soft or needy, and the prioritization of romantic relationships and family. The article contrasts this with historical examples of open affection between men and examines how societal norms around masculinity have changed.
