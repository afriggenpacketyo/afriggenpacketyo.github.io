          <p>A 20-year-old inmate successfully escaped a prison near Lyon, France, by concealing himself inside his cellmate's luggage as the latter was being released. The prison administration has acknowledged that the escape was the result of "a series of serious malfunctions" and has launched an internal investigation. This incident highlights significant security lapses at the Lyon-Corbas prison, which is also reportedly suffering from severe overcrowding, holding nearly double its intended capacity of inmates. The escaped prisoner was serving multiple sentences and was also under investigation for connections to organized crime.</p>

          <p>This article details how Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney with a Ph.D. in biology, pioneered the use of investigative genetic genealogy to solve major crimes. Initially a hobby, her work led to the 2018 identification and capture of the notorious Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo. The technique involves building family trees from DNA evidence uploaded to public genealogy websites, a method she also used to identify a living Jane Doe who had been kidnapped as a child. Despite privacy concerns, this forensic tool is now widely used by law enforcement, leading to breakthroughs in numerous cold cases.</p>

          <p>Amid the devastating floods in Texas, a growing conspiracy theory, amplified by some politicians, incorrectly attributes the disaster to cloud seeding. Experts assert that this misinformation is baseless, as cloud seeding is a weather modification technique aimed at increasing precipitation but is incapable of creating such catastrophic weather events. The spread of these false claims is damaging public trust in scientific institutions and distracting from the real-world factors contributing to the floods. This highlights a troubling trend of scientific denial during natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric cars cheaper to purchase, with details expected later this week. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct subsidies, the plan aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier for many motorists. The government also announced a £88 million package to expand charging infrastructure, including installing "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. This initiative is part of the UK's strategy to meet its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death toll from the catastrophic flash floods in Texas has risen to 129, with search operations for missing individuals being suspended in some areas due to ongoing danger from more heavy rain. A flash flood emergency has been declared for parts of central Texas, with life-threatening conditions persisting in Kerr and Gillespie Counties. Rivers like the Lampasas have seen dramatic and rapid rises, exacerbating the crisis in already devastated communities like Kerrville and Burnet. The National Weather Service warns of continued high-impact flooding as the weather system persists over the region.</p>

          <p>Women's basketball hall-of-famer Nancy Lieberman has publicly called on WNBA players to "embrace" the attention Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark is bringing to the league. She argued that any jealousy or pettiness towards Clark, who she called the best guard in the league, is counterproductive to the sport's growth. Lieberman compared Clark's impact to that of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, suggesting that her popularity benefits all players by increasing revenue and visibility for the entire WNBA.

          <p>The Trump administration has floated the idea that "able-bodied" adults enrolled in Medicaid could fill labor shortages on farms resulting from a crackdown on immigrant workers. Robin Rudowitz, a health policy expert at KFF, discusses the significant challenges and unlikeliness of such a plan succeeding. The proposal overlooks the specific skills, demanding physical nature, and geographic location of farm labor, which do not align with the circumstances of most Medicaid recipients. Critics argue the plan is impractical and fails to understand the realities of both the agricultural workforce and the population served by Medicaid.</p>

A retired Air Force general, Bacon cited the exhaustion from 12- to 14-hour workdays and the increasing intensity of harassment and death threats from both the far-left and "dark MAGA" supporters. Representing a swing district that voted for Kamala Harris, Bacon often found himself a target for his willingness to criticize Donald Trump and vote across party lines.

          <p>A new Senate committee report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.

The report, led by Senator Rand Paul, describes a "disturbing pattern of communication failures and negligence," and accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of falsely testifying to Congress.

Zheng believes that by focusing on empirical research derived from China's own practical experiences, think tanks can better explain the nation's policies and predict its future trajectory.

These include establishing a brief morning routine together, sending thoughtful check-in messages during the day, and taking individual time to de-stress after work before reconnecting. Additionally, they prioritize a daily, distraction-free period of "us time" and end each day with a quick, quiet check-in to maintain emotional alignment.

          <p>The United Kingdom continues to experience a heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 31C on Sunday, though this marks a slight dip from the peak. Amber heat health alerts remain active for much of England, warning of potential health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The hot weather, which saw Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland record their warmest days of the year, has prompted hosepipe bans in several regions. The Met Office forecasts that the heatwave will break on Monday, bringing cooler temperatures and welcome rain to many parts of the country.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River have accidentally discovered a previously unknown shipwreck believed to be the L.W. Crane, a vessel that sank in 1880. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was mapping the river bottom for other known cultural sites when they found the partially buried 90-foot hull. The L.W. Crane was a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in Oshkosh over 140 years ago. This unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, even in well-traveled waterways.</p>

          <p>An article querying ChatGPT about car reliability found that the AI identified Toyota as the most dependable brand, a conclusion that aligns with established industry sources like Consumer Reports and J.D. Power. The AI highlighted Toyota's reputation for longevity, low average annual repair costs ($441 compared to a $652 industry average), and strong resale value as key factors. Honda, Subaru, and Mazda were also noted as reliable alternatives. In contrast, luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz were cited as generally less reliable due to their complex engineering and higher maintenance expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a biotransformation system that can turn methanol, an alcohol derivable from carbon dioxide, into sucrose, or white sugar. This breakthrough, achieved at the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, offers a potential pathway to convert captured carbon into food without relying on traditional agriculture. The enzyme-based process bypasses the need for land and water-intensive crops like sugar cane. The researchers state this "artificial conversion" strategy could help address both environmental challenges and global food security, contributing to carbon neutrality goals.</p>

          <p>Following years of patients sharing experiences of painful IUD insertions, the medical community is now taking the issue more seriously. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recently issued recommendations urging doctors to discuss and provide pain management options, a shift from past practices where pain was often minimized. Options now being considered more widely include topical anesthetics and nerve-blocking injections. This change reflects a broader movement to address the historical dismissal of women's pain in medicine and improve the patient experience for this popular contraceptive method.</p>

          <p>The president of Germany's parliament, Julia Klöckner of the conservative CDU party, has ordered the removal of all rainbow flags from parliamentary offices, citing rules against displaying signs on windows and facades. The move has sparked a fiery debate, with opposition Green and Left party members accusing her of having a "bigoted understanding" of neutrality. Klöckner, who previously opposed flying the flag above the Bundestag for Pride, argues the decision is based on house rules and the need for neutrality. Critics contend the ban sends a harmful message at a time when LGBTQ+ rights are under increased pressure.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" and prepare for a potential trade war with the United States. His statement follows President Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on nearly all EU imports, a sharp escalation from a previously discussed 10% agreement. While some EU leaders have urged calm, Macron is pushing the bloc to mobilize all available instruments, including anti-coercion tools, if a deal is not reached. The threat has sent shockwaves through European industries, particularly Germany's automotive sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark 2023 civil rights settlement that mandated Alabama to fix a decades-old raw sewage crisis in Lowndes county has been terminated by the Trump administration. The deal was dismissed as an "illegal" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) program, halting a federally funded effort to provide functioning sanitation to the majority-Black, high-poverty community. For generations, residents have been exposed to parasite-infested wastewater due to failing or nonexistent septic systems. The decision removes the federal mandate and funding, leaving the resolution of this severe public health and environmental justice crisis in doubt.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions Why Texas, the Most Disaster-Prone State, Resists Proactive Preparations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 07:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of deadly floods, this article analyzes the political culture in Texas that consistently prioritizes disaster recovery over preventative measures. Despite being the most disaster-prone U.S. state—facing hurricanes, floods, and extreme heat—its leadership often resists government spending on preparedness, as seen with the recently killed flood-warning bill. This reluctance is attributed to a powerful fossil fuel industry, a political ideology favoring small government, and widespread skepticism of climate change among state leaders. The result is a repeating cycle of catastrophe followed by insufficient action to prevent the next one.</p>
