          <p>Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura faced cross-examination in the trial against Sean "Diddy" Combs, accused of sexual assault, sex trafficking, and racketeering. Combs' defense sought to undermine Ventura's claims of sexual coercion, drugging, and physical abuse by presenting text messages suggesting a loving relationship and Ventura's willing participation in "freak-offs," which she described as drug-fueled orgies. Ventura maintained she engaged in these acts out of fear and to appease Combs, who would become violent if she refused. The defense also highlighted texts indicating Ventura's jealousy and desire for a more committed relationship with Combs, arguing infidelity was mutual. The article suggests that the trial hinges on whether Ventura's actions were coerced or consensual, with the defense attempting to portray her as a willing participant in Combs' lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A strike by New Jersey Transit rail engineers has commenced, halting commuter train services and impacting approximately 70,000 commuters who rely on the agency's trains to reach Manhattan on a typical weekday. The strike, the first transit worker strike in the state since 1983, follows failed negotiations between the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) union and NJ Transit over pay and contract terms. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including cross-honoring rail tickets on buses and light rail, and adding Park-and-Ride locations, but these measures are expected to accommodate only a fraction of the displaced rail commuters. The economic impact of the strike is estimated to reduce overall productivity in New York City by millions per hour, and transportation experts predict increased congestion across transit systems.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, a medical examiner testified about the skull fractures and hypothermia found in the autopsy of John O'Keefe, stating the cause of death was head trauma and hypothermia, but the manner of death was undetermined. The examiner found multiple skull fractures from a cut on the right side of O'Keefe's head. During cross-examination, defense attorney Robert Alessi questioned whether the injuries were consistent with a fall on frozen ground. The toxicology report showed O'Keefe had a high blood alcohol level and no drugs in his system. The article highlights the conflicting interpretations of the medical evidence in the trial.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or risk becoming a ‚Äúshock absorber‚Äù in the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. Despite recent reductions in tariffs following talks in Geneva, economists caution that Europe's outlook remains bleak if it fails to adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder global trade. Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, suggests that without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe's ambition to become a 'third pole' will remain a slogan, forcing it to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes. The article emphasizes the need for Europe to proactively address its economic and political strategies to avoid being marginalized in the evolving global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>Australia's most-decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost an appeal against a defamation judgement that found he committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The original 2023 ruling stated that news articles alleging Roberts-Smith murdered four unarmed Afghans were true. Roberts-Smith argued the judge made legal errors, but a panel of Federal Court judges unanimously upheld the original judgement. The case, dubbed "the trial of the century," is the first time a court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces.

          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is not fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, which begins on June 1. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson acknowledged the agency is only "80 or 85% there" in terms of planning, citing staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and a lack of coordination with states. The Trump administration's intent for FEMA is to prioritize state-level responses and limit federal involvement, which has led to uncertainty and sinking morale within the agency. The article highlights the concerns surrounding FEMA's readiness for the hurricane season and the impact of the administration's policies on the agency's operations.</p>

          <p>Former FBI director James Comey is under investigation after he shared and then deleted a social media post, which Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against President Donald Trump. Comey posted on Instagram a photo of seashells that spelled the numbers "8647", which he captioned: "Cool shell formation on my beach walk." The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include 'to reject' or 'to get rid of', according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which also notes that it has more recently been used as a term meaning 'to kill'. Trump is the 47th US president. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged the message was a call for the assassination of Trump, but Comey said he opposed violence.</p>
