            <p>Nobel Prize-winning Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa has died at the age of 89 in Lima, Peru, surrounded by his family. Llosa, a giant of Latin American literature, explored themes of male violence, societal disruption, and authoritarian politics through his powerful storytelling. His works often shed light on the challenges faced by his native continent during periods of political repression. Llosa also entered the political arena in 1990 as a right-wing candidate for president of Peru, though he lost. He attracted criticism in recent years for comments about feminism and the deaths of Mexican journalists, but his books remained popular worldwide.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has extended an invitation to Donald Trump to visit Ukraine before any potential agreement with Russia to end the ongoing war. Zelensky emphasized the importance of seeing the human cost of the conflict firsthand, including civilians, soldiers, and destroyed infrastructure. The invitation comes after a devastating Russian missile attack on Sumy, Ukraine, which resulted in numerous casualties. International leaders have condemned the attack, with some calling it a war crime and urging stronger measures to enforce a ceasefire.</p>

            <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and looming US tariffs, China's chip exports continue to rise. In 2024, China exported 298.1 billion integrated circuit units, marking an 11.6% year-on-year increase. This comes as the US government, citing national security concerns, plans to impose new tariffs on Chinese tech products, including semiconductors. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that these electronic goods would be included in the upcoming tariffs, which are expected to be implemented in a month or two. China has been ramping up efforts to boost its domestic chip industry amid heightened US-China tech tensions.</p>

            <p>A retrial has commenced for Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times, stemming from a 2017 editorial that falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting. Palin claims the editorial damaged her reputation and career. The Times has acknowledged the inaccuracy but maintains it was an honest mistake that was quickly corrected. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the case after a previous ruling rejected Palin's claims, citing flaws in the initial trial. The retrial unfolds amidst a climate of heightened scrutiny and criticism of media outlets by political figures.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investors should reconsider their approach to oil and gas companies, similar to how defense policies have been reevaluated after the Russia-Ukraine war. Goldman Sachs argues that the energy transition will be longer than expected, and oil and gas companies are significant investors in low-carbon energy. However, not everyone agrees, with some arguing that the negative impacts of fossil fuels outweigh the potential benefits of including these companies in ESG portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

The Chinese leadership has set an ambitious annual growth target of "around 5%," but escalating trade tensions and weak domestic consumption pose challenges.

            <p>Andrew Buen, a former Colorado sheriff's deputy convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 death of Christian Glass, is set to be sentenced. Glass, a 22-year-old man in distress, had called 911 for help. Buen was convicted after a second trial, with the first jury unable to reach a verdict on murder and official misconduct charges. The case drew national attention and led to changes in how officers are trained to respond to people in mental health crises. Glass's parents were awarded a $19 million settlement.</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has responded to a motion for relief by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador, stating that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch in foreign relations. Abrego Garcia's attorneys requested the court to order the DOJ to demand the El Salvadoran government return him, which the DOJ argues would involve violating the sovereignty of a foreign nation.

            <p>China's exports experienced a surge in March, driven by businesses accelerating shipments in anticipation of tariff increases from the United States. However, analysts caution that this may be a "final hurrah" before exports decline in the coming months. The increase of 12.4 per cent in exports was accompanied by a decrease of 4.3 per cent in imports. The global trade landscape is expected to become more challenging due to drastic tariff increases from the US.</p>
