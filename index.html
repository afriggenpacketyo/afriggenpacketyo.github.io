          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, driven by strong performance in its search, advertising, and cloud divisions. Despite the positive results, the company announced it will increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, signaling a major ramp-up in AI-related investments. Google's AI Overviews now reach over 2 billion monthly users, and its Gemini app has 450 million active users, highlighting the company's significant expansion in artificial intelligence. The company's overall revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, although operating expenses also saw a substantial increase.</p>

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with significant growth in its software and hybrid cloud segments. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading, a reaction attributed to a cautious outlook from CEO Arvind Krishna, who cited geopolitical tensions and constrained U.S. federal spending. Despite these headwinds, IBM reaffirmed its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow. The results showed a nearly 8% year-over-year increase in revenue, a notable acceleration from the previous quarter.</p>

          <p>Chace Calicut, a top-rated high school football player committed to the University of Georgia, was arrested in Texas on a felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The arrest stems from an alleged road rage incident where Calicut and another individual are accused of chasing and firing a gun at a vehicle occupied by two other 17-year-olds. According to court documents, the victims were familiar with Calicut and claimed he had been making threats for several months. A judge has set his bond at $75,000, and he remains in custody.</p>

          <p>According to the Global Footprint Network, July 24 marks Earth Overshoot Day for this year, the date when humanity has used all the biological resources that the planet can regenerate in a full year. This year's date is over a week earlier than last year's, partly due to revised data on oceans' CO2 absorption capacity. The report highlights a trend of overconsumption that began in the 1970s, leading to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and increased carbon emissions. While high-income nations like Qatar and the US have the largest footprints, some countries like Uruguay are making strides with renewable energy to reduce their impact.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant legal decisions, federal judges in Tennessee and Maryland have intervened in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges. A Tennessee judge ruled he should be released from criminal custody while awaiting trial, while a Maryland judge barred immigration authorities from immediately detaining or deporting him upon release. The Maryland order requires the government to provide 72 hours' notice before any removal proceedings and mandates his return to supervised release in Maryland. These rulings are a rebuke to the Trump administration, which had unlawfully deported Abrego Garcia once before.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock dropped significantly after the company lowered its same-store sales forecast for the year, now expecting flat growth instead of a previously projected low-single-digit increase. The revision came after traffic declined for the second consecutive quarter, with the company reporting a 4% drop in same-store sales, which was steeper than analysts had anticipated. Executives attributed the slowdown to consumer concerns about the economy, which led to reduced restaurant visits.

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City fundamentally changed how the nation responds to missing children, leading to a new era of parental anxiety and law enforcement protocols. An appeals court recently ordered a new trial for Pedro Hernandez, who was convicted in 2017 of Patz's murder, bringing the landmark case back into the public eye. Patz's case spurred the creation of national missing child registries, the end of mandatory waiting periods for police reports, and the famous milk carton campaigns of the 1980s. The event marked a cultural shift away from unsupervised childhood freedom toward the modern concept of "stranger danger."</p>

While net income also fell, Tesla indicated it has started initial builds of a more affordable model, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025.

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers weighing their options between a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account must consider the trade-off between guaranteed returns and liquidity. A CD offers a fixed interest rate but requires locking funds away, while a high-yield savings account provides access to money but has a variable rate that could decrease. Based on current rates, a $10,000 deposit in a 6-month CD could earn slightly more guaranteed interest than a high-yield savings account over the same period. This makes the CD a potentially better choice for those who can afford to set their money aside. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new movie "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" is reviewed as a refreshing departure from modern superhero epics, embracing a staid, retro sci-fi tone reminiscent of the 1950s. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film presents its heroes as settled-down adults, skipping the typical origin story to focus on a more deliberate, character-driven narrative. The plot centers on the team facing the world-devouring Galactus, but the conflict is framed as a lean showdown of self-control versus gluttony rather than a frantic action caper. The review praises the film's emotionally credible performances, sleek visuals, and respect for its "lame" but dignified source material.</p>

          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, President Donald Trump was personally informed by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May that his name was mentioned multiple times in Department of Justice documents concerning Jeffrey Epstein. This meeting occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not be releasing the files to the public, a decision that angered many of Trump's supporters. The report states Trump was also told that many other high-profile individuals were named and that officials considered much of the information to be unverified hearsay. The White House has dismissed the story as a continuation of "fake news."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new AI Action Plan has drawn sharp criticism from climate advocates, who describe it as a thinly veiled effort to accelerate fossil fuel development under the guise of technological advancement. The plan pledges to streamline permitting for data centers and semiconductor plants by dismantling environmental regulations, including provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act. Critics argue that this "Build, Baby, Build!" approach will intensify the AI sector's already massive energy and water consumption, exacerbating the climate crisis at the expense of environmental justice and public well-being.</p>

While traditionally valued for portfolio protection, gold's rapid appreciation has also made it a profitable asset for savvy investors. Experts note that even with the high price, there are accessible entry points like fractional bars and dollar-cost averaging for those looking to invest. (not investment advice)</p>

His decision leaves the field of potential GOP challengers to incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul more open, with Rep. Elise Stefanik now seen as a likely frontrunner.

Protesters condemned Wells Fargo, a major financier of fossil fuels, for abandoning its climate commitments and for its investments in companies linked to the Dakota Access pipeline.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has temporarily halted debt forgiveness for student loan borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. This pause is a direct result of court orders blocking the Biden administration's more generous SAVE plan, which had altered how qualifying payments and forbearances were counted toward forgiveness. Because the rules for payment counts are now in flux, the department has put IBR discharges on hold until it can establish the correct calculations. The delay is not expected to affect borrowers who are still years away from forgiveness, but it creates uncertainty for those nearing the end of their repayment term.</p>

The piece recounts discovering both Black Sabbath and Ozzy's solo work on a single cassette tape, initially not realizing the same unique, inimitable voice fronted both. The author acknowledges Ozzy's vocal imperfections and personal failings but argues his vulnerability, charisma, and history of survival made him a relatable and beloved figure. Ultimately, the tribute celebrates the profound and real connection fans felt with the "Prince of Darkness," whose impact transcended his often-chaotic life.</p>

          <p>A revolution in sports nutrition is enabling cyclists in the Tour de France to perform at unprecedented levels by consuming massive amounts of carbohydrates during races. According to exercise metabolism researcher Tim Podlogar, elite riders are now ingesting up to 120 grams of carbs per hour, a significant increase from previous norms. This is made possible by new energy gels and drinks formulated with specific glucose and fructose ratios that allow the body to absorb more fuel without gastrointestinal distress. This advanced fueling strategy helps athletes maintain high-intensity output over the grueling, multi-week event, fundamentally changing the physical limits of the sport.</p>

Backed by tech leaders like David Sacks, the initiative is framed as a "pro-growth" approach necessary for the U.S. to win the global AI race against competitors like China.
