        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese imports, experts believe that e-commerce giants Temu and Shein are well-positioned to remain competitive in the U.S. market. These companies have been proactively adopting localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices may increase, Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and ability to offer lower prices than competitors like Amazon are expected to sustain their appeal to U.S. consumers. The article explains that Temu is offering local warehouse goods, and Shein is expanding its supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's new chancellor at a time of significant challenges for the nation, including a stagnant economy, strained relations with the United States, and the rise of a nationalist party. Despite lacking executive experience in government, Merz has taken an aggressive approach to address these issues, criticizing President Trump, engaging with foreign counterparts, and breaking campaign promises on fiscal restraint to invest in national defense. However, his about-faces on spending and migration have alienated some conservative voters, and he faces low approval ratings as he begins his term.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has proposed a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States, citing concerns about the declining American film industry and incentives offered by other countries.
