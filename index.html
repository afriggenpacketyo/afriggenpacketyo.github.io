          <p>Executives from major corporations like Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi have expressed concerns about the unsteady business environment caused by President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. The frequent alterations to these policies have led many U.S. companies to delay hiring and investment plans, fearing potential financial repercussions. Experts warn that this paralysis could impede economic momentum and potentially trigger a downturn. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defends the administration's approach as "strategic uncertainty," aimed at leveraging trade negotiations, but companies are warning of potential losses due to the lack of clarity.

          <p>A federal judge dismissed criminal charges against Sung Kim, a former Atlanta police officer, in the 2019 death of Jimmy Atchison, citing "textbook self-defense." Kim, a member of the FBI Atlanta Violent Crime Task Force, shot Atchison during an arrest operation when Atchison made a sudden movement. Judge Michael Brown ruled that the prosecution was an abuse of prosecutorial discretion, based on Supremacy Clause immunity and self-defense immunity. Kim's attorney stated that while a young man died, the decision to prosecute Kim was an inexcusable abuse of discretion, and the judge's decision was unambiguous.</p>

Trump has responded with criticism and accusations of judicial activism, however, judges have blocked his Liberation Day tariffs and attempts to expel immigrants without due process. His administration has also faced legal challenges for undermining law firms and evading judicial orders. Experts argue that Trump's attacks on the judiciary undermine the separation of powers and endanger judges' safety, and there is a simple way to get judges to stop overruling his actions: stop taking all these illegal, vindictive actions and stop issuing all these destructive, lawless executive orders.</p>

His essay implies potential U.S. punishment if European states do not change their policies on free speech, election administration, and migration.
