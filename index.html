          <p>A powerful earthquake in Myanmar has caused widespread devastation, with the death toll climbing steadily.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies describes the situation as a major humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by pre-existing vulnerabilities in the country.  The IFRC's appeal for global solidarity highlights the significant damage to infrastructure and communication disruptions hindering rescue efforts; potential bias: ABC News, while striving for neutrality, may inadvertently lean towards emphasizing the humanitarian aspect due to its focus on relief efforts.</p>
