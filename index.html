        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims panel unanimously rejected the Trump administration's request to delay rulings on disability benefits for military veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs had sought to halt nearly all cases, citing the ongoing government shutdown, but the court deemed this an "extreme request" without sufficient justification. Veterans advocacy groups strongly criticized the move, arguing it exploited the shutdown to deny timely benefits to individuals who have often waited decades for compensation related to service-connected issues like toxic exposures. This article highlights a significant instance of judicial pushback against the administration and its implications for veterans' access to justice and essential care, ensuring their claims are not indefinitely postponed.</p>

          <p>Families in Payne County, Oklahoma, are expressing outrage after Jesse Butler, a high school student accused of multiple violent sexual assaults, was reclassified as a "youthful offender," enabling him to avoid prison. Butler, now 18, pleaded no contest to 11 felony charges, including attempted first-degree sexual assault and strangulation, with the offenses occurring before he turned 18. Consequently, a 78-year sentence was suspended under a state-supervised rehabilitation plan until his 19th birthday, requiring counseling, community service, and a curfew. Victims describe lasting trauma, and a state representative has accused local officials of favoritism, calling for a grand jury investigation into the prosecution's handling of this article's significant case.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, indicating a recovery in demand for its x86 processors for PCs, causing its stock to jump 6% in extended trading. The chipmaker received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government as part of an $8.9 billion investment negotiated by the Trump administration, making the government a top shareholder. Intel also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, planning to integrate Intel's CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to boost its data center business. Despite accounting complexities due to the government shutdown, Intel remains committed to advancing U.S. semiconductor production and expects chip demand to continue outpacing supply next year.</p>

FBI Director Kash Patel announced two cases: one involving insider sports betting and another concerning rigged poker games using high-tech cheating methods. Billups faces charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy related to the poker scheme, while Rozier is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in the sports betting case. The NBA has placed both on immediate leave, emphasizing the league's commitment to game integrity amid these serious allegations.</p>

          <p>Beijing's tightening of rare earth export controls is viewed as a direct and reasonable response to the Trump administration's escalating restrictions on Chinese companies and exports, according to an opinion article. The US had blacklisted numerous Chinese institutions, imposed tariffs on various goods, and extended export controls to thousands of subsidiaries. These actions, including sanctions on Chinese refineries buying Iranian oil and efforts to ban Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace, have created a hostile trade environment. This article suggests the US should not be surprised by China's use of export restrictions, as the White House provided the blueprint and rationale for such measures.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring formal approval for nearly all Department of Defense correspondence and interactions with Congress, according to a document obtained by CBS News. The new policy mandates that most offices, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and military department secretaries, route communications through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs. Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Jack Reed and Representative Adam Smith, expressed deep concern, arguing the memo raises serious questions about transparency and impedes Congress's ability to conduct oversight.
