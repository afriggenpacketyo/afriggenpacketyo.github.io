          <p>Defense Secretary John Healey anticipates the UK's defense spending to reach 3% of GDP by 2034, a key assumption underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defense review. The review, a 130-page document, will outline military and security spending priorities, warning of emerging threats like drones and AI, and will address the dangers posed by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that meeting the 3% target would require an additional Â£17.3 billion in 2029-30. Other government departments are still negotiating their budgets, with disagreements remaining between the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasury. </p>

          <p>Three women and two physicians are suing to block a Kansas law that nullifies advance medical directives for pregnant women regarding end-of-life treatment. The lawsuit challenges a clause in the state's Natural Death Act, arguing it violates rights to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment, and freedom of speech. The plaintiffs argue the law forces physicians to provide a lower standard of care to pregnant patients and exposes them to legal penalties. The defendants include Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach and other state officials.</p>

Scammers are selling mock papers online at inflated prices, falsely claiming they use AI to predict actual questions.

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a Â£2 billion upgrade, designed to improve prosperity and reduce journey times in the region. Originally conceived in 1990, the project involved significant construction, including over 40 new bridges, and extensive environmental mitigation efforts, such as planting 285,000 trees. The final stage was financed using the Mutual Investment Model, requiring the Welsh government to pay over Â£40 million annually for 30 years. While some criticize the cost and delays, others view the upgraded road as a vital improvement for the area.</p>

With remittances outweighing both aid and foreign direct investment in Africa, experts warn that the tax could harm lower-income groups and drive migrants to use unofficial channels to avoid the levy.
