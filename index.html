          <p>Rescue operations in Kerr County, Texas, have been intermittently suspended due to new flood warnings, complicating the search for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flash floods. The initial disaster claimed at least 132 lives, with around 160 people still reported missing in the flood-prone Hill Country. Authorities are urging extreme caution as rising river levels, particularly along the Guadalupe and San Saba Rivers, pose an ongoing and serious threat to both residents and recovery teams. The disaster declaration has been expanded as forecasters predict more heavy rainfall in the already saturated region.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to unfreeze over $6 billion in education funding allocated by Congress. The suit argues the freeze, enacted on June 30, has created chaos for school districts that relied on these funds for the upcoming academic year. The blocked money was intended for numerous programs, including after-school activities, teacher training, and support for English language learners. Democratic officials leading the lawsuit have called the administration's action illegal and politically motivated.</p>

This stricter return-to-office mandate is part of Niccol's broader strategy to turn around slumping U.S. sales by fostering in-person connection and streamlining operations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the "age 75 rule," a common but informal belief that retirees should wait until age 75 to purchase an annuity to secure higher monthly payouts. While it is true that payouts increase with age because insurers anticipate a shorter payment period, the rule oversimplifies a complex financial decision. Waiting until 75 may not be optimal for everyone, as it ignores the immediate income needs of many retirees and the risk of developing health issues that could limit options later. The best time to buy an annuity ultimately depends on individual retirement goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

The author recounts the implementation of a starvation policy and the division of Gaza, which forced many to flee south only to face further destruction. From the author's perspective, the new plan is viewed not as a humanitarian effort but as a pressure tactic against Hamas and a continuation of their suffering. The article conveys a desperate hope for a ceasefire as the only chance for a temporary reprieve from the constant violence and hunger.</p>

          <p>Researchers have uncovered the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania, dating back 3,500 years, at a site on the northern tip of Guam. The discovery was made in the form of phytoliths, which are fossilized plant parts, found exclusively on ancient earthenware pottery within a cave. Experts believe the rice was not for daily consumption but played a role in specialized rituals, given its association with rare rock art and formal burials in the cave. This finding suggests the first settlers of Guam successfully transported and cultivated rice after a remarkable 2,300-kilometer open-ocean journey.</p>

          <p>Detectives investigating the fatal stabbing of a 24-year-old man in London's affluent Knightsbridge neighborhood believe it may have been a targeted attack. The victim, identified as Blue Stevens, was found with stab wounds on Wednesday evening and died at the scene. Police have since arrested three men in their 20s in connection with the murder, one on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and another for murder. While keeping an open mind about the motive, authorities have increased police patrols in the area as the complex investigation continues to unfold.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue color additive for use in foods and beverages, derived from the fruit of the gardenia flower. The color is created by refining a compound from crushed gardenia fruit and is approved for use in products like sports drinks, teas, and candy. This marks the fourth naturally sourced color approved by the FDA in the last two months, aligning with a push from health officials to phase out petroleum-based dyes. The petitioner has also requested an exemption from allergen labeling for the soy protein used in the manufacturing process.</p>

          <p>Two recent federal court rulings in cases brought by authors against AI firms Anthropic and Meta have provided a complex, and at times contradictory, initial legal perspective on AI training. Both judges found that using copyrighted books to train AI models constitutes "fair use" because the resulting technology is transformative and does not directly compete with the original books. However, the judges disagreed on key points, such as whether AI-generated content poses a significant market threat to authors. The rulings also left the companies vulnerable to litigation over their use of "pirate libraries" to acquire the training data.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have been found guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn baby, Victoria, following a lengthy retrial. The couple went on the run with the infant in early 2023 to avoid authorities, leading to a 53-day manhunt that ended with their arrest and the discovery of the baby's body in a shopping bag. The prosecution successfully argued that the baby died from exposure or smothering after the couple subjected her to freezing conditions in a tent.

The incident, part of a series of recent sweeps, has drawn public outrage and led a federal judge to order a halt to indiscriminate raids, citing evidence of racial profiling.

          <p>New research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve suggests the Trump administration's tariffs could increase U.S. manufacturing jobs but ultimately reduce overall national employment and real income. The study modeled the effects of significant tariff hikes on goods from China, Mexico, Canada, and the rest of the world. While some states would see gains, the analysis projected a 0.2% drop in total U.S. employment and a 0.4% decline in real income nationwide over four years, as losses in the services and agricultural sectors would outweigh manufacturing growth.

This move represents a tougher stance from Trump and could force Russia's economic partners to choose between doing business with Moscow or the United States. (not investment advice)</p>
