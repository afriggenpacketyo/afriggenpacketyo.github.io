          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire to de-escalate tensions that have been escalating since an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to announcements from both countries' officials and U.S. President Donald Trump. The agreement was brokered after talks mediated by the United States, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming the involvement of Vice President JD Vance and himself in the negotiations. This decision follows days of cross-border fire and strikes, with each side accusing the other of provocation, which began after an attack on Hindu tourists that India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants. India has denied causing any damage to Pakistan's military infrastructure and rejects Pakistan's claims of destroying the Indian S-400 system.</p>

          <p>Four European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, warning of additional sanctions on Russia if he refuses. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the effort was closely coordinated with the White House, and emphasized the importance of the ceasefire being comprehensive across all domains. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the threat of new sanctions, stating that Russia is accustomed to such pressure. The European leaders also discussed ways to strengthen the Ukrainian military to ensure any future peace deal proves enduring, emphasizing the need for military strength to ensure lasting peace.</p>

          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, and was felt in parts of Georgia and North Carolina, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors, but there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, and earthquakes are not uncommon in the region. In December 2018, a 4.4 magnitude earthquake centered in Decatur, Tennessee, shook homes as far away as Atlanta, indicating the area's susceptibility to seismic activity.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, made an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere after a failed mission to Venus. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the reentry after the spacecraft failed to appear on subsequent orbits. Experts had anticipated that some or all of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive the descent. The U.S. Space Command is still collecting data to confirm the spacecraft's demise, highlighting the challenges of tracking space debris and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled reentries.</p>

          <p>Rochester, New York, a midsize city in upstate New York, is currently the country’s toughest housing market this spring, characterized by homes going under contract in days and multiple bidding wars. Zillow's market heat index ranks Rochester as a tougher place to buy a home than San Francisco, San Jose, Boston, and New York, with a score of 146.5. The median home in the metro area sold for $225,000 at the end of March, up 12.5% from a year earlier, making it relatively affordable for buyers earning $60,000 to $80,000. The region struggles with a deep inventory shortage, with just 913 homes for sale at the end of March, down 8.1% from a year ago.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has directed military leaders to review and remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and 'gender ideology' from their libraries, deeming them incompatible with the department's core mission. This order follows a similar action at military academies, including the U.S. Naval Academy, which removed nearly 400 books. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to purge DEI from the Pentagon, and the Trump administration has been overseeing a widespread culling of anything the White House considers to be DEI within the federal government since January.</p>

          <p>Personal finance guru Ric Edelman is urging Americans to increase their financial literacy and advocating for better financial education in schools. He expressed concern that many young investors are drawn to get-rich-quick schemes and overly complex financial products, and are getting their information from unreliable sources like TikTok. Edelman emphasizes the importance of seeking financial advice from credible sources and being wary of corporate America's tendency to complicate consumer finance. He notes that while 27 states now require high school students to take a semester-long personal finance course for graduation, more needs to be done to prepare young people for financial success.</p>

          <p>A recent equipment failure at an air traffic control facility in Philadelphia exposed years of staffing shortages, underinvestment, and patchwork solutions, leading to significant flight delays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled a plan to replace outdated radar and communications systems across U.S. airspace, estimating that it could require Congress to approve more than $30 billion in funding. The FAA said it would beef up staffing at the Philadelphia facility and work to fix communication lines that feed data to controllers there for Newark flights.</p>

          <p>Businesses across the U.S. are bracing for falling sales as foreign tourists boycott the country, driven by trade tensions and concerns about immigration policy. International visits to the U.S. fell 12% year-over-year in March, and air bookings for overseas summer travel to the U.S. are pacing about 10% behind the same time last year. Experts cite growing concern tied to U.S. immigration policy as a significant factor, with a perception that more travelers are being detained and searched, creating fear and deterring visits. The loss in international tourism is expected to cost the U.S. economy billions this year.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir led to a sudden flare-up of tensions between India and Pakistan, with both countries engaging in missile and drone strikes. The conflict stems from a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, a Himalayan territory divided between the two nations but claimed in its entirety by both. The rivalry dates back to the partition of British India in 1947, when Kashmir's Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh ceded the Muslim-majority region to India. On Saturday, the countries announced they had agreed to a ceasefire after U.S.-led mediation talks.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing increasing pressure to cut interest rates, but is in a 'no-win situation' with threats to both sides of the Fed mandate. President Donald Trump has been urging the central bank to cut rates, insisting that inflation has been slayed, but the president's tariffs have yet to be felt in the real economy. Some economists believe Powell has little choice but to sit tight absent more clarity, given the volatile policy mix. However, history suggests that President Donald Trump's new "Too Late" nickname for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has a strong chance of coming true, though he'd hardly be alone if it does.</p>

Determined not to let go of his home, Velazquez made an unusual choice and camped out in the living room while the alleged squatters took one of the bedrooms.

This trend is driven by the desire to avoid paying benefits and the rise of just-in-time scheduling, where employers schedule the bare minimum number of worker hours they expect to need on a given day.</p>

However, this strategy comes with costs for China, including strained relations with trading partners and the potential for millions of lost jobs.
