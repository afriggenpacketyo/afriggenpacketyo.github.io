        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has called for American commercial and military ships to transit the Panama and Suez canals without charge, directing his Secretary of State to address the matter promptly. Trump asserted that these waterways owe their existence to the United States, while the Panamanian president emphasized that canal fees are governed by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority. Egypt reported a 60% drop in Suez Canal revenues due to Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, prompting ongoing US military actions against Houthi positions to ensure maritime safety. The US and China remain major users of the Panama Canal.</p>

          <p>During the European Fencing Championship in Tallinn, Estonia, members of the Swiss under-23 fencing team turned their backs to the Israeli gold medalists during the medal ceremony as Israel's national anthem played. The Israeli Foreign Minister condemned Switzerland for the protest, which follows previous instances of opponents protesting against Israel's fencing team. In May 2023, Iraq's national fencing team withdrew from a match against Israel at the World Fencing Championship in Istanbul.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's political landscape has dramatically shifted as the Liberal party, led by Mark Carney, has surged in popularity ahead of the upcoming election. This reversal comes after months of Conservative dominance in polls, fueled by voter frustration with the economy and social issues. The resurgence of the Liberals is largely attributed to the return of Donald Trump to the White House and his subsequent tariff threats against Canada, allowing Carney to position himself as a steady hand capable of navigating US-Canada relations. While Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre attempts to distance himself from Trump, Carney is capitalizing on anxieties over potential annexation talk and economic instability.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the shooting death of Amy Fanion, initially reported as a suicide, took a turn when detectives discovered her husband Brian Fanion, a Westfield police detective, was having an affair. Brian Fanion claimed his wife shot herself with his service weapon during an argument, but inconsistencies in his statements and the absence of gunshot residue on Amy's head raised suspicion. Deleted text messages revealed Brian's intimate relationship with Corrine Knowles, leading investigators to question his account of the events. Ultimately, Brian Fanion was found guilty of first-degree murder in what became a highly publicized trial.</p>

While some advocate for strong opposition to the Republican agenda, others believe the party needs to broaden its appeal to more conservative Americans. Figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders are focusing on economic grievances, while Governor Gavin Newsom is attempting to move the party towards the center. A recent poll indicates that a majority of Democrats desire stronger opposition to the Republican agenda.</p>

The anniversary of the Bandung Conference, which promoted cooperation between Asian and African countries during the Cold War, serves as a reminder of this approach. The US undermined the Bandung Conference, pressuring countries to influence their behavior, fearing it would isolate China and give the Soviet Union a platform.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, in collaboration with state law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 immigrants in Florida this week. The operation primarily targeted undocumented immigrants with final deportation orders. This effort is part of the Trump administration's strategy to accelerate deportations, which have not yet reached the administration's desired levels. The operation marks the first instance of a formal arrangement with state law enforcement under a 287(g) agreement.</p>

          <p>Animal rights groups are urging the French government to reconsider rehoming two killer whales, Wikie and her son Keijo, to a sanctuary in Canada after Spanish authorities blocked their transfer to Loro Parque marine zoo in Tenerife. The whales are currently housed at Marineland Antibes, a closed marine zoo in France. The Whale Sanctuary Project proposes relocating the orcas to Nova Scotia, offering them more space and freedom from breeding or performance demands. While Marineland acknowledges the urgency of the transfer, they express concerns about the viability of sanctuaries and the welfare of the whales.</p>

This positions them well to address future needs, particularly at quarterback, and allows them to make trades for established players.
