          <p>A vehicle deliberately drove into a crowd outside a nightclub in East Hollywood, injuring thirty people, with at least seven in critical condition. Police are investigating the crash as an intentional act, noting the driver made a U-turn before accelerating into the line of people. Following the incident, bystanders reportedly pulled the driver from the car and attacked him, with an unknown assailant shooting him before fleeing the scene. The driver was hospitalized, and authorities are searching for the shooting suspect.</p>

          <p>Nearly 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protesters in London, Bristol, Manchester, and other cities displayed placards expressing support for the group, leading to arrests under the Terrorism Act. The ban, which criminalizes support for Palestine Action, followed an incident where activists caused millions in damage to aircraft at an RAF base. The pro-Palestinian group has targeted arms companies it claims are complicit in the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat carrying 53 people capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay, a popular tourist destination, leading to the deaths of at least 34 individuals. Most of the passengers were Vietnamese families, and at least eight of the deceased were children. Rescue efforts, hampered by heavy rain, managed to save eleven people, including a 10-year-old boy found in an air pocket. The Vietnamese government has offered condolences and promised a full investigation into the cause of the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>According to witnesses and hospital officials in Gaza, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to get food, resulting in 32 deaths. The incidents occurred near distribution hubs in southern Gaza operated by the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Eyewitnesses described indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones, while the Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after a group approached its forces. The GHF has become a primary aid distributor amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, but its sites have frequently been scenes of chaos and deadly violence.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced frustration with the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open. Both golfers were warned about their pace during the third round, which they found inconsistent with the handling of even slower play earlier in the tournament. DeChambeau advocated for a more transparent system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness. Stenson highlighted the perceived inconsistency of penalizing a two-minute delay on Saturday after play ran an hour over schedule on the first day.</p>

          <p>This article explores the efforts of Generation Life, a Christian youth organization whose members advocate for "chastity before marriage" to their peers at the Jersey Shore. The activists attempt to connect with other young people by discussing modern relationship challenges, such as the negative impact of social media, before introducing their message of sexual abstinence. The feature delves into how the concept of chastity is being framed for a generation that is already having less sex but is also largely secular and accepting of premarital relations. The group's countercultural stance aims to offer an alternative to what they see as a broken dating culture.</p>

          <p>Economists are assessing the effects of President Trump's tariff policies, noting mixed results more than 100 days after their implementation. The tariffs have generated significant tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing, aligning with the administration's "America First" goals. However, analysts caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs have begun to contribute to price increases in some consumer goods. The ongoing uncertainty and fluctuating nature of the policy create challenges for businesses and risk future inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The possibility of President Trump attempting to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raises complex legal and economic questions with no historical precedent. Legal experts believe Trump lacks the authority to do so without "cause," a standard that would likely be litigated up to the Supreme Court. Such a move could trigger significant market volatility, undermine the central bank's independence, and potentially harden the Fed's stance on interest rates. The article suggests Trump's public attacks may be a political strategy to create a scapegoat for any future economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway claims that "follow your passion" is the worst piece of career advice, arguing that it's a luxury only the already-rich can afford. Instead of blindly pursuing a passion, Galloway advises people to find the intersection of what they are good at and what can be profitable. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting based on skills and opportunities, rather than a single-minded focus on a passion. This approach requires identifying one's strengths and applying them to a field that offers financial stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the recent comeback of tanning culture, linking its rising popularity to a broader ideology within alternative health and right-wing political circles. Figures associated with the Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" movement, like RFK Jr. and Casey Means, are skeptical of mainstream sun-safety guidance and promote the benefits of sunlight. This view aligns with online conspiracy theories that distrust sunscreen and public health institutions. The trend signifies a defiance of scientific consensus, reframing tanning not just as a beauty choice but as a return to a more "natural" and anti-establishment lifestyle.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) and reducing its workforce by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. The ORD has historically provided the core scientific research for the agency's regulations, and critics, including union leaders and congressional Democrats, warn the move will devastate public health protections.

          <p>Much of the United Kingdom is under yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, bringing a continued threat of flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the widespread flooding that was feared. However, the Met Office alerts remain in place for all four nations through the weekend, with new warnings extending into Monday. The recent heatwave has left the ground dry and less able to absorb the heavy rainfall, increasing the risk of localized flooding.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has expressed a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is said to be an initial loan with an option to buy, which would help United manage its wage bill and fund new signings. Rashford has been training separately from the first team after falling out of favor with head coach Ruben Amorim. The 27-year-old England international has spent his entire career at Manchester United, but a move to the Spanish champions is now seen as increasingly likely.</p>

          <p>One month after "Operation Midnight Hammer," the full impact of U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan remains unclear amid conflicting damage reports. The operation used powerful "bunker buster" bombs to target the heavily fortified facilities, which are central to Iran's uranium enrichment program. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported no increase in regional radiation levels, experts note a risk of localized chemical danger from potential leaks of uranium hexafluoride gas. The fate of Iran's existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium is also uncertain.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in previously allocated federal funds, targeting areas like foreign aid and public broadcasting. The vote, which passed the Senate with a simple majority, is being viewed as a significant test case for altering the federal budgeting process. Analysts suggest the move signals a Republican strategy to shift away from the traditional bipartisan, 60-vote requirement for appropriations bills in the Senate. This could enable future budgets to be passed along purely partisan lines, dramatically changing how government funding has been handled for years. (not investment advice)</p>
