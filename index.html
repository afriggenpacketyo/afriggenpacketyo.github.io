          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a high-stakes summit in Anchorage, Alaska, to negotiate a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. The meeting, which lasted over two and a half hours, concluded without a formal agreement being announced. Despite the lack of a concrete deal, Trump stated that "great progress" was made during the discussions and indicated he would update Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the talks. The summit was closely watched internationally, given Trump's previous threats of "severe consequences" if Russia did not agree to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A suspect has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting of a 25-year-old tourist from New York. The victim, Kevin Mares, was visiting Puerto Rico to attend a Bad Bunny concert and was an innocent bystander when he was struck by a bullet at a nightspot in the La Perla community. Authorities allege the suspect, Kalel Jorell Martínez Bristol, fired a gun during an argument with other individuals, injuring two locals in addition to killing Mares.

          <p>San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be legally sold separately from the main property it shares a lot with. This development follows a city law passed last year aimed at creating more affordable homeownership opportunities. Mayor Matt Mahan expressed hope that this new housing model could serve as an accessible entry point into the property market and be replicated by other cities. Amid a statewide housing shortage, ADUs have become increasingly popular, accounting for a significant portion of California's recent housing growth.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the AI transcription service Otter.ai, accusing the company of secretly recording private conversations during virtual meetings without obtaining consent from all participants. The suit alleges that Otter's default settings allow it to record and use these conversations to train its AI, violating federal and state wiretap laws. The plaintiff claims his privacy was severely invaded when a confidential discussion was recorded. This legal action adds to growing user concerns about the platform's privacy practices, particularly its automatic recording features and data handling policies.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Due to declining health, Gabriel could not travel but fulfilled his promise by conducting the Illinois-based band remotely from his home in Virginia. The contract was originally drawn up as a hopeful gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, in the early 2000s. Gabriel, who served in World War II, emphasized the importance of keeping one's word as his motivation for honoring the unique agreement.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the shrinking sea is the primary cause of the region's poor air quality and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that pollution sources are more diverse, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. The report's lead author recommends shifting focus from controlling dust at the source to protecting residents through exposure control, such as improving indoor air filtration.</p>

The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained the change was intended to honor Bryant, who was a Dodgers fan, while staying on theme with the mural. While the tribute has been mostly well-received, it has also generated debate among fans about altering the well-known image of the Lakers legend.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's opening Premier League match against Bournemouth was marked by emotional tributes to forward Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash in July. With Jota's family in attendance, fans at Anfield held up a mosaic spelling his initials and shirt number, sang his song throughout the match, and observed a minute of silence. Players wore black armbands, and goal-scorers Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah dedicated their efforts to their late teammate. The powerful display of support from the club and its fans highlighted the deep impact Jota had during his time at Liverpool.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression has been censored after complaints from the Chinese embassy. The show, held at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, featured works by exiled artists, including pieces related to Tibet, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong, which Chinese officials demanded be removed. Consequently, artists' names and references to these regions were blacked out, and some video works were turned off. The Burmese artist who curated the show and his wife have since fled Thailand and are seeking asylum in the UK, fearing for their safety.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make electric pickup trucks more affordable by selling a simple, barebones vehicle that owners can customize. The base model of the Slate Truck is a compact two-seater, with features like an infotainment system left for the owner to add. The company plans to sell over 100 accessories and make the platform "open source" for third-party additions. However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's starting price may be closer to $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal government's controversial takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the pact, the MPD will remain under the control of its local chief, Pamela Smith, rather than a federally appointed administrator. The agreement, which still allows for federal use of MPD officers in emergencies, came after the city filed a lawsuit seeking an emergency restraining order against what it called a "hostile takeover." The move followed an executive order by President Trump to federalize the force amid a declared crisis.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to formally end President Trump's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, lawmakers including Rep. Jamie Raskin and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton argue that Trump has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required to justify such an unprecedented move. The resolution asserts that the president's actions are a "lawless" attack on the city's autonomy and have worsened public safety by obstructing local funds. The move represents a formal legislative challenge to the president's executive action.</p>

          <p>Scottish jazz pianist Fergus McCreadie initially dismissed calls and emails from acclaimed film director Spike Lee as a scam.

Lee was so interested that he flew to Edinburgh to watch McCreadie perform live before hiring him. McCreadie's track "Stony Gate" is featured prominently in the film's score, marking a surreal and significant career opportunity for the Mercury Music Prize nominee.</p>

          <p>The popular gaming platform "Roblox" is facing several new lawsuits claiming it has failed to protect children from sexual predators and inappropriate content. One federal complaint alleges a 10-year-old was sexually exploited by a predator who posed as a child on the platform. The lawsuits argue that "Roblox" prioritizes profit over user safety and misrepresents its platform as a safe space for kids. In response, "Roblox" has stated it has rigorous safeguards and is implementing new AI tools and age-verification measures to enhance safety, though critics argue these steps are insufficient.</p>
