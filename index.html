          <p>Mortgage application volume decreased by 3.9% last week, despite a slight decrease in interest rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($806,500 or less) fell to 6.92% from 6.98%. Refinance applications also dropped by 4%, though they remain 42% higher than a year ago, while applications for home purchases decreased by 4% but are 18% higher than last year due to increased market supply. The next major market movement may occur with the release of the monthly employment report. Optimism is tempered as rates have remained relatively stable for two months. (not investment advice)</p>

The ECB's assessment marks a shift from the previous year, when Bulgaria's inflation rate was deemed too high, as the country's harmonized consumer price index came in at 2.8% in April. While there are mixed attitudes within Bulgaria regarding Eurozone membership, Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov supports the move.

          <p>South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung is seeking unity amid political division following a short-lived martial law declaration, pledging to serve all citizens and revitalize the economy. Lee's rise to power comes after his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, was removed from office for declaring martial law, a move that sparked outrage and revived memories of military rule. Lee's administration faces challenges, including US trade tariffs and tense relationships with North Korea, China, and Japan.

          <p>Major corporations like Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi are expressing concern about the unsteady business environment due to President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. Court rulings have added another layer of uncertainty, leading companies to put hiring and investment plans on hold. Experts warn that this paralysis could sap momentum from the economy and potentially trigger a downturn. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defends the tariff approach as "strategic uncertainty," while companies warn of potential losses due to the lack of clarity, and consumer attitudes have soured as tariffs take hold.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed criminal charges against former Atlanta police officer Sung Kim in the 2019 death of Jimmy Atchison, citing self-defense. Judge Michael Brown ruled that Kim's actions during the arrest operation were "textbook self-defense," noting that Atchison made a sudden movement towards Kim. Kim, a member of the FBI Atlanta Violent Crime Task Force, was indicted in 2022 on charges including involuntary manslaughter and felony murder. The ruling was based on Supremacy Clause immunity and self-defense immunity, with Kim's attorney criticizing the Fulton County DA's office for an "inexcusable abuse of prosecutorial discretion."</p>

While details on the changes remain unclear, the government aims to address concerns and provide clarity by the autumn Budget. The government insists the original policy was necessary to stabilize public finances, but economic improvements now allow for a partial reversal.</p>

          <p>The German government plans to simplify the process of designating countries as safe origins to reduce the number of asylum seekers. The move, agreed upon by Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government, would eliminate the need for approval from Germany's upper house of parliament when determining if persecution in a country justifies granting asylum. This aims to expedite asylum decisions and address concerns about migration, which has contributed to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. The cabinet also agreed to abolish mandatory legal counsel for asylum seekers facing expulsion.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has faced numerous legal challenges, with judges frequently ruling against his actions due to violations of the law and misinterpretations of legal statutes. The article highlights instances such as the Liberation Day tariffs, efforts to expel immigrants, and attempts to undermine law firms. Critics like Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt have denounced these rulings as judicial activism and tyranny. The article argues that Trump's rejection of judicial review and attacks on the judiciary endanger the separation of powers and judges' safety.</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a former Charles Manson follower imprisoned for 56 years for her role in the Tate-LaBianca murders, has been recommended for parole. The decision marks a significant step for Krenwinkel, now 77, after multiple parole hearings, with commissioners recognizing her growth and concluding she is not a danger to society. However, she still faces potential vetoes from the governor, as has happened in previous cases involving notorious crimes. Supporters emphasize her rehabilitation and the impact of abuse and trauma in her past, while some victims' family members continue to oppose her release.</p>

          <p>A State Department employee, Samuel Samson, published a radical piece on the department's official Substack, accusing European governments of waging an aggressive campaign against Western civilization. Samson, a recent college graduate with no foreign policy background, argued that these nations have abandoned democracy in favor of repressive liberalism. His writing suggests a strategy to infiltrate liberal institutions with right-wing agents who aim to replace liberalism with an illiberal Christian government.

          <p>Oklahoma has implemented one of the most successful public, universal pre-K programs in the US, offering free pre-kindergarten to all 4-year-olds regardless of income. The program's success is attributed to a combination of factors, including a legislative loophole and strategic implementation that avoided disrupting private child care providers. The state's experience demonstrates the potential for universal pre-K to benefit children and working families, with careful planning needed to sustain the private child care industry. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's approach by focusing on how to implement universal pre-K while addressing the needs of the child care sector.</p>

German prosecutors have identified Christian BrÃ¼ckner as a suspect in her murder, though he denies any involvement. The renewed search highlights the ongoing efforts to uncover what happened to Madeleine, but raises questions about whether it is too late to find meaningful evidence.</p>

However, farmers' groups are concerned about the lack of affordable alternatives and urge the EU to present a clear strategy for diversifying fertilizer supply.</p>
