          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating his actions are jeopardizing American health security. In a New York Times op-ed, the bipartisan group, whose tenures span from the Carter to the Trump administrations, cited the recent ousting of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other policy changes as deeply alarming. They argue that Kennedy's agenda, which includes dismantling vaccine systems and canceling mRNA research, has left the nation's leading public health institution on "life support." The former directors are urging Congress to exercise its oversight authority to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS signal disruption, an incident Bulgarian authorities suspect was caused by Russian interference. The event occurred as she was arriving in Bulgaria, forcing the pilots to navigate using alternative methods, though the landing was completed safely. This incident is part of a noticeable increase in GPS jamming and spoofing in Eastern Europe, particularly near Russian territories, since 2022, raising serious concerns among aviation safety agencies about the potential for air disasters. The European Commission condemned the act as a component of Russia's hostile actions and reiterated its commitment to bolstering EU defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal with Crystal Palace for the transfer of England center-back Marc Guehi, pending final clearance from the selling club. The 25-year-old is set to sign a long-term contract after a compromise was reached on the transfer fee, which was initially proposed at £35 million plus a sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has been hesitant to finalize the move until they secure a suitable replacement, having already signed Jaydee Canvot from Toulouse. Guehi's transfer is part of a record-breaking summer spending spree for Liverpool, aimed at strengthening their defense after conceding multiple goals early in the season.</p>

Police had found no evidence of foul play, and her death was considered to be from natural causes.</p>

          <p>Houthi forces in Yemen have detained at least 11 United Nations personnel in raids on UN offices in Sanaa, escalating a crackdown on international aid organizations. The detentions followed an Israeli airstrike that killed several Houthi government officials, prompting vows of revenge from the rebel group. Experts suggest the Houthis are targeting aid workers as a default response to security threats, viewing them as valuable bargaining chips and potential spies amid growing paranoia. Human rights organizations report that this is part of a broader pattern, with dozens of UN staff and thousands of Yemeni civilians having been subjected to forced disappearances in Houthi-controlled areas over recent years.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has devastated remote villages in eastern Afghanistan, with the UN reporting at least 800 fatalities. The quake struck near midnight on Sunday, destroying entire villages in the mountainous Nangarhar and Kunar provinces and leaving residents in shock and despair. A freelance journalist who reached the epicenter described scenes of destruction, with many bodies being recovered from the rubble and survivors too stunned to speak. Rescue efforts are severely hampered by the rugged terrain and roads blocked by landslides, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters while many victims remain trapped.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's decision to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the United States are grappling with severe budget shortfalls and an uncertain future. Stations are launching emergency fundraising drives, and while public response has been strong in some areas, many, especially in rural regions, face potential closure. The funding loss is already leading to staff layoffs and programming cuts, such as the suspension of local public affairs shows in Alaska and Spokane. While national networks are reducing dues and philanthropic efforts are underway, station managers worry that the crisis will worsen over the next year, potentially leaving vulnerable communities without essential news and emergency information services.</p>

The comments highlight a division within the EU on how to approach long-term security for Ukraine.

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to criticize a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has resulted in her celebrated novel "The Handmaid's Tale" being pulled from some shelves. In response, Atwood wrote a story about "very, very good children" who grow up and have a family "without ever having sex," directly mocking the premise of the ban. The move highlights a growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the United States, spreading into Canada.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier reveals that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, have caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals. Researchers analyzed over 225,000 animal bones from the past 8,000 years in southern France. They found that while wild species like deer and foxes have shrunk due to habitat fragmentation and intensified hunting, domesticated species such as sheep and chickens have grown larger through systematic selective breeding.

          <p>The fragile trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under pressure after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs in retaliation for Europe's digital services taxes and technology regulations. Trump has accused the EU of unfairly targeting American tech giants like Google and Meta with its Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. In a social media post, he demanded the rules be scrapped, threatening "substantial additional tariffs" if they remain. The unexpected warning has caught EU policymakers off guard, reigniting trade tensions just weeks after a deal was reached to cap transatlantic tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Warburton, who represented the Somerton and Frome constituency in Somerset as a Conservative MP until 2023, has died suddenly in London at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious after he was found by paramedics at a Chelsea address. Warburton was suspended from the Conservative Party in 2022 over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied and which were later withdrawn. He resigned from Parliament in June 2023 after admitting to cocaine use, triggering a by-election for his seat.</p>

His debut EP, "Gemini," is set for a September release and features a new collaboration with the Dirty Heads, the band he first wrote a hit song with when he was homeless in Los Angeles.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his legal authority by using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not grant the president unlimited authority to set taxes on foreign goods by declaring U.S. trade deficits a national emergency. However, the 7-4 ruling will not take immediate effect, giving the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. The case represents a significant legal challenge to one of the president's cornerstone economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake has caused widespread devastation in eastern Afghanistan, with hundreds feared dead and rescue efforts severely hampered by the region's remote, mountainous terrain. The shallow quake destroyed entire villages built of mud and timber, trapping many residents under rubble, while landslides have blocked road access to the epicentre. The Taliban government is using helicopters for rescue operations but faces immense challenges, as the country's healthcare system has collapsed and international aid is limited following the group's 2021 takeover.

This approach, combined with financial independence where the orchestra generates 75% of its own income, has fostered a deep sense of ownership and motivation among its members. The film follows the ensemble and its acclaimed artistic director, Paavo Jarvi, as they explore the works of Joseph Haydn, a composer whose own journey to artistic freedom mirrors the orchestra's ethos.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies could severely damage key sectors of California's $4 trillion economy. A study by the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced found that industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality are heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce, including a large number of undocumented workers. The report estimates that mass deportations combined with other restrictive policies could put California at risk of losing up to $278 billion from its gross domestic product. This highlights the essential role immigrant labor plays in sustaining the state's economy amid declining birthrates and an aging population. (not investment advice)</p>
