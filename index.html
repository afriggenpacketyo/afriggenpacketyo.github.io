        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung advocates for a deal with Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure." Lee views this as a feasible, realistic alternative to immediate denuclearization, given North Korea's current rate of producing 15-20 nuclear weapons annually. He seeks to reduce tensions and believes mutual trust between Trump and Kim could facilitate renewed talks. The article highlights Lee's pragmatic approach to navigating complex international relations and domestic political challenges, aiming for regional peace and security despite North Korea's past rejections of goodwill gestures.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has explicitly warned Israel against annexing parts of the West Bank, following the UK's recent recognition of Palestinian statehood. This policy change, also adopted by Canada, Australia, and Portugal, is intended to revive the prospect of a two-state solution and ensure security for both Israeli and Palestinian populations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced these actions as a "huge reward to terrorism," a view shared by the US. The article underscores the UK's diplomatic efforts at the UN General Assembly to build consensus for Middle East peace, despite strong opposition and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are facing a mixed open as investors analyze the implications of the Trump administration's recent H-1B visa policy changes. A surprise order increased the H-1B application fee to $100,000, effective Sunday, impacting companies that rely on these visas for skilled foreign workers. This measure, part of an effort to protect American jobs, has caused uncertainty for major tech firms, which recruit extensively from countries like India and China. India has strongly criticized the fee hike, warning of potential humanitarian consequences and disruptions for families.

          <p>Thousands gathered in Arizona for the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was posthumously hailed as a "martyr" by President Donald Trump and other leading conservative figures. Kirk, 31, was tragically killed earlier this month during a campus debate. His widow, Erika Kirk, delivered a poignant speech, publicly forgiving the alleged shooter and emphasizing a message of love over hate, which resonated deeply with the attendees. The article describes the event as a significant gathering for the MAGA movement, blending political rallying with religious homage, and highlighting pledges to continue Kirk's influential work in conservative activism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the complex relationship between birth control pills and women's libido, acknowledging that while the pill ushered in an era of sexual autonomy, some women report a significant decrease in their sex drive. Studies indicate that around 15% of users experience a drop in libido, potentially due to the pill's impact on free testosterone levels. Beyond desire, physical effects like vaginal dryness and emotional fluctuations are also reported by some. The article emphasizes that libido is shaped by multiple factors—hormonal, psychological, relational, and social—and that the effects of contemporary, lower-dose pills vary greatly, making a universal conclusion difficult.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials are issuing urgent warnings regarding "Reggie," a wild dolphin off England's south coast, whose increasingly close and "boisterous" interactions with swimmers are causing significant concern. Experts attribute these alarming behavioral shifts to human habituation, which poses risks to both human safety and the dolphin's well-being. Documented incidents include Reggie nudging individuals and even pushing two women underwater. The article emphasizes that such human interaction can lead dolphins to lose their natural wariness, making them vulnerable to injuries like propeller strikes and potentially aggressive towards people. Authorities strongly advise the public to refrain from swimming with or approaching dolphins to prevent further dangerous encounters.</p>

          <p>China's central bank opted to keep its benchmark lending rates, specifically the one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR), unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. This decision comes despite the US Federal Fed's recent rate cut and aligns with economists' predictions that Beijing would refrain from significant stimulus measures amid a recent stock market rally. The article points to various indicators of economic fatigue in August, including lower-than-expected retail sales and industrial output growth, coupled with persistent wholesale price deflation. The People's Bank of China's cautious stance reflects an effort to balance economic support with broader market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has indicated that media moguls Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, alongside Michael Dell and Larry Ellison, might be involved in a deal to transfer TikTok's US operations to American control. The President shared this during a Fox News interview, characterizing the potential participants as "American patriots." This revelation follows a "very productive call" with China's Xi Jinping, where the final approval for the TikTok deal was discussed. The agreement aims to avert a US ban on the app, which lawmakers deemed a security risk due to concerns over Chinese manipulation of user data. Oracle is expected to manage data and security, with Americans holding a majority on the planned TikTok board. (not investment advice)</p>
