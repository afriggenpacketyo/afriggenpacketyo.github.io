          <p>The Department of Defense is anticipated to deny the majority of the Department of Homeland Security's request for 20,000 troops to assist in arresting migrants, raising concerns about potential violations of federal law. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, a day after joining President Trump at Fort Bragg to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday. Trump delivered a campaign-style speech vowing to use military force to suppress "anarchy" and "liberate" Los Angeles, further fueling the controversy surrounding the deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to the city amid Democratic objections. The current situation is contentious, with legal and political ramifications looming large. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>

Many details emerge over time, such as the expectation that council tax will rise to fund the police in England and Wales, which wasn't explicitly stated. The article suggests that the long-term effects of the Spending Review, including potential budget cuts or unexpected financial outcomes, may take months to fully materialize.

          <p>The House is nearing a final vote on President Trump's $9.4 billion spending cut package, which would codify cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency. The package would allow the White House to claw back billions of dollars already approved by Congress from agencies like USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which funds NPR and PBS. The procedural vote passed along party lines, but the final vote faces potential resistance from Republicans concerned about targeting popular programs. Speaker Mike Johnson's narrow majority means he can only afford to lose a few votes to pass the package. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>
