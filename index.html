          <p>A 39-year-old Pennsylvania woman, Shannon Nicole Womack, is facing multiple charges for allegedly using at least ten different aliases and fraudulent documents to secure nursing positions. The scheme, believed to have started in 2020, spanned several healthcare facilities and possibly other states on the East Coast. Investigators uncovered the fraud during a traffic stop and believe a pattern of medication theft from the facilities was a significant motive. Authorities are now asking healthcare providers to review their records as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>South Korean memory chip manufacturer SK Hynix reported a record-breaking second quarter, with both revenue and operating profit surging due to high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI. The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its revenue climb over 35% and operating profit jump nearly 69% year-over-year. SK Hynix's dominance in the HBM market has allowed it to challenge its rival, Samsung Electronics, for the top spot in the global memory market. The company anticipates continued strong demand and plans to increase capital expenditure in 2025.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified additional documents related to the 2016 election, claiming they show Obama administration officials fabricated intelligence to undermine Donald Trump's campaign. The release, which includes a 2017 Republican-authored House Intelligence Committee report, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and former intelligence officials. They argue Gabbard is misrepresenting the findings and irresponsibly risking the exposure of sensitive intelligence sources and methods. Gabbard has referred the matter to the Justice Department for a potential criminal investigation.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to halt a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest over the next 30 years. The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is intended to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted for territory and resources. Proponents of the resolution argue the culling is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, while some conservationists warn that stopping it will lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has filed a ballot measure proposal to completely repeal the city's gross receipts tax, which generates over $800 million annually. Proponents argue that eliminating the tax, which is levied on revenue rather than profit, will improve the city's "anti-job climate" and make the economy more affordable. However, city officials are sounding the alarm, warning that the loss of revenue would be an "assault on public safety" and could force drastic cuts to essential services like police and fire departments. This move is part of a larger battle between business and labor groups over economic policy in the city.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The policy, signed on the first day of his second term, sought to deny automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants or parents on temporary visas. The court's panel found the order "invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment." This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy, which has been on hold due to multiple lawsuits, affirming that the amendment grants citizenship to nearly all persons born in the U.S.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and allowing the country to avoid a technical recession following a contraction in the first quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% quarterly increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariffs. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, economists remain cautious about the sustainability of this growth, citing ongoing global trade uncertainties. This economic performance may influence the Bank of Korea's future decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The fund was established to protect utility customers and prevent utility companies from going bankrupt if their equipment is found to have caused a fire. Southern California Edison's aging equipment is a leading suspect in the cause of the Eaton fire, which killed 17 people and destroyed over 9,000 structures. With insured loss estimates ranging from $20 billion to $45 billion, officials are exploring strategies to ensure the fund's durability.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, which are designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This interaction creates "space weather," which can disrupt and damage critical infrastructure like satellites, GPS systems, and electrical grids. The identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing researchers to take precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with the magnetosphere. The mission aims to improve understanding and eventually prediction of these potentially hazardous events, helping to safeguard technology and astronauts in space.</p>

          <p>Tesla's second-quarter earnings report revealed a 16% drop in automotive revenue and a 14% slide in vehicle deliveries, marking the second straight quarter of declining sales. The company missed analysts' expectations for both earnings per share and overall revenue, with shares dipping in after-hours trading. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the company could face "a few rough quarters," citing challenges from changing U.S. tariff policies and the upcoming expiration of federal EV tax credits. Amid the slump, Tesla reiterated its focus on future products like robotaxis and announced it began initial builds of a more affordable model.</p>

          <p>A report from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, details the surge in sexual violence being used by armed gangs as a tool of terror and subjugation. With gangs controlling up to 90% of the capital, women and girls are subjected to brutal and systematic assaults, often as part of large-scale attacks on neighborhoods. The article shares the story of a young survivor raising a child born from such an assault, highlighting the profound trauma and lack of resources. Medical charities report patient numbers for sexual abuse have nearly tripled since 2021, as the nation grapples with displacement, hunger, and a near-total collapse of state authority.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the current stock market is defined by a mix of conflicting forces, creating a complex environment for investors. On the positive side, he points to a less severe than feared trade deal with Japan and strong earnings from major banks and tech companies like Alphabet. However, he also warns of negative signs, including "froth" and speculative behavior in some stocks that reminds him of previous market bubbles. Cramer advises investors to remain skeptical but not to exit the market entirely, suggesting there are still strong themes with potential for success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vehicle manufacturing in the United Kingdom has dropped to its lowest point for the first half of a year since 1953, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown period. Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) shows a 7.3% fall in car output and a 45% decline in van production. The slump is attributed to factors including the closure of a major van plant and uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production. While the production of electric vehicles saw a slight increase, the overall outlook remains challenging for the key UK industry.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are beginning their training camp with high expectations, widely regarded as a Super Bowl contender, but they also face several significant concerns. Key issues include managing the health of 37-year-old quarterback Matthew Stafford, who is starting camp with back soreness, and stabilizing the offensive line after a key player's recurring health issues. The team is also counting on its existing cornerbacks to step up and must resolve a contract extension for star running back Kyren Williams. Despite these challenges, the roster is stacked with talent, including young stars Puka Nacua and Jared Verse.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument in California has been altered, becoming the first known casualty of a March executive order from President Trump demanding the removal of "unpatriotic" language from national parks. In 2021, park staff had added information to an existing timeline to provide a more complete history, including the role of Indigenous people and acknowledging the racist views of figures like John Muir. Following the order, these additions were removed, reverting the sign to its original, less comprehensive state, a move critics are calling an act of historical censorship.</p>

The program will be open to those who lost homes, businesses, or suffered injuries or loss of life in the January blaze that killed 19 people. While the official cause is still under investigation, Edison's equipment is strongly suspected, and the utility stated it wants to resolve claims "fairly and promptly." Some attorneys for fire victims have expressed skepticism, suggesting such programs have historically resulted in underpaying victims compared to legal settlements.</p>
