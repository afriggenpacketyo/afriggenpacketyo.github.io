          <p>The House is preparing to vote on President Trump's extensive tax and spending package, but its passage remains uncertain due to divisions within the Republican party. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged that some changes made by the Senate are unpopular with House members, and leadership is actively working to secure the necessary votes. President Trump has been personally lobbying lawmakers, urging them to pass what he calls the "Big, Beautiful Bill," which advanced from the Rules Committee by a narrow margin. The procedural vote on the House floor is seen as a critical test for GOP unity.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man charged with the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is expected to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty. Under the agreement, he would receive four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The victims' families have expressed mixed reactions to the plea deal, with some seeking a full confession and others feeling relief at avoiding a prolonged trial. The deal, which requires Kohberger to plead guilty to all murder counts and a burglary charge, is subject to a judge's approval.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has confirmed it will lay off about 9,000 employees, impacting less than 4% of its global workforce across various divisions. This move is part of a broader organizational restructuring that typically occurs at the start of the company's fiscal year. The cuts follow several previous rounds of layoffs in 2025 aimed at streamlining operations and reducing layers of management. Despite the workforce reduction, Microsoft recently reported strong financial performance with nearly $26 billion in net income for the March quarter, and its stock had reached a record high in late June.

Career coaches advise that creating a clear action plan, such as updating a resume and networking, can help individuals regain a sense of control.

          <p>According to a report from payroll firm ADP, the U.S. private sector experienced an unexpected contraction in June, losing 33,000 jobs against economists' forecasts of a 100,000-job gain. This marks the first monthly decrease since March 2023, raising concerns about the economy's underlying strength. The service sector, particularly in professional services and education, saw the largest declines, while goods-producing roles saw a modest expansion. This data precedes the official government jobs report, which investors will watch closely for a clearer picture of the labor market's health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis projects that homeowner's insurance premiums will increase in all 50 states this year, with a national average hike of around 8%. The trend is driven by the increasing frequency and severity of climate-related disasters, such as wildfires, floods, and storms, which force insurers to pay out more in claims. States like Louisiana, California, Iowa, and Minnesota are expected to see double-digit increases. Experts note that this is a national issue, not just a coastal one, and the rising costs are making homeownership less affordable and stable, impacting household budgets across the country.

He emphasized that this process lies solely with a trust he established, signaling that China should not interfere.

          <p>An essayist provides a first-person account of life in Tehran during a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, documenting the city's atmosphere of fear and the strange sense of normalcy that persists. The diary describes the sounds of anti-aircraft fire, the sight of empty streets, and the personal anxieties of residents, including a pregnant friend confined to bed rest. The author contrasts the terror of explosions and visits to crowded hospitals with moments of human connection and resilience, such as a woman sheltering dozens of abandoned cats.

          <p>As home insurance premiums rise due to an increase in extreme weather events, this article offers practical tips for homeowners to weather-proof their properties and potentially reduce costs. Key recommendations include performing regular roof maintenance or replacement, which can earn substantial insurance discounts, and installing storm shutters to protect windows and doors. Other suggestions involve sealing gaps around windows, clearing outdoor debris to reduce fire risk, and regularly cleaning gutters to prevent water damage. These proactive steps can lower the likelihood of filing a claim, which in turn can help manage rising insurance expenses.</p>

Neguse read a quote from Arrington's own website where he applauded Musk's leadership on tackling the national debt. Arrington defended his position by stating the bill contained significant spending cuts, but conceded it was not perfect regarding fiscal discipline. The exchange highlighted the apparent contradiction for some Republicans supporting a bill projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has ruled that a 176-year-old law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion, allowing the procedure to remain legal in the state. In a 4-3 decision along liberal-conservative lines, the court concluded that comprehensive legislation regulating abortion over the past 50 years effectively superseded the 19th-century statute. The ruling resolves a legal gray area that emerged after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, when abortion providers in Wisconsin had initially stopped services. Abortions can now continue up to 20 weeks of gestation under a law passed in the 1980s.</p>

          <p>DeKalb County, a major Democratic stronghold in Georgia, has appointed a staunch election denier with a history of challenging voter registrations to its board of elections. The county's Republican committee nominated Gail Lee, who has challenged hundreds of voter registrations since 2020 and has publicly stated her belief that Donald Trump won that election. Voting rights advocates have condemned the appointment, calling it a "slap in the face to DeKalb voters" and warning that it places someone who has pushed election lies in a position to oversee future elections in the pivotal county.</p>

          <h2>Modelo Owner Constellation Brands Misses Earnings Estimates Amid Tariff Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 08:40:29 EDT</div>

          <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of popular beers like Modelo and Corona, reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, citing the negative impact of aluminum tariffs on profitability. The company's operating margin declined, partly driven by higher costs for aluminum, a key material for its canned beer imports. Despite the weaker-than-expected quarter and softer consumer demand, which the CEO attributed to socioeconomic factors, Constellation Brands reiterated its financial forecast for the fiscal year. This shows confidence in its ability to navigate the challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>
