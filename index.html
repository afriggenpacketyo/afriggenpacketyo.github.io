          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Bergen County, New Jersey, on Saturday night, with tremors felt across the region, including parts of New York City. The United States Geological Survey reported the quake was centered six miles below the town of Hasbrouck Heights. While the shaking was reportedly felt up to 60 miles away, there have been no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the event. The article notes this follows other minor seismic activities in the area, including a larger 4.8 magnitude quake in the previous year.</p>

          <p>Political observers are discussing whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming 80th anniversary World War II victory parade. Some analysts suggest attendance could foster a tripartite meeting with Russia to help resolve ongoing border disputes, viewing the issue as politically solvable. However, most experts believe Modi is unlikely to participate, despite a recent thaw in diplomatic relations between the two nations. The potential attendance is framed as a significant geopolitical signal with major domestic implications for India and its foreign policy.</p>

He recounts his daily routine in a maximum-security prison, expresses remorse for his actions, and explains his current focus on ministry.

The Hatch Act is a federal law that prohibits government employees from engaging in certain political activities. The article clarifies that the OSC is an independent investigative agency separate from the special counsel role Smith previously held.</p>

          <p>Over three decades after the brutal murder of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, leaving a lasting scar on the community and victims' families. The 1991 crime involved the victims being tied up, shot, and the shop set on fire to destroy evidence. Initial convictions were later overturned, and new DNA evidence failed to match the accused men, leading to their release. Investigators and family members remain hopeful that advancements in DNA technology, focusing on a small male DNA sample found on one victim, may one day identify the killers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a swarm of drones. The system can simultaneously jam enemy communications while creating a protected "storm eye" or null zone for friendly forces. By precisely adjusting signal properties, the drones can cancel out interference at specific locations, allowing allied communications to remain clear. This targeted approach represents a significant evolution from traditional brute-force jamming methods that disrupt all signals within a given range, including friendly ones.</p>

          <p>The collapse of a mountain and glacier that destroyed the Swiss village of Blatten highlights a growing threat to alpine communities caused by climate change. Scientists warn that thawing permafrost, the frozen ground that holds mountains together, is making devastating landslides more frequent and unpredictable. While Blatten's residents were safely evacuated, the immense cost of rebuilding has sparked a debate in Switzerland about whether some at-risk mountain villages should be abandoned. The issue touches on deep cultural identity, as these villages are seen as the heartland of Swiss heritage.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. In an interview, Hill explained that he felt unsuited for medicine and the tragedy made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a job he wasn't passionate about. He recalled feeling out of his depth when breaking bad news to patients and knew he needed a change. This pivot in the early 1990s ultimately led to a successful and beloved career in entertainment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 19:01:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for around £30 million, despite his recent goal-scoring performance in a pre-season match. The potential sale is linked to the club's ongoing interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While United sources state they can make a new signing without first selling players, an exit like Hojlund's would likely be necessary to comply with financial sustainability rules. Hojlund himself has expressed a desire to stay at the club, but his future appears uncertain if a new striker arrives.</p>

          <h2>Meta Signals More Cautious Approach to Open-Source AI Amid China's Advances</h2>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more "careful" with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's aggressive push in the open-source AI ecosystem, which some experts believe could help it surpass the U.S. in the field. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently released powerful new open-source models. The development suggests a strategic divergence in how the world's leading tech powers are approaching AI development and global competition.</p>
