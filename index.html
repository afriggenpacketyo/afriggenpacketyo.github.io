            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering pulling $1 billion in federal funding from Harvard University, escalating the ongoing conflict between the president and the institution. This action follows previous measures, including a request to the IRS to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and a review of federal contracts. Trump has publicly criticized Harvard, accusing it of promoting a radical left agenda and failing to address antisemitism. While some students support the funding cuts, citing Harvard's perceived embrace of controversial ideologies, others defend the university's autonomy and free speech rights. Optimism score: 45</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny after reportedly sharing classified details about a U.S. airstrike in Yemen with a private Signal group, which included his wife, brother, and personal attorney.

            <p>In Japan, an increasing number of couples are entering into nonsexual "friendship marriages" to gain practical advantages, such as social security benefits, while circumventing traditional expectations. These arrangements involve couples with no romantic feelings or sexual desire for each other, often contradicting their sexual orientations. A Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade. While same-sex marriage remains unrecognized in Japan, friendship marriages provide an alternative for those seeking companionship and societal acceptance. Optimism score: 70</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" that was announced by Vladimir Putin, with both sides reporting continued fighting after the ceasefire expired. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russian troops violated the ceasefire nearly 3,000 times, while Russia's defense ministry accused Ukraine of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week, without providing specific details.

            <p>Scientists are investigating the Santorini volcano in Greece to understand the risks of a future eruption, using a research vessel to collect data from underwater vents. The research aims to determine how seawater mixing with magma affects the explosiveness of eruptions. The expedition will create geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency and reveal hazardous areas on the Santorini sea floor. The recent earthquake crisis on Santorini highlighted the island's vulnerability and reliance on tourism, making this research crucial for informing residents and tourists about potential threats.
