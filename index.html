          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are expected to meet the long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the newer, more ambitious goal of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitments must be translated into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark's government has summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report by its national broadcaster alleging that individuals linked to President Trump are conducting covert operations in Greenland. The report, citing unnamed sources, claims the goal is to foment dissent and weaken Greenland's relationship with Denmark, potentially to support U.S. ambitions to annex the strategically important territory. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen stated that any interference in the kingdom's internal affairs is unacceptable. The U.S. State Department noted it does not control the actions of private citizens but described the subsequent diplomatic meeting as productive.</p>

          <p>In response to a sharp increase in threats against members of Congress, a new bipartisan pilot program has been launched to enhance lawmaker security. The program provides a temporary increase of up to $20,000 for security upgrades at their homes and an additional $5,000 per month for hiring personal security. This initiative follows several high-profile incidents of political violence, including an assassination attempt on President Trump and fatal shootings involving Minnesota lawmakers. The program will be evaluated at the end of the fiscal year to determine its effectiveness and future.</p>

The facility has been the subject of lawsuits, one of which successfully halted the transfer of new detainees to the site. The closure of this center, which was visited by President Trump and was estimated to cost around $400 million, comes as Governor Ron DeSantis's administration announces the opening of a new facility called "Deportation Depot." The decision to empty the facility follows significant public and legal pressure.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting that sales growth for the current quarter will remain above 50%. This performance signals sustained high demand for its processors, which are crucial for artificial intelligence infrastructure.

          <p>Experts are warning that intense dust storms known as haboobs, like the one that recently hit Phoenix, are becoming a growing threat in Southern California and the Central Valley.

The storms pose serious health risks, as the dust particles can carry toxic materials like pesticides, heavy metals, and fungal spores that cause Valley fever.

The defeat has amplified questions about his leadership and the effectiveness of the club's expensive summer restructuring, which was built around his famed system. With only 17 victories in 45 games, Amorim's tenure has been disappointing, and his post-match comments suggested a sense of detachment. The result puts the club's senior management, who championed his appointment, in a difficult position as they grapple with the team's poor performance.</p>

The approach gives recipients the autonomy to spend the money on what they need most, such as rent deposits, bills, or debt repayment, which the charity says provides them with the "dignity of choice." The organization reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, with nearly half finding employment, suggesting that direct financial intervention can be a highly effective tool.</p>

          <p>Renowned author Jacqueline Wilson is releasing "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her beloved 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." The new novel revisits sisters Dolphin and Star in their thirties as they continue to navigate life with their mother, Marigold, who still struggles with bipolar disorder. Wilson describes the book as both the easiest and hardest she has written, as she felt a deep connection to the characters but also a responsibility to portray their adult lives with the same realism and emotional honesty that defined the original story.</p>

          <p>Documents released by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) reveal that Ministry of Defence (MoD) staff had been explicitly warned about the risks of sharing spreadsheets with hidden data prior to a major 2022 data breach. That leak exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for resettlement, placing them at risk of persecution by the Taliban. The guidance in place at the time of the incident specifically instructed staff to remove such hidden information, indicating a failure to follow established protocols in a leak that will cost an estimated £850m.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle industry has undergone a massive expansion, positioning the country as a dominant force in the global car market. Companies like BYD have overtaken established players like Tesla in production, fueled by significant government subsidies, lower labor costs, and a robust battery supply chain. This rapid growth has led China to become the world's largest vehicle exporter, prompting regulatory scrutiny and new tariffs from the United States and the European Union, which are seeking to protect their domestic auto industries from the flood of competitive Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>Following Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer pushed back against growing fears of an artificial intelligence bubble. He argued that the massive investments in AI by Big Tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are justified and should not be questioned by investors. Cramer drew parallels to the dot-com era, noting that while many companies failed, a few key players like Amazon survived and went on to generate enormous returns, suggesting a similar outcome for the current leaders in the AI space.

          <p>In a provocative political move, Republicans in the California assembly have proposed a "two-state solution" that would split the state, separating the liberal coastal areas from the more conservative inland regions. The proposal is a direct response to a Democratic-led effort to redraw the state's congressional districts, which Republicans argue would silence rural voices. While the plan to divide California is highly unlikely to succeed, it serves as a powerful messaging tool for Republicans to rally opposition against the redistricting initiative that will appear on the November ballot.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his criticism of late-night television, targeting "Late Night" host Seth Meyers in a series of social media posts. Trump called Meyers one of the "least talented" hosts and questioned why NBC would extend his contract, which was publicly announced back in May 2024. This attack is the latest in a long-running feud between the two, which intensified after Meyers' critical jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. Meyers is a frequent critic of the administration, and late-night comedy remains one of the few platforms consistently challenging the president.</p>

The defections and shifting voter sentiment are creating a significant challenge for Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay, who must decide whether to shift his party further right to counter Reform or risk alienating more moderate voters.</p>
