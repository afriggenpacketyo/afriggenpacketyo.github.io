          <h2>Japan Considers Doubling Rice Stockpile Release to Curb Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 03:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating releasing roughly double its stockpiled rice, totaling about 600,000 tons, to address soaring rice prices. This action follows previous auctions earlier in the year, and the government intends to release 300,000 tons over three months through July. This significant release could reduce the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests. The government is also considering relaxing the buyback requirement for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions, as the current rule discourages participation due to fears of potential rice shortages.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian representatives are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for the first time since the initial weeks of Russia's invasion. While President Zelenskyy had requested Putin's presence, the Russian leader will not attend, sending a delegation led by Vladimir Medinsky instead. President Trump has expressed optimism about the talks and hinted at potential progress and even his own possible attendance. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a diplomatic resolution, stating that there is no military solution to the conflict, and that Trump wants economies and countries focused on building things, making things, providing opportunity and prosperity for its people, and he's against all the things that keep that from happening, like wars, like terrorism and all the instability that comes with that.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a face-to-face meeting between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin in Turkey were dashed as both Putin and President Trump opted to skip the trip. Zelenskyy had expressed skepticism, stating he would decide on Ukraine's steps after seeing who Russia sent, and Trump had urged Ukraine to meet Russia immediately. Despite the absence of the two leaders, senior envoys from the U.S. and a Russian delegation led by Vladimir Medinsky are expected to attend. It remains uncertain whether Zelenskyy will still participate in the talks, which are scheduled to begin soon, as he had conditioned his attendance on Putin's presence.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analyst forecasts. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth primarily to the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the strength of the UK economy compared to other major economies, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized rising employer taxes. Analysts cautioned that the strong growth rate may not be sustainable, especially considering upcoming import tariffs and increased employer taxes.</p>

The Kosovar Association of the Deaf advocates for sign language inclusion in schools, but progress is slow.

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved legislation providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill is necessary to support law enforcement, while Democrats express concerns it could embolden misconduct and disproportionately affect Black people. The bill allows an immunity hearing to determine if an officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties and requires departments to track use of force complaints. The governor is expected to sign the bill into law, sparking further debate and controversy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are unlikely to be a significant factor. The IMF noted that most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders, thanks to a merchanting and processing system. Danish drugmakers rely on intellectual property, contracting manufacturers in other countries, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs. The IMF projects medium-term growth around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

          <p>A version of the Magna Carta held by Harvard University has been confirmed as an extremely rare original, dating back to 1300, according to British experts. The document, purchased in the 1940s for a mere $27.50, is now considered one of only seven surviving versions of the charter issued by King Edward I. Experts from King's College London and the University of East Anglia based their conclusion on the document's size and handwriting, which align with the six previously known originals. The discovery is particularly significant given the current political climate, as the Magna Carta embodies principles of justice and freedom.</p>
