          <p>Billy Joel, the renowned singer-songwriter, has canceled all upcoming concert dates, including a large-scale tour, due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition has caused issues with his hearing, vision, and balance, exacerbated by recent performances. Joel's doctor advised him to undergo physical therapy and refrain from performing during recovery, leading to the cancellation. The 76-year-old singer expressed his apologies to his audience and gratitude for their understanding, with automatic refunds being issued for purchased tickets.</p>

          <p>A proposed GOP tax bill is raising concerns among energy experts due to its potential detrimental effects on decarbonization efforts in the U.S. The bill seeks to repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits, reversing aspects of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Critics argue that these changes could jeopardize up to 330,000 jobs and increase electricity bills for families and businesses. While some Republican senators advocate for continuing energy tax credits, the bill's provisions allowing polluters to avoid oversight by paying a fee are also a cause for concern among environmental policy experts.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a highly influential choreographer of the 20th century and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet for over three decades, has passed away at the age of 98. Grigorovich was renowned for his epic ballets, including "Spartacus," which became a signature piece for the Bolshoi Ballet. His choreography emphasized athletic spectacle and departed from the previously dominant style of Soviet ballet, known as "drambalet." Despite some Western critics finding his work lacking subtlety, Grigorovich was widely regarded as a genius by Russian critics and left a lasting impact on the world of ballet.</p>

          <p>The White House has dismissed a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that claims the Trump administration violated the Impoundment Control Act by blocking $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging stations.

Trump's budget director, Russ Vought, argues that the 1974 law is unconstitutional and accuses the GAO of being partisan.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs following President Trump's renewed trade war rhetoric. Trump suggested imposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., leading to market uncertainty and a flight to safety in bonds. These actions followed a week of bond sell-offs driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and a credit rating downgrade by Moody's, which cited the growing U.S. budget deficit. The market's reaction reflects investor anxiety about the potential impact of trade policies on economic growth.</p>

Padilla was arrested in North Carolina, while Cermeno was initially released after being apprehended in Illinois but later re-arrested on immigration charges.

          <p>A recent study has revealed that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound scans. The study, published in The Lancet, also found that this method can identify tumors smaller than those found by regular mammography. While MRI scans are also effective, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely available. The study suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography could become a standard of care for women with dense breasts at high risk of developing breast cancer.</p>

The Republican-led Congress is considering measures that could reduce the power of judges to hold people in contempt, further complicating the process.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Apple iPhones and goods from the European Union, escalating trade tensions. He suggested a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. and a 50% tariff on EU goods, citing stalled negotiations. These announcements have triggered market concerns, with stocks in the U.S. and Europe declining. The EU has not yet responded, and analysts are uncertain whether the threats will materialize into policy. The U.S. Treasury Secretary hopes these actions will prompt more concessions from Europe.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a bill that includes significant cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), raising concerns about the potential impact on beneficiaries. The legislation aims to reduce Medicaid spending by approximately $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion. Critics argue that these cuts could result in many people losing access to essential benefits. The bill also introduces new work requirements and other measures intended to curb program spending, while simultaneously adding trillions to the national debt.</p>

          <p>U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez is touting the removal of a provision authorizing the sale of public lands in Utah and Nevada from a House Republican bill. Vasquez, co-founder of the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, said the removal is a “huge victory” for Americans concerned about protecting public lands. The provision would have impacted 500,000 acres of land near Zion National Park, along with critical habitat for threatened desert tortoises and other areas designated by Congress for conservation. Environmental groups have applauded the removal, but warn that efforts to privatize public lands are far from over.</p>

          <p>Tarik Shah, a jazz bassist who once played with jazz greats, is attempting to rebuild his career after spending years in prison for plotting to teach martial arts to Al Qaeda fighters. Despite the stigma of his conviction, Shah has regained his freedom and relearned his instrument, but faces challenges in networking and securing gigs. While some in the music community are wary of associating with him, others, like club owner Spike Wilner, are willing to give him a chance based on his musical talent. Shah said playing the bass again is his therapy.</p>
