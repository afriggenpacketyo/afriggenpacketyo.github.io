          <p>Michael Rogers, a top FDA official overseeing drug and food safety inspections, abruptly retired after 34 years with the agency, citing frustration with Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary's leadership. Rogers' resignation comes amid concerns about sweeping cuts to the FDA's inspections workforce ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Makary's plan to expand foreign surprise inspections while cutting trip lengths has perplexed officials, who fear it will strain resources and compromise oversight. Multiple officials have warned of a drain on morale within the agency due to long-running challenges with hiring and retaining investigators, and they have also expressed concern that the proposed changes will lead to corners being cut on oversight.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and runway construction. The FAA has issued ground delays and stops, with arriving flights delayed up to six hours. Staffing shortages at the Philadelphia TRACON facility, which oversees Newark's airspace, have reduced the facility's ability to provide approach control services. Equipment outages, including controllers losing radar and communications, have further exacerbated the situation, leading to trauma leave for some controllers. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule in response to the ongoing disruptions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested tariffs on movies filmed overseas. This initiative aims to counter the industry's shift towards states and countries offering more attractive tax incentives and cheaper labor. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal. The proposal is essentially a tax credit modeled after Californiaâ€™s incentive program. The industry has lost thousands of jobs in the past two years due to generous government incentives and cheaper labor luring film and television studios to shoot many projects far from Hollywood.</p>

These warnings join a growing list of companies expressing concerns about the impact of US tariffs on their operations and the broader economy. Mattel plans to reduce its Chinese imports to the US to below 15% by next year. The US accounts for about half of Mattel's global toy sales. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed new import taxes of up to 145% on goods from China.</p>

          <p>A declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that Venezuela's government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang's operation, the Maduro regime does not direct its activities in the United States. The release of the memo further undermines the administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act. The Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation into media coverage of the intelligence findings, portraying it as misleading and harmful.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Airport. He cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, old technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors. Schumer also questioned a recent bonus offered to air traffic controllers that excluded Washington, Philadelphia, and New York. The problems at Newark Airport have been attributed to a shortage of air traffic controllers, equipment outages, and runway construction. A source indicated that 20% of staff at the air traffic control center in Philadelphia, which oversees the airspace in Newark, walked off the job in frustration late last week.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has begun sending grant terminations to arts organizations following President Trump's proposed budget, which calls for shutting down the agency. The NEA is updating its grant policies to focus on projects that align with the President's priorities, such as supporting HBCUs, celebrating the 250th anniversary of American independence, and fostering AI competency. Local theaters, literary groups, and organizations are receiving either full withdrawals of their federal funding or notices that they can draw down funds until May 31.

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company's South Texas home, Starbase, is on its way to becoming an official city. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters, mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX. The election victory was personal for Musk, whose popularity has diminished since he became the public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts. The creation of an official company town has drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.</p>

Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue.

          <p>Los Angeles County has declared a communitywide outbreak of hepatitis A, with cases tripling in 2024 compared to the previous year. The outbreak is alarming due to the high number of cases and the fact that most infections are now occurring among people who are not homeless, have not recently traveled, or used illicit drugs. Health officials are urging people to get vaccinated against the disease. The highly contagious virus is found in the stool and blood of infected people, and can be contracted by unknowingly ingesting contaminated food and drink. There is a vaccine for hepatitis A, which is recommended for young children and can also be administered to older children and adults.</p>

The state's biggest hurdle may be earning farmersâ€™ trust, as they fear long-term leasing of water shares may be the death of agriculture.
