          <p>President Trump announced at a U.S. Steel facility in Pennsylvania that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. This announcement follows indications that Trump will approve a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The deal involves Nippon investing $14 billion in U.S. Steel, with the headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh and the U.S. maintaining control, and this agreement includes a "golden share" for the U.S. government to ensure production levels are not cut, representing a national security agreement.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is suing President Trump to block his executive order to cut off its federal funding, arguing that it violates the Constitution and federal telecommunications law. PBS claims the order retaliates against the broadcaster for perceived political slights in its news coverage, infringing on speech and press freedom. The lawsuit asserts that the order attempts to control public telecommunications content and distribution, which is prohibited by law.

          <p>Stephen Stanko, a South Carolina death row inmate, opted for lethal injection instead of the firing squad due to concerns arising from a previous execution where the inmate may have suffered due to bullets missing the heart. Stanko had been sentenced to death twice for separate murders, including the beating and strangulation of his girlfriend and the murder of an elderly friend. South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year break due to a shortage of lethal injection drugs, which led to the state adding the firing squad as an option. The inmate's decision comes amid ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding execution methods.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until undergoing newly mandated genetic sex testing, according to World Boxing. The organization is introducing mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers, prompted in part by controversy surrounding Khelif after they won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Concerns arose from the boxer's potential participation in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup in June. The testing will involve a PCR genetic test to determine sex at birth and eligibility to compete, ensuring safety and competitive fairness for all athletes.</p>

          <p>Over the past few decades, Americans have redefined "harm," "abuse," "neglect" and "trauma," expanding those categories to include emotional and relational struggles that were previously considered unavoidable parts of life. Adult children seem increasingly likely to publicly, even righteously, cut off contact with a parent, sometimes citing emotional, physical or sexual abuse they experienced in childhood and sometimes things like clashing values, parental toxicity or feeling misunderstood or unsupported. This cultural shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. Not only must parents provide shelter, food, safety and love, but we, their children, also expect them to get us started on successful careers and even to hold themselves accountable for our mental health and happiness well into our adult years.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge showed price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, possibly reflecting caution in response to higher goods prices. The figures indicate inflation is declining from its post-pandemic peak, though economists warn that widespread tariffs could push prices higher. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs, while a court ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs adds uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" report on the causes of chronic disease in children cited over 500 studies, but several of those studies didn't exist, according to NOTUS. The report described growing rates of health issues, including childhood obesity, diabetes, and autism, and blamed poor diet, lack of activity, stress, and too many prescriptions and vaccines. The White House acknowledged the errors and said the report would be updated, though the secretary has refused to release details about who authored the 72-page report.</p>

          <h2>The TACO Presidency: Trump's Tariff Policy</h2>

          <p>Wall Street has coined the term “TACO trade” to describe President Trump's tendency to announce tariffs but then back down, allowing investors to profit from the market's initial dip and subsequent rally. Trump was reportedly furious upon learning about the expression, which stands for "Trump always chickens out." The article suggests that if Trump stops chickening out, both Wall Street and the American people will face the consequences of his protectionist ideas. This is because Trump's commitment to tariffs doesn't necessarily mean he has carefully prepared for them or thought through their details.</p>

          <p>Canadian officials are warning of tough days ahead for fighting growing wildfires in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with hot and dry weather in the weekend forecast. The wildfires have forced thousands to evacuate, with both provinces declaring states of emergency. Smoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts in Canada and as far as Chicago and the US Upper Midwest. International crews, including firefighters from the US, are assisting in battling the fires, but the forecast does not spell relief any time soon.</p>

Reyes was involved in a dispute with another man who is currently in jail for allegedly physically assaulting him, and authorities are exploring whether the letter was sent to frame Reyes and get him deported.

These layoffs are part of a broader trend of tech companies slashing their workforce, citing reasons such as restructuring, investments in artificial intelligence, and low worker performance. The layoffs affected workers at LinkedIn's offices in San Francisco, Mountain View, Carpinteria, and Sunnyvale, with software engineers being heavily impacted.
