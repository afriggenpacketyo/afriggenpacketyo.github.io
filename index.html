            <p>China's economy demonstrated resilience in the first quarter, exceeding expectations with a 5.4% growth rate despite escalating trade tensions with the U.S. This growth, fueled by policy stimulus and innovation, builds upon the recovery that started in late 2024. Retail sales and industrial output saw significant increases, while fixed asset investment also grew, though real estate continued to be a drag. Despite the positive start, officials cautioned about the complex external environment and insufficient domestic demand, emphasizing the need for proactive macro policies to sustain growth.</p>

            <p>President Trump's administration is facing scrutiny for defying a Supreme Court order to facilitate the return of a Maryland resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. This defiance has ignited a debate about a potential constitutional crisis, questioning the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. Legal experts are divided on whether Trump's actions constitute a tipping point, with some suggesting the system of governance is at risk, while others believe the courts still have tools to enforce their rulings. The case highlights a pattern of the administration challenging court orders and raises concerns about the rule of law.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order to Google, citing unfair trade practices related to search services on Android devices. The JFTC found that Google violated anti-monopoly laws by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize Google's own search apps and services through licensing agreements. These agreements effectively forced manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome, while excluding rival search services. This action aligns with similar crackdowns on Google in the UK and the U.S.</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump, particularly for wire services like the Associated Press (AP). This move comes after a judge ruled that the White House improperly punished the AP for its coverage. The new policy will limit the number of wire service reporters in pool coverage and give the press secretary greater control over who questions the President. The AP and the White House Correspondents’ Association have criticized the policy, arguing that it restricts freedom of the press.</p>

            <p>A new Texas bill, Senate Bill 6, could potentially stall President Trump's "Stargate" AI initiative, which aims to build ultra-powerful data centers across the country. The legislation adds regulatory hurdles and increases costs, leading to concerns that companies may move projects out of Texas. Experts warn that these delays could hinder America's progress in the AI race, especially as China makes rapid advancements in the field. Some economists believe that Texas is playing a dangerous game and that the US could fall behind if the bill passes.</p>

            <p>Since President Trump's inauguration, his administration has faced numerous allegations of violating court orders, raising concerns about the separation of powers. These clashes range from freezing federal funding to states to the removal of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite the allegations, no judge has held a member of the Trump administration in contempt of court, though judges have expressed concerns about compliance. The most recent issue involves the deportation of a Salvadoran native, with the Supreme Court weighing in on the matter.</p>

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China suggests China should avoid increasing trade imbalances and trade tensions by continuing to pursue MIC2025-style policies.
