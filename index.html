          <h2>Expiration of Enhanced ACA Subsidies Could Lead to Sharp Health Insurance Premium Increases in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 06:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis highlights that approximately 22 million Americans could face significant increases in their health insurance premiums starting in 2026. This is due to the scheduled expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, which were established during the pandemic and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act. Without legislative action to prolong these subsidies, average out-of-pocket premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans could rise by as much as 75%. The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that this lapse could result in 4.2 million people becoming uninsured over the next decade, disproportionately affecting lower-income households.

West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed that rescue efforts were unsuccessful and the boy was already deceased when recovered. Police are not treating the death as suspicious and are supporting the family during this difficult time. This tragic incident has prompted renewed warnings about the dangers of swimming in open water, as there have been 18 accidental drowning deaths in the West Midlands region this year, despite signs prohibiting swimming in the lake.</p>

          <p>Indian tennis player Radhika Yadav, 25, was allegedly killed by her father at their home in Gurgaon, a city near New Delhi. According to media reports, her father, Deepak Yadav, confessed to shooting her three times, reportedly because he was troubled by taunts from villagers about living off his daughter's earnings and questions about her character. Radhika, who ran her own tennis academy, was taken to a hospital but did not survive.

          <p>Athletic Bilbao defender Yeray Alvarez has been provisionally suspended after failing a doping test following a Europa League match against Manchester United. The 30-year-old Spaniard stated the positive test was due to the "unintentional" use of a hair loss prevention medicine that contained a banned substance. Alvarez, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2016, described the news as a "very hard blow" but is working with his club to prepare his defense. Both Alvarez and Athletic Bilbao have expressed their confidence in the disciplinary bodies and plan to provide further explanations once the proceedings conclude.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction and confounding analysts' expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the decline primarily to a drop in manufacturing, particularly in oil and gas extraction and car-making, as well as weak retail sales. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures "disappointing" but affirmed her commitment to boosting economic growth. The data adds pressure on the new Labour government, which has made economic recovery a key priority amid concerns over strained public finances and fragile growth prospects.

Additionally, 200,000 people were victims of sex trafficking, approximately half of whom were children.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's recently signed "big, beautiful bill" represents a profound betrayal of his working-class supporters. The author contends that despite Trump's populist rhetoric, the legislation enacts severe cuts to essential services like Medicaid, food assistance, and healthcare, which will disproportionately harm his own base. The piece characterizes the bill as a charade that attaches plutocratic policies to a populist facade, ultimately serving the wealthy while damaging the living standards of the very people who voted for him.

While outwardly appearing as a quiet, high-achieving student, Crooks was privately purchasing weapons, researching explosives, and using encryption services to mask his online activities. In the months leading up to the attack, his internet history showed a fixation on news, ammunition, and secrecy, alongside his normal academic work.

Kasparov argues that the fight to preserve democracy is an existential one, requiring new coalitions that transcend traditional left-right divides.

          <p>This article addresses common concerns about the safety of microwave ovens, clarifying that they do not use the same harmful ionizing radiation as nuclear reactions. Instead, microwaves use non-ionizing electromagnetic waves, which are much less powerful and do not make food radioactive or damage human DNA. In fact, microwave cooking can be one of the best methods for preserving nutrients in food because of the shorter cooking times. The primary risks associated with microwaves are burns from hot containers and food, and the potential for chemicals to leach from unsafe plastic containers, not radiation exposure.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Texas following catastrophic flooding that has killed at least 121 people, while questions mount regarding the local and federal response. Unlike his criticism of officials during other disasters, Trump has avoided blaming Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican ally, and has instead focused on offering support. The visit comes as local authorities face scrutiny over the timeliness of evacuation warnings. Meanwhile, the administration is defending against criticism of budget cuts to the National Weather Service and questions about the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p>

          <h2>Myanmar's Military Gains Upper Hand in Drone Warfare Against Rebel Groups</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 05:52:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Armed rebel groups fighting Myanmar's military junta are reportedly losing their technological advantage in drone warfare. According to a new report, the military has rapidly closed the gap by acquiring advanced drones from China and Russia and deploying powerful jammers that disrupt rebel operations. While resistance groups initially leveraged modified commercial drones to great effect, they now struggle to compete with the junta's superior resources and international support. This shift could impact the trajectory of the civil war, as the military's enhanced drone capabilities are leading to more precise strikes and stalling resistance offensives.</p>

          <h2>Delayed Emergency Flood Alerts in Texas Revealed by Dispatch Audio</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 05:51:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dispatch audio from the recent Texas floods reveals that a firefighter requested an emergency alert be sent to residents in Kerr County approximately one hour before the first warnings were actually received. The dispatcher indicated that supervisor approval was needed for the CodeRED alert. Reports show that while some residents received an alert an hour later, others did not get a warning for up to six hours, a delay that may have contributed to the tragedy. This revelation intensifies scrutiny of the local emergency response to the flash floods that killed at least 120 people.</p>

          <p>American R&B singer Chris Brown has pleaded not guilty to two new charges related to an alleged assault at a London nightclub in 2023. The 36-year-old is now accused of actual bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon, specifically a tequila bottle, in what prosecutors call an "unprovoked" attack on a music producer. These charges are in addition to a more serious count of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, to which he has also pleaded not guilty. Brown, who appeared at Southwark Crown Court, is set to face trial in October 2026.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military leader, Min Aung Hlaing, has publicly praised President Trump after receiving a letter regarding U.S. tariffs, which the junta interpreted as a form of official recognition. In a response letter, the junta chief expressed "sincere appreciation," endorsed Trump's false claims about the 2020 U.S. election, and thanked him for cutting funds to U.S.-backed media outlets. The U.S. has sanctioned the junta for its 2021 coup and subsequent violence, but Trump's letter, sent to multiple world leaders, has provided an opening for the isolated regime to request the lifting of sanctions and seek closer ties.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing Devin, an autonomous AI software engineer from the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment their human workforce, initially handling tasks like updating internal code, with plans to deploy hundreds or even thousands of these AI agents. This move signals a shift towards more powerful "agentic AI" that can execute complex, multi-step jobs independently. While this has the potential to dramatically boost productivity, it also fuels concerns about future job cuts in the financial industry due to automation.</p>

          <p>The newly launched Grok 4 chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI appears to be referencing its owner's public stances when responding to controversial questions. Users have observed that when asked about politically sensitive topics like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or New York's mayoral race, the chatbot's answer-generating process shows it searching for and sometimes citing Musk's posts on X. This behavior, which is not consistently observed across all questions, raises concerns about the neutrality and potential bias of the AI, which Musk has promoted as a "maximally truth-seeking" and "anti-woke" alternative to other models.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The ruling prevents the order from taking effect anywhere in the United States. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to reinterpret the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which has long been understood to grant citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil. The block ensures that the current interpretation of birthright citizenship remains the law of the land while further legal challenges proceed through the courts.</p>

According to a team at the University of Oxford, the object may be three billion years older than our own solar system, originating from the Milky Way's "thick disk" of ancient stars. This is only the third time an object from beyond our solar system has been detected. Scientists are excited by the prospect of studying this seven-billion-year-old visitor, which is expected to become visible with amateur telescopes later this year as it approaches the Sun and develops a glowing tail.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, leaders are advocating for the installation of flood warning sirens as a life-saving measure. Experts agree that sirens are effective for alerting people outdoors, such as campers, but emphasize they are only one part of a comprehensive warning system that must also include cell phone, TV, and radio alerts. For sirens to be effective, the public must be educated on what they mean, and the system needs to be reliable to avoid false alarms. While other countries use sirens extensively, their implementation in the U.S. faces challenges, including high costs and the need for robust public education.</p>

          <p>Despite securing a major legislative victory with his "One Big Beautiful Bill," President Trump now faces the difficult task of convincing voters of its benefits. The 900-page package makes many 2017 tax cuts permanent but also includes significant spending cuts to healthcare and food assistance, while adding trillions to the national deficit. Pollsters suggest the bill is unpopular, and Republicans have focused more on the process of passing it than on explaining its contents to the public. Democrats are already launching ad campaigns highlighting the negative impacts, framing it as a law that benefits the wealthy at the expense of working-class families. (not investment advice)</p>
