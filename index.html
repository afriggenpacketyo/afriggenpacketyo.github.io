          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a significant drop following President Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates preemptively to stimulate the economy. Trump's remarks, made via social media, accused Powell of being consistently slow to respond to economic developments, exacerbating market turmoil already fueled by tariff plans and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all saw substantial losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022, and gold prices reached a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets.

          <p>Lori Daybell, the "doomsday mom" convicted of murdering two of her children, delivered her closing argument in an Arizona trial where she's accused of conspiring to kill her fourth husband. Daybell, representing herself, claimed her brother acted in self-defense when he shot her husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, characterizing it as a "tragic family event." Prosecutors argued the shooting was a ploy to collect Vallow's life insurance and be with Chad Daybell, invoking their religious beliefs as justification. The jury is now deliberating after hearing conflicting accounts of the shooting and the couple's religious views.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions of dollars in federal funding. The lawsuit claims the administration's actions violate Harvard's constitutional rights and academic independence, and are part of a pressure campaign to force changes to the school's policies and leadership. Harvard argues the funding halt will impede critical scientific and medical research, including efforts to improve cancer treatment and infectious disease prevention. The Trump administration has also pressured other universities regarding antisemitism on campuses.</p>

While beneficial for students, this strategy is costly for AI companies, which are already unprofitable.
