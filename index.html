          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 15:09:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, addressed concerns about the company's capital expenditure plans, emphasizing that the substantial investment is driven by significant demand from major hyperscalers for AI infrastructure. In its first earnings report since going public, CoreWeave projected a substantial capital expenditure for the year, exceeding analyst expectations, which Intrator attributes to the company's success in securing contracts and meeting urgent client needs. He also reassured investors that financing remains robust, with lenders continuing to support the company's growth. The company has a growing list of clients, including Microsoft and Nvidia, and recently signed a deal with OpenAI for a five-year commitment of nearly $12 billion, followed by an additional $4 billion deal.</p>

          <p>This article examines the Trump administration's inconsistent policies regarding families and children, highlighting the contrast between granting refugee status to white South Africans and restricting citizenship for American-born children of undocumented immigrants. The administration's pursuit of pronatalist policies, such as "baby bonuses," clashes with its restrictive immigration measures, raising concerns about whether the administration prioritizes certain families over others. Experts suggest these policies cater to a specific political base rooted in white Christian nationalism, while immigration could help grow the workforce, the administration has taken a hardline stance against immigrants from the Global South and their children. The article concludes by emphasizing the racial motivations behind citizenship policies in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data indicates that Republican proposals to cut green tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act could lead to increased utility bills and job losses for Americans. The report, published by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (Ceba), found that repealing these credits would raise the price of electricity and gas, resulting in an economic slowdown. States like New Jersey are expected to experience significant economic losses, with households potentially losing over $1,000 in annual income. The findings suggest that incentivizing private investment in low-cost, reliable energy sources would be more beneficial for economic growth and energy independence.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's evolving approach to US-Israel relations, noting a departure from the enthusiastic support seen in his first term. While still rhetorically pro-Israel, Trump appears less concerned with aligning with Israel on regional issues and has engaged directly with Israel's adversaries, such as Hamas and Iran, without coordination. Experts suggest Trump's focus is on broader regional deals, potentially sidelining Israeli interests, and this shift reflects a growing frustration with allies perceived as taking more from America than they give. The article also highlights the influence of the restrainer wing of Republican foreign policy, who advocate for reducing America's military footprint in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria, the country is experiencing a wave of optimism, but uncertainty remains regarding the extent and conditions of the relief. The end of US sanctions could bring economic relief and reconstruction, potentially encouraging the return of Syrian refugees. However, it is unclear if the sanctions relief will be limited to specific sectors or subject to certain conditions, and Trump has urged Syria to do several things, including signing onto the Abraham Accords and removing foreign terrorists.

          <p>Florida has become the second state to ban fluoride in tap water, following Utah, under a law signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, citing concerns about overexposure to fluoride. The ban, effective July 1, has been met with opposition from dentists and public health advocates, who argue that water fluoridation is a safe and effective way to maintain dental health. Some local governments in Florida, including Miami-Dade County, have already voted to remove fluoride from their water ahead of the statewide ban, and the move follows a push by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to stop fluoridating water.</p>

The study suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced genomes from various ethnic groups and found that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environments, leading to genetic and cultural diversity, and the researcher cited an "urgent case" involving the Kawésqar people of Patagonia, whose population and 6000-year-old cultural heritage is in danger of disappearing.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux, noting that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return anytime soon. He cited the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, which could pose a challenge for the economy and central banks. Powell's remarks suggest the Fed is prepared to maintain higher interest rates to manage inflation and support employment, and he noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

          <p>Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip have resulted in the deaths of at least 114 Palestinians, according to health officials and rescuers, with strikes hitting homes and tents sheltering displaced families. The Israeli military stated it targeted Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in southern Gaza. This intensification of bombardment comes amid US President Trump's visit to the region and ongoing indirect negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Hamas has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining mediation efforts, while an Israeli government spokesman said negotiations would take place while Hamas was under military pressure.</p>

Harvard has been targeted with investigations and funding cuts, leading to concerns about the school's financial stability and academic freedom.
