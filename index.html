          <p>Klarna and StubHub have postponed their initial public offerings (IPOs) due to market instability triggered by President Trump's new tariffs.  The significant market downturn, marked by substantial drops in major indices like the Dow and S&P 500, created uncertainty for these companies.  Both Klarna and StubHub had recently filed IPO prospectuses, indicating their initial optimism for a successful market entry. This delay represents a setback for venture capital firms hoping for a resurgence in the IPO market.</p>

          <p>The Royal Air Force (RAF) has lifted its ban on Tunnock's teacakes after conducting altitude chamber tests.  The ban, in place for 60 years, stemmed from a past incident where unwrapped teacakes exploded in a cockpit due to pressure changes.  The recent tests, however, demonstrated that the teacakes do not pose a flight safety risk, provided they remain wrapped.  The RAF's decision allows the iconic Scottish treat to return to the skies.</p>
