          <p>A six-person Bulgarian cell was sentenced in London for their involvement in a multiyear, multicountry operation to kill investigative journalist Christo Grozev, who had exposed Russian spies and their assassination plots, including the poisoning of Aleksei Navalny. The group, operating out of England, was found with false identity documents and surveillance equipment. The trial marks a rare instance of successful prosecution of Russian agents on British soil, though the sentences were considered lenient by some. The article highlights the vulnerability of individuals facing unchecked power and the importance of continuing to speak out despite the dangers, noting the extensive resources Putin is willing to utilize to silence dissenting voices. Optimism in the face of danger is still possible, though the damage done is a warning.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration expresses confidence in securing investors for the Alaska LNG project, despite its $40 billion price tag, envisioning an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes countries seeking to reduce their trade deficit with the U.S. will invest in American energy, but analysts remain skeptical about the project's commercial viability. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum notes the Department of Defense is prepared to support the project by purchasing gas for military bases in Alaska. The project aims to serve domestic demand initially, given declining natural gas supplies in the Cook Inlet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum lauded the country's first-ever judicial elections as "extraordinary," despite a turnout of only about 13% of eligible voters. The election, championed by Sheinbaum and her predecessor, aimed to elect judges for federal and state positions in a non-partisan manner. Experts attribute the low participation to the off-year election, the convoluted balloting process, and the obscurity of the candidates. Opponents labeled the vote a "festival of voter fraud" and criticized the potential concentration of power in the presidency, arguing that the pro-Morena judges will take their seats regardless.</p>

The economists warn that the bill would increase public debt by over $3 trillion, putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.

          <p>Ukraine has demonstrated remarkable ingenuity and effectiveness in its defense against Russia, particularly through the use of drones. A recent operation involving simultaneous attacks on Russian airfields, including those in Siberia and above the Arctic Circle, highlighted the vulnerability of expensive military assets. The attacks, which reportedly destroyed or damaged more than 40 aircraft, cost Ukraine significantly less than the damage inflicted on Russia. The success of these operations underscores the need for major changes in military strategy and security, particularly regarding drone defense.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain tech startup, Neuralink, has secured $650 million in a new funding round. The fresh capital will help the company bring its technology to more patients and develop new devices that "deepen the connection between biological and artificial intelligence." Neuralink's brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to translate brain signals into commands for external technologies. Currently, five patients have been implanted with Neuralink's technology, enabling them to control digital and physical devices with their thoughts.</p>
