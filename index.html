            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia continued military actions despite President Vladimir Putin's announcement of an Easter truce. Zelensky reported hundreds of shellings and assaults within the first six hours of the supposed ceasefire. He accused Russia of creating a false impression of de-escalation while attempting to advance in certain areas. Zelensky reiterated Ukraine's willingness to extend the truce for 30 days if Russia genuinely commits to a full ceasefire, mirroring any actions taken by Moscow. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these reports.</p>

            <p>Seth Rollins secured a dramatic victory against CM Punk and Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 41, thanks to a shocking turn of events involving Paul Heyman. The match featured intense action, weapon usage, and near-falls, keeping the crowd on the edge of their seats. Heyman, who initially aligned with CM Punk, ultimately betrayed both Punk and Reigns by delivering a low blow and chair shot to Reigns before handing Rollins a chair, paving the way for Rollins to pin Reigns after a final stomp.
