            <p>According to retired PLA Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, mainland China's rise and influence in the international order is unstoppable, with time being on Beijing's side in the Taiwan Strait. Zhou argues that while President Trump pressures Washington's allies, mainland China is focused on building a hi-tech “global navy”. Zhou also examines questions facing Beijing as its status rises on the world stage and addresses concerns about China’s rising international status and its influence in geopolitics and relations with other countries. Zhou highlights that Taiwan is not the only issue driving Beijing's military build-up, as China has two more missions: safeguarding overseas interests and shouldering international responsibilities.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has stated it "resolutely opposes" President Trump's threat of escalating tariffs and vowed to take countermeasures to protect its interests. This comes after Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing doesn't withdraw its 34% tariff on American products. China retaliated with additional tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump's levies, reflecting diminished hopes for a trade deal. Economists suggest that China is prepared for a "full on" trade war with the U.S. and may resort to further retaliatory measures, such as stopping purchases of U.S. agricultural goods.

            <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs indicates widespread concern about a coming recession due to President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with 69% expecting a downturn, the majority of which anticipate it will hit this year. CEOs are worried about the sector-specific issues that will drive up the cost of everything built into strategic growth plans and sold to consumers, to perplexity over the tariffs math and logic, fear of the consequences for American brands worldwide, and outright anger. The survey also revealed that 37% of CEOs expect to cut jobs this year, and almost all CEOs whose companies sell goods and services said price hikes are coming, anywhere from 5% to 20%, and the vast majority (82%) expect "resurgent inflation." The services boom that has driven the U.S. economy to be the envy of the world's markets, led by software, social media and cloud computing, will also be targeted. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Global stock markets experienced extreme volatility following President Trump's tariff rollout, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red. Trump has threatened China with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market, while defending his sweeping tariffs, saying: “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something”. The EU has said it offered the US a “zero-for-zero” tariff deal on cars and industrial goods weeks before Donald Trump launched his trade war, but that it would not wait to defend itself. Trump has announced that the US is to hold direct talks with Iran in a bid to prevent the country from obtaining an atomic bomb, while also warning Tehran of dire consequences if they fail.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for President Trump to use the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged gang members, but the justices mandated that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. The court's majority placed limits on how deportations may occur, emphasizing that judicial review is required. The ruling said the challenge was raised improperly in a Washington DC court and not in Texas, where the migrants are confined. The ACLU claimed the ruling as "a huge victory" because the Supreme Court said individuals must be given due process to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

In other cases, the reason for the revocation is unknown or has not been provided by the administration. The State Department has revoked over 300 student visas nationwide since the beginning of Trump's second term.</p>

Trump also warned that all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with the U.S. on tariffs will be terminated. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has led to a turbulent day on global stock markets, with markets worldwide plunging since Trump announced the global tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the EPA, too, is reviewing "new science" on fluoride. The August report found lower IQ in children who had higher levels of fluoride exposure -- about twice the level recommended limit for U.S. drinking water -- and said more research is needed to determine if the small doses recommended in the U.S. cause harm.</p>

            <p>China has vowed to take “countermeasures” against any move by the United States to further raise tariffs and pledged to take firm action to stabilise the markets, after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap another 50 per cent duty on Chinese imports. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would “provide relending support if necessary to resolutely defend the stability of the capital market”, as officials rushed to contain the fallout from an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies. After plunging on Monday, Chinese markets picked up slightly on Tuesday. (not investment advice)</p>

Observers caution that diplomatic talk aside, there appears to have been few actual gains on contentious sticking points, with core disputes lingering over enforcement mechanisms, geographic scope, legal status and the role of external powers. The Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations issued an unusually tough statement last month, accusing China of “illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions” endangering maritime security.</p>

            <p>At least 22 people have died from flash flooding and tornado damage that swept across multiple states in the the Midwestern and southern parts of the US over the weekend. The fierce weather has caused rivers to swell and the National Weather Service warned that dozens of locations would reach "major flood stage" even as the rain slows down. In Kentucky, a nine-year-old boy was swept away by floodwaters while walking to his school bus stop. In Missouri, 16-year-old volunteer firefighter Chevy Gall died in a crash while trying to rescue people caught in the storm.</p>

Zelensky said "the main objective" was to protect Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv border regions, and to "ease the pressure" on other parts of the vast front line, particularly in the eastern Donetsk region. He thanked several army units defending Ukraine, including the 225th Assault Regiment deployed in the Belgorod region. Russia's military had last month reported Ukrainian attempts to cross over into the Belgorod region - but said such attacks had been rebuffed.</p>

            <p>Days of unrelenting heavy rain and storms killed at least 24 people across seven states, as some rivers rose to near-record levels and inundated towns in already saturated areas of the South and parts of the Midwest.

The storms come after the Trump administration cut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.</p>

Trump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called woke policies are dead. There has been a vigorous campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, and to erase DEI programs and online content.</p>

Andrew Levy, also CEO of the Houston-based airline, said Avelo is flying for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration Control and Enforcement agency as part of a “long-term charter program” to support the agency's deportation efforts. The company decided the move would help with expansion and protect jobs, he said. In New Haven, Connecticut, where Avelo flies out of Tweed New Haven Airport, Democratic Mayor Justin Elicker said he called Levy over the weekend to express his opposition to the arrangement and urged the CEO to reconsider.</p>

The “turquoise alert” system — taking its name from the blue-green mineral — will allow law enforcement to quickly share information. It will function much like “amber” and “silver” alerts that highlight the disappearance of children and the elderly. Cellphone alerts will be issued when law enforcement finds evidence of imminent danger in the disappearance of a Native American.</p>

Senator Mark Warner also said the reported likely deal under consideration would not meet legal requirements for eliminating ByteDance’s influence over TikTok’s US operations under a 2024 law. The reported deal “would preserve a material, operational role for ByteDance by not only allowing it to retain a significant equity stake in the divested entity, but also an active role in technology development and maintenance”, he said.</p>
