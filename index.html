          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s revamped vaccine advisory panel, ACIP, will review long-approved vaccines and the childhood vaccination schedule. Kennedy replaced all members of the group with independent medical and public health experts, including some vaccine critics. The panel will create work groups to review data and develop recommendations, potentially examining the hepatitis B vaccine and the measles, mumps, and rubella shot. Experts like Dr. Sean O'Leary view the review of the vaccine schedule as an anti-vaccine trope and worry about the public losing trust in ACIP. The panel is also evaluating data on COVID-19 and RSV vaccines, aiming to provide evidence-based recommendations on suitable vaccines for individuals and children.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew's lawyer asserts his client's innocence after Morphew was charged with first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in 2020. Suzanne's remains were discovered in 2023, and Barry Morphew is currently held in jail in Arizona awaiting extradition to Colorado. Prosecutors suggest Suzanne's bones were significantly bleached, indicating it was unlikely her body decomposed to a skeleton at the location she was found. Text messages between Barry and Suzanne suggest marital issues, as Suzanne texted she was "done" four days before her disappearance, and Barry Morphew previously filed a $15 million lawsuit against prosecutors and investigators, alleging constitutional rights violations.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man deported and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution, remains jailed as lawyers debate whether the Justice Department can prevent his deportation if released pending trial. Judge Holmes initially ordered Abrego Garcia's release with conditions, but acknowledged he would likely be detained by immigration authorities for removal proceedings. The Justice Department appealed Holmes' order, expressing concerns that deportation would hinder prosecution of his human smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia's lawyers call the deportation concerns a "possible self-inflicted injury" by the Department of Homeland Security, given his previous deportation was deemed an "administrative error."</p>

Republicans, however, are eager to highlight Mamdani's socialist ideas as evidence of the Democrats' shift to the left. While Mamdani's win provides energy and ideas, questions remain about applying lessons from a local primary in a heavily Democratic city to the national stage.</p>

FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated the move aligns with President Donald Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is "not happy" with either Israel or Iran after the opening hours of a ceasefire were marred by reported exchanges. He claimed Iran and Israel both "violated" the ceasefire that he announced, and he continued to push back on an early intelligence report suggesting U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set Tehran's nuclear program back by months. Satellite images showed damage to the Fordo nuclear facility in Iran following U.S. strikes.</p>
