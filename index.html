          <p>Following US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, China's foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the strikes as violations of international law and the UN Charter. The ministry called for an immediate ceasefire, particularly from Israel, and emphasized the importance of ensuring civilian safety and initiating dialogue. China expressed its commitment to working with the international community to promote justice and restore peace in the Middle East. The statement came after President Trump announced the US military had conducted the bombings, while Iran confirmed the strikes but claimed sites were evacuated beforehand. The Chinese government views the US's actions as destabilizing and counterproductive to diplomatic efforts. </p>

          <p>The U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear sites has prompted international reactions, with fears of a broader regional conflict escalating. Israeli leaders praised the strikes, with Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasizing "peace through strength." Iran's military vowed "regrettable responses," while Foreign Minister Araghchi condemned the U.S. action as a violation of the UN Charter. UN Secretary General Guterres expressed grave alarm and urged de-escalation through diplomacy. Allies of Iran, including Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the strikes and pledged to join in retaliation. China's state-run media questioned if the U.S. was repeating its "Iraq mistake," while the U.K. Prime Minister called on Iran to negotiate. The international community is concerned about the potential for further escalation and is calling for a return to diplomatic efforts. </p>

          <p>Following the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have voiced their support for the action, reiterating calls for the removal of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Republic. Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah, stated that the attacks are a consequence of the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons. Maryam Rajavi, from the National Council of Resistance of Iran, emphasized the need for regime change by the Iranian people and the Iranian Resistance, advocating for a democratic, non-nuclear republic with separation of religion and state. The dissident groups believe the strikes highlight the regime's destructive policies and provide an opportunity for a transition to a free Iran. </p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the United States will maintain its strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific region, despite recent military actions in the Middle East. The US military's direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, including repositioning forces, has raised concerns about potential distractions. However, experts believe that Washington's long-term strategic priorities remain centered on China.

          <p>Vox explores the emerging economic populism within the American right, contrasting it with traditional conservative free-market ideology. Oren Cass, founder of American Compass, argues that the Republican Party has been too focused on corporate interests and market fundamentalism. The discussion delves into the role of consumption, the influence of libertarianism, and the differences between conservative and democratic socialism. Cass suggests that the Republican Party is gradually shifting towards a more worker-centric approach, citing policy changes and personnel choices as evidence. The analysis raises questions about the sincerity and potential impact of this paradigm shift within American conservatism. </p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts could have devastating consequences for the San Luis Valley in rural Colorado, where many residents rely on the program for healthcare. The region, one of the state's poorest, depends heavily on Medicaid to support hospitals, clinics, and essential services like cancer and maternity care. The cuts could force difficult choices, potentially impacting access to care and the local economy, as the hospital is the valley's largest employer. Local leaders express concern that reduced Medicaid funding will make it harder to attract healthcare providers and sustain critical services. The community fears a ripple effect, impacting education and other sectors. </p>

The Lib Dems claim the plans will urgently increase the number of trained soldiers. Additionally, Davey calls for a public awareness campaign to prepare British homes for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The proposal aims to address what the Lib Dems see as a need to strengthen Britain's war readiness in the face of threats from Russia and an unpredictable United States. </p>
