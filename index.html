          <p>A rescue operation is in progress for three miners trapped underground following a collapse at the Red Chris mine in northern British Columbia. The workers are located behind a large debris pile but are in a refuge chamber with sufficient air, food, and water. Communication with the trio was lost after a second cave-in, complicating efforts. The mining company, Newmont, has deployed specialized drones to assess the area and is focused on re-establishing contact and safely clearing the passage. Production at the copper and gold mine has been suspended during the rescue.</p>

          <p>Three former Justice Department officials have filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi, challenging their recent firings which they claim were arbitrary and lacked proper justification. The plaintiffs, including a longtime prosecutor on Jan. 6 cases and the department's former top ethics official, argue their terminations violated civil service protections. They received one-page memos citing presidential authority under Article II but no specific reasons for their dismissal. The lawsuit seeks their immediate reinstatement and back pay, asserting that the administration did not follow established procedures for removing career employees.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos posted a dramatic farewell message on social media hours before beginning an 87-month federal prison sentence for fraud and identity theft. In his post, he described his political career as a "wild political cabaret" and thanked both supporters and critics. Santos pleaded guilty to charges including wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, involving fabricated campaign donor reports and fraudulent COVID-19 unemployment claims. Expelled from Congress in 2023, he has remained in the public eye but is now set to serve over seven years in prison.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to experimentally observe the phenomenon of quantum friction between solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not increase with thickness and, in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to how bending the material alters electron movement, restricting energy loss as heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanodevices and advanced quantum materials.</p>

          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe has expressed strong support for the recent declassification of sensitive documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The documents include a 2017 House Intelligence Committee report on Russian activities during the 2016 election, which Gabbard claims shows Obama-era officials manufactured a narrative to undermine President Trump. The release has sparked controversy, with critics like Senator Mark Warner calling it irresponsible and a risk to intelligence sources and methods.

          <p>Princeton, a city north of Dallas, Texas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the nation by the Census Bureau, experiencing explosive population growth. The city's population surged from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 in 2023, driven by affordable housing compared to the surrounding county. This rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines and roads to catch up. With 13,000 more homes already approved, Princeton is projected to reach a population of 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge ruled that the testimony of the complainant, identified as EM, was not credible or reliable, and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The central issue was whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, consented to subsequent acts with the other four. The players' lawyers argued she gave consent, while she testified she was intoxicated and fearful. The high-profile verdict concluded an eight-week trial.</p>

          <p>Desmond Watson, an undrafted rookie defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the heaviest player in NFL history, has been placed on the non-football injury list due to his weight. Coach Todd Bowles stated that the team is working with Watson to get him to a healthier playing condition, but there is no specific timetable or target weight. Watson, who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, had lost some weight before the draft. The team is focused on helping him improve his health so he can get on the field and compete for a spot on the roster.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles is launching a program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration raids. The initiative aims to support vulnerable members of its community who fear arrest and deportation. Archbishop José Gomez stated that many are hard-working people now afraid to go to work or be seen in public. The program will leverage existing church networks developed during the pandemic and is funded by donations, including a significant contribution from businessman Rick Caruso.</p>

          <p>Four traders convicted in the Libor rate-rigging scandal are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo. All were prosecuted for manipulating the Libor interest rate, a key benchmark for inter-bank loans that was central to the 2008 financial crisis. With the new legal precedent set by the Supreme Court, the four traders' appeal is expected to be a more straightforward process. The Serious Fraud Office has declined to comment on the new appeals.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient, Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez, is facing deportation to El Salvador after he made a wrong turn while working as an Uber driver and accidentally crossed the border into Mexico. Although he was out of the U.S. for less than 30 minutes, authorities detained him upon his attempt to return, stating he had "self-deported." His attorney claims border officials solicited an $800 bribe to let him re-enter, an allegation now under review. The case highlights the precarious situation for DACA recipients under current hard-line immigration policies, as he faces removal from the country he has lived in since age 14.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced another bout of severe flash flooding on Thursday due to heavy rainfall. The rushing water forced road closures and led to the rescue of at least five people. The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding because surrounding mountainsides were stripped of vegetation by past wildfires, leaving them unable to absorb the intense summer rain. This event comes less than three weeks after a massive flood in the same community killed three people and caused extensive damage to hundreds of homes.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is affecting Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record last set in 1972. The extreme heat is causing problems for the region's famed reindeer, which are fleeing to roads to escape mosquitoes, and disrupting the local tourism industry built on a cool climate. Scientists attribute the exceptional event to climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet.

The FCC's sole Democrat dissented, calling the deal a blow to press freedom linked to the Trump settlement.
