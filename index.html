          <p>Following a public dispute between President Trump and Elon Musk, some employees of the Musk-founded Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are worried about potential political retribution and damage to their future career prospects. Sources indicate that staffers fear being targeted if the feud escalates and Trump investigates DOGE. Some are reportedly seeking new employment, while tech companies like Coinbase have expressed interest in hiring DOGE alumni. The White House maintains that eliminating waste and fraud remains a priority, with leadership residing in the President and his cabinet. The President has not criticized DOGE, but former Trump advisor Steve Bannon has called for an investigation into Musk.</p>

          <p>Research from Northwestern University suggests that Duavee, a drug used to treat menopause symptoms, may also help prevent breast cancer. A clinical trial involving post-menopausal women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) found that Duavee significantly reduced breast tissue cell growth. Patients taking Duavee also reported fewer hot flashes during the study. Researchers emphasize that these findings are preliminary and more research is needed before the drug can be approved for breast cancer prevention. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a rebound following a heated online exchange between Elon Musk and President Trump, after the stock closed down 14% on Thursday.

Musk's opposition to Trump's spending bill, driven by concerns over the deficit and the removal of electric vehicle tax credits, clashes with the nationalist conservatism embodied by figures like Steve Bannon. This division highlights the tension between free-market principles and a more interventionist approach to economic policy.

          <p>The stock market rebounded following a welcome update on nonfarm payrolls, highlighting the importance of the job market to Wall Street. The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%. Investor sentiment had been on edge following suboptimal reports on the labor market, but the May data eased those fears. The U.S. economy has proven resilient as long as unemployment remains low, and the job data was not weak enough to signal an imminent recession. (not investment advice)</p>

However, critics argue that the ban is part of a demographic-engineering project intended to exclude immigrants from specific ethno-religious backgrounds. The ban's logic is criticized as arbitrary, as it targets countries with high visa overstay rates, often due to conflict or human rights issues.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that fecal microbial transplants (FMTs), a method used to restore gut microbiomes, may introduce unintended health risks. The study, conducted on mice, human tissue samples, and a small volunteer group, found that "mismatches" between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could negatively impact immune and metabolic function. Researchers suggest that greater care should be taken in designing fecal transplants to use specific, targeted microbes for the intestines. While the study highlights potential risks, experts emphasize the need for further research to conclusively assess the negative health outcomes of fecal transplants.</p>
