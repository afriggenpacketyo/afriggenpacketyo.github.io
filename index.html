          <p>The article discusses the factors influencing the price of gold, a commodity often viewed as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge. As of June 10, 2025, the price of gold is $3,343.44 per ounce, but this is subject to constant fluctuations. Factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies all play a role in determining gold prices. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors considering gold as a store of value, portfolio diversifier, or speculative investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves detailed the UK's Spending Review for 2026 onward, outlining impacts on various sectors including jobs, education, and public services. While defense and the NHS will receive significant funding, other areas like the Home Office and Department for Transport will face budget cuts, potentially affecting jobs and wages. The government plans to expand free school meals and invest in community renewal projects, but council tax is likely to rise. A Â£3 bus fare cap will continue, and there will be more help for pensioners in winter, alongside changes to energy bills due to investments in nuclear power.</p>

The inflation rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target, leading to expectations that the Fed will hold off on cutting rates in the near term.

          <p>President Trump announced that a U.S. trade deal with China is "done," pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping, following trade talks in London. The "framework deal" would maintain China's 10% tariffs on U.S. goods, while the U.S. would keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports. The agreement aims to ease trade tensions, with the U.S. seeking increased shipments of rare earth elements from China in exchange for concessions, including allowing Chinese students to study in the U.S. While U.S. officials confirmed the agreement in principle, there was no immediate confirmation from China's government.</p>

This protection is available to players ranked in the top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, emphasized that this rule will alleviate the pressure on players to return to the court prematurely, potentially risking their health. Stephens herself has previously used the off-season to freeze her eggs and believes this policy is a positive step for player well-being.</p>

Annuities are agreements between individuals and insurance companies that provide guaranteed income, often for life. The safety of annuities during market crashes varies depending on the type, with fixed annuities offering the most protection due to their set interest rates, while variable annuities carry more risk due to their market exposure.

          <p>Tensions are escalating between President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) continue in Los Angeles and spread to other cities. LA Mayor Karen Bass issued an overnight curfew for downtown LA, the site of clashes between police and protesters. Trump deployed 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to LA against the wishes of Newsom and Bass, leading Newsom to sue the Trump administration for unlawfully federalizing the California National Guard.</p>

Retailers have indicated they will increase prices due to tariffs, and surveys suggest that many US companies will have to raise prices. (not investment advice)</p>
