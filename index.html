          <p>While President Trump has reportedly expressed a strong desire to be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, his economic policies are drawing sharp criticism from some of the award's past recipients. Nobel-winning economists like Joseph Stiglitz have voiced concerns that the administration's tariff policies and isolationism risk triggering stagflation and are making the U.S. a "scary place to invest." This creates a stark contrast between the president's diplomatic ambitions and the negative assessments of his economic and political impact from esteemed experts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several major companies, including American Eagle, Swatch, and Cracker Barrel, have recently faced public backlash for advertising campaigns and branding changes perceived as tone-deaf or offensive. Critics point to instances like Swatch's use of a problematic gesture and Cracker Barrel's sterile new logo as examples of brands failing to connect with modern consumers. Experts suggest these blunders stem from an empathy failure and the use of outdated corporate strategies to navigate complex cultural issues, rather than a genuine effort to understand their audience.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to accelerate decisions and reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels. A new, independent body staffed by adjudicators will be created to hear cases more quickly, addressing what the Home Secretary called "unacceptable delays" in the current process. This move comes amid increasing public and political pressure to end the costly reliance on hotel accommodation for the 32,000 asylum seekers awaiting a ruling on their cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly opposed reports of a potential Trump administration plan to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, stating there is no emergency that warrants such an action. Pritzker accused the president of "attempting to manufacture a crisis" and politicizing the military to distract from other issues, asserting that the state has not requested federal assistance. Chicago's mayor and other local Democratic leaders have echoed this sentiment, calling the proposed federal intervention uncalled-for and unsound.</p>

          <p>The 2025 US Open is set to begin, with the tennis world focused on whether anyone can challenge the recent dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in the men's draw. Having won the last seven majors between them, they are the clear favorites, though veterans like Novak Djokovic remain formidable contenders. In the women's singles, Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek enters in strong form, while defending champion Aryna Sabalenka and American star Coco Gauff are also expected to make deep runs for the title in New York.</p>

Groups like the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization have seen increased interest since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, reflecting a deep-rooted culture of self-defense. Despite concerns over Russian sabotage like GPS jamming, analysts believe a direct invasion is unlikely due to Estonia's significant defense spending, strong regional allies, and crucial NATO membership.</p>

          <p>The charity Disabled Motoring UK is advocating for all airports in the United Kingdom to eliminate drop-off fees for blue badge holders. The call comes as many airports have raised their "kiss-and-fly" charges, creating an inconsistent and often complex system for disabled travelers. While some airports offer exemptions or discounts, others provide none, leading the charity to argue that people with disabilities are being unfairly charged for necessary access close to terminals and deserve to be treated with more dignity.</p>

          <p>Shane Gorman, who was 18 when his father David died in the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, has dedicated his career to the same field that claimed his father's life. Motivated to understand the catastrophic failures that led to the world's worst offshore oil and gas accident, he became a safety officer, just like his dad. His story is featured in a new documentary that revisits the tragedy, which killed 167 men and exposed systemic safety failings that ultimately reshaped the entire North Sea industry.</p>

          <p>Three previously unknown paintings attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich are causing a stir in the art world after going on display in Bucharest. The works, which could be worth over £100 million if authentic, were purportedly discovered under a pensioner's mattress. However, a leading art scholar has raised significant doubts, pointing to incomplete provenance records and problematic elements in their origin story, while the exhibiting museum has declined to officially verify their authenticity.</p>

          <h2>Parents and Experts Call for Pea to Be Added to UK's Major Allergen List</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 20:37:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There is a growing movement to add peas to the United Kingdom's list of 14 legally mandated food allergens that must be declared on labels. This call to action follows several severe allergic reactions, including a nine-year-old boy who went into anaphylactic shock after eating a hot cross bun containing hidden pea protein. As food manufacturers increasingly use pea protein in a wide variety of products, families and allergy experts argue that the lack of clear labeling poses a serious and growing health risk.</p>
