          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," Senator Chris Murphy accused Republicans of boycotting negotiations to reopen the government, thereby risking a 75% increase in healthcare premiums for many Americans. He argued that this stance is driven by a desire to finance tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations. Murphy asserted that Democrats are demanding a budget that does not devastate middle-class families to benefit billionaires. He characterized the potential premium hikes and other administration actions as emergencies that require an urgent resolution before the government can be funded.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce stated it is "not afraid of" a trade war following President Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing defended its new export controls on rare earth minerals as a legitimate measure, accusing the U.S. of employing a "double standard" and abusing the concept of national security. The ministry emphasized that its controls are not an export ban and that compliant applications will be approved, aiming to limit supply chain impact. This escalation in trade tensions follows a series of high-level talks and has already shaken U.S. stock markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance characterized the Democratic position in the ongoing government shutdown as "hostage-taking," stating that the administration will not negotiate over a healthcare policy dispute while the government remains closed. Appearing on "Face the Nation," Vance blamed the shutdown on Democrats' demands to extend health insurance tax credits, which he claimed are tied to waste and fraud. He asserted that while the administration is willing to compromise on healthcare policy, it will only do so after the government is reopened, placing the responsibility for the impasse and its consequences on Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>The government of Madagascar has announced that an illegal attempt to seize power by force is underway, escalating a period of political instability. An army unit known as CAPSAT, which was instrumental in President Andry Rajoelina's 2009 rise to power, has claimed control of the military command. This development follows weeks of youth-led protests against utility shortages, which have broadened into widespread dissatisfaction with the government over corruption and the cost of living.

Bigelow and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim utilized military advisors, including a retired lieutenant general, to ensure the depiction of the command-and-control procedures was as realistic as possible.

          <p>Brooke Cooper, 33, has been named the general manager of the Worcester Red Sox, making her the first woman to hold that position in the history of the Boston Red Sox franchise. Her journey in baseball began with an internship with the team, an opportunity she secured on her second attempt after an initial rejection. Cooper steadily climbed the ranks from merchandising to marketing before becoming assistant general manager and now the lead executive. She reflects on overcoming imposter syndrome and is proud to be part of an organization where her promotion is seen as a normal step based on merit.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships outlines seven habits to avoid in order to raise mentally strong children. These include rescuing children from every struggle, modeling perfection instead of showing how to repair mistakes, and silencing big emotions. The article emphasizes that mental strength is built by allowing children to face age-appropriate challenges, take responsibility for their actions, and understand that their worth is not tied to achievement. By fostering emotional regulation and autonomy at home, parents can equip their children with the resilience needed to handle life's setbacks.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Rogers, a microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration for 16 years, is one of hundreds of thousands of federal employees currently without a paycheck due to the government shutdown. To cope with the financial uncertainty, she and her two daughters moved in with her mother and she was forced to withdraw from her retirement savings. The family is cutting back on all non-essential spending, and Rogers expresses deep anxiety about her job security and health insurance, noting this shutdown feels different due to threats of permanent cuts. Her story illustrates the personal and stressful impact of the political stalemate on federal workers.</p>

          <p>During a rare press conference in Delhi attended by female journalists, the Taliban’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, was questioned about his government's ban on education and work for women in Afghanistan. Muttaqi claimed that female education is not forbidden under Islamic law but has been "postponed" by order of the supreme leader. He asserted that millions of women and girls are still in some form of education, a claim that journalists were not permitted to challenge. The press conference followed an earlier event from which women journalists were excluded, which Muttaqi dismissed as a "technical issue."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary piece argues that the appointment of conservative provocateur Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is not a sudden shift but the result of a decades-long conservative strategy to influence American media. The article traces this plan back to the 1971 Powell memo, which called for corporations to push back against critical media coverage and promote a pro-business narrative. It details how media executives, including some at CBS, embraced this project, leading to increased consolidation, deregulation, and a media environment more favorable to corporate and right-wing interests. The author posits that Weiss's role represents the fulfillment of this long-term goal to reshape journalism.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a public warning to staff in propaganda departments and other classified units about the danger of leaking confidential information. Citing several instances where state secrets were disclosed by news media, the agency urged departments to strengthen their confidentiality review processes. The warning noted that public information outlets are closely scrutinized by foreign entities and that a lax approach to secrecy in pursuit of publicity could endanger national security.

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that the prime minister's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, had no role in the evidence related to the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The charges were dropped last month after prosecutors said the government failed to provide necessary evidence designating China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. Conservatives have suggested Powell was responsible for withholding this information, a claim the government denies, while insisting the decision rested with the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the ethical dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's anti-transgender stance. The author argues that it is possible to "separate the art from the artist" and still find positive messages of tolerance in the books, despite their flaws. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests a more transformative approach: engaging with the works critically and in community with other fans. This allows for an interrogation of the text's problematic elements while still appreciating its value, turning fandom into a socially productive activity.</p>

After the SNP's majority win in 2011, the UK government agreed to the 2014 referendum. Swinney's strategy, backed by his party, argues that a similar electoral victory would create a mandate that a UK Labour government could not ignore, despite its current opposition to another vote.

          <p>Blaise Ingoglia, Florida's Chief Financial Officer and a loyalist of Governor Ron DeSantis, is leading a new initiative to audit and expose what he calls "excessively wasteful" spending in Democratic-run cities and counties. This move is facing pushback, with officials in Broward County arguing that Ingoglia's claims are based on inaccurate data and ignore unfunded mandates from the state. The initiative is also drawing criticism for its methods, such as when armed officers were sent to the home of a retiree who sent a non-threatening postcard to Ingoglia. Critics view the audits as a politically motivated attack on DeSantis's opponents.</p>
