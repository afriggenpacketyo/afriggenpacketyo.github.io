            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight, citing humanitarian grounds. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy responded cautiously, stating Ukraine would reciprocate if Russia demonstrates a genuine commitment to a full ceasefire, proposing an extension beyond Easter Day. The announcement follows frustration from the Trump administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressing readiness to "move on" from peace talks if progress isn't made. Despite the truce announcement, reports indicated continued fighting along the front lines, and previous ceasefire attempts have failed due to lack of agreement.</p>

            <p>A 27-year-old man was arrested in Utah after allegedly attempting to run a Tesla off the road at speeds exceeding 100 mph in a reported road rage incident. The suspect, Oscar Fayani, was found driving with a revoked license and had active out-of-area warrants; a search of his vehicle revealed drug paraphernalia and cocaine. This incident is part of a larger trend of hostility and vandalism targeting Tesla owners, including harassment at charging stations and politically motivated attacks on dealerships.
