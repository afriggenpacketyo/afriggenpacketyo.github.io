          <p>China is aggressively integrating artificial intelligence into its agricultural sector to enhance food security amidst climate pressures and geopolitical tensions, with a comprehensive 10-year plan focusing on boosting crop cultivation, livestock, and agricultural infrastructure. This strategy aims to address inefficiencies and reduce post-harvest food losses, potentially strengthening China's agricultural technology and AI export sectors. As the world's largest agricultural producer and importer, China's move towards "agriculture+AI" could significantly impact global trade flows and reduce its reliance on imports. China's food self-sufficiency rate has been dropping, from 93.6 per cent in 2000 to 65.8 per cent in 2020. (not investment advice)</p>
