        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temu and Shein are facing significant tariff challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a trade loophole and prohibitive tariffs on China. Despite these hurdles, experts believe that these e-commerce giants will remain competitive by accelerating localization strategies, onboarding U.S. sellers, and leveraging economies of scale through bulk shipments to local warehouses. The article suggests that Temu and Shein's agility and contingency planning will enable them to continue offering competitive prices, even if prices increase to absorb the impact of tariffs. This includes supply chain expansion and focusing on operating with razor-thin margins to maintain competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>There is a reversing trend in China as the children of senior officials are increasingly seeking jobs in the public sector, a departure from the previous trend where they pursued lucrative business opportunities. This shift is attributed to the ruling Communist Party's tightened rules around officials and their families as part of its anti-corruption drive, coupled with a slowing economy. Government jobs are now seen as more appealing due to their security and stability, even though they offer lower pay and more constraints compared to the private sector. This article highlights how political and economic factors are influencing career choices among the elite in China.</p>

          <p>The European Union aims to eliminate all current and future Russian gas deliveries by 2027, presenting a "roadmap" to achieve this goal. This decision follows Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, leading the EU to seek alternative gas suppliers. While there is broad consensus on ending reliance on Russian gas, the complicated unwinding of existing contracts poses challenges. Some European companies have "take or pay" contracts, and unanimous EU support is required to sanction imports, with Hungary and Slovakia opposing the plan.</p>
