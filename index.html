          <p>A Chinese research vessel was observed lowering a pipe-like object into the sea within Japan's exclusive economic zone near the Senkaku Islands. The Japan Coast Guard radioed the vessel, urging it to cease its activities, suspecting it was conducting oceanographic research without prior consent. This incident follows a similar occurrence in October 2023, where a Chinese research vessel was detected performing suspicious maneuvers in the same area. Japan has protested against China's intensifying military activities and maritime assertiveness in the East and South China Seas, particularly intrusions by Chinese vessels into Japanese waters near the Senkakus. The Senkaku Islands are controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing.</p>

          <p>United CEO Scott Kirby addressed concerns about air travel safety following recent radar outages at Newark International Airport, assuring the public that the system is safe due to backup procedures and pilot training. Kirby explained that United has proactively reduced flights out of the schedule in coordination with the FAA to manage capacity and maintain safety margins, especially with runway construction underway. While acknowledging a potential financial impact on United, Kirby emphasized that safety and customer service remain the top priorities. He also noted that while there was a dip in demand beginning in February, the consumer is still cautious but in pretty good shape.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky responded cautiously to Russia's offer of direct talks, calling it a ‚Äúpositive sign‚Äù but insisting on an immediate cease-fire first. This comes after European leaders set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions, with the US also prepared to impose sanctions. Russia rejected the cease-fire proposal, instead suggesting talks in Istanbul, conditional on Western governments ceasing arms supply to Ukraine. Despite this, President Trump praised the diplomatic efforts, expressing hope for an end to the conflict, while Russia resumed drone attacks on Ukraine overnight.</p>

          <p>Democrats are beginning the process of deciding which state will go first in the 2028 presidential nominating calendar. This decision follows President Joe Biden's move to prioritize South Carolina in 2024, leading to debate among traditionally early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, all vying for the lead-off position. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) will ultimately solidify the order, making it a crucial choice for the party as it grapples with its direction after recent electoral losses.

          <p>The United States is scaling back its efforts to promote democracy abroad under the Trump administration, impacting programs that have been sustained by both Republican and Democratic presidents for decades. These cuts include decimating the Agency for Global Media, restructuring the State Department to eliminate a global democracy office, and gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development. Experts warn that this retrenchment could create a vacuum for promoting freedom and representative government, potentially accelerating anti-democratic trends worldwide. Critics also highlight the importance of these programs in ensuring stable, peaceful relationships with other countries and fostering economic cooperation.</p>

          <p>Li-Young Lee's poem ‚ÄòInfant Longing‚Äô delves into profound themes of love, loss, and the cyclical nature of the world, marked by both beginnings and endings, slaughter and innocence. The speaker addresses a loved one, intertwining physical intimacy with existential questioning, and reflects on the memory of his mother, who embodies both the world's end and its new beginning. The poem juxtaposes the intimate act of kissing with the immense longing that transcends time and space, and explores the union of opposites and the search for meaning in a world filled with suffering. It culminates in the recognition of an infinite longing that connects individuals to something beyond earthly existence.</p>

While President Trump hailed the offer as a ‚Äúpotentially great day for Russia and Ukraine,‚Äù others view it with skepticism, suggesting it may be a tactic to prolong the war and test the Western coalition's support for Ukraine.

          <p>The UK government plans to end care worker recruitment from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. New rules will require firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas of overseas workers already in the country, aiming to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers over the next year. The threshold for skilled visas is also expected to be increased, and there will be new requirements for training commitments to encourage domestic workers to enter the labor market.

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is facing growing opposition at home and is using an anti-Ukraine campaign to discredit his political rivals and consolidate support. Orban's government has launched a smear campaign against Ukraine, portraying it as a center of drug trafficking and organized crime, and falsely claiming that its EU accession would endanger Hungary's security and economy. This stance serves Orban's domestic political goals, as he faces increasing public fatigue and a strong challenge from opposition leader Peter Magyar. Orban's anti-Ukrainian rhetoric also aligns with his pro-Russian stance and appeals to far-right voters who harbor revisionist sentiments regarding Ukrainian territory.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that nearly half of Americans are engaged in some form of preparedness for adverse events, suggesting that doomsday prepping is becoming an integral part of American identity. This trend is driven by factors like extreme weather events and a perceived lack of adequate government response, leading individuals to take responsibility for their own safety through consumption choices. While ultra-rich individuals like Mark Zuckerberg are purchasing private islands, middle-class Americans are stocking up on shelf-stable food and considering home fallout shelters. The article explores the motivations behind prepping, from concerns about grid failure to the potential for civil unrest.</p>

          <p>A large-scale air and ground search is ongoing for a 25-year-old British hiker, Eli Sweeting, who has been missing for a week in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park.

Despite challenging terrain, New Zealand Police remain positive, and helicopters, dogs, and locals are assisting with the search, with some of Sweeting's family also flying out to help.</p>

          <p>Emily Howell bid $1,026 on a truck at a Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) auction, primarily because it included a kayak, fishing poles, and a toolbox. However, upon delivery, these items were missing. An internal police investigation revealed that LMPD tow lot employees were caught on surveillance video taking items from cars slated for auction. While Kentucky law states that vehicles impounded for 45 days become government property, the ownership of personal items inside remains unclear, leading to potential theft and disappointment for auction buyers.</p>

The club condemned the "organized vandalism" at the training complex, with footage showing supporters chanting outside and tearing down the entrance gate. Players and staff were forced to remain inside the building, and the club plans to pursue legal action against those who publicly named employees and disseminated private data. The defeat in Vigo left Sevilla 16th in La Liga, six points above the relegation zone.</p>

          <p>British plane parts are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the ongoing trade agreement with the Trump administration. This would include engines from Rolls-Royce and similar components, providing certainty to the UK's ¬£40bn aerospace sector. The deal is also important for the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners. The agreement follows relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs expected to decrease and steel tariffs potentially eliminated. There are hopes to increase the quota on British-made cars beyond the initially agreed 100,000.</p>

Both candidates overcame significant hurdles to run, highlighting the uncertainty in South Korean politics. Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warns that Lee would make South Korea more friendly toward China and North Korea, while Lee promises to end the old era of insurrection and regression.</p>

          <p>Following a US-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, diplomats and foreign policy experts caution that it will take more than just de-escalation to address the deep-seated distrust between the two countries. While the ceasefire is welcomed, experts believe it won't easily lead to enduring peace. Both sides used the military escalation to test the other's resolve, realizing that a full-scale war would inflict massive destruction. The involvement of the US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran as mediators was crucial in achieving the ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study featured in the New York Times Magazine explores how siblings mold each other's personalities, often as much as or more than parents do. The research suggests that sibling influence, known as the ‚Äúsibling spillover effect,‚Äù is particularly strong in disadvantaged families. The article also challenges the validity of birth-order psychology, noting that many qualities attributed to birth order do not hold up in well-conducted studies. Genetic influences also play a role, with genetic inclinations eliciting responses from the world that shape personalities and outcomes, but parenting choices may have less impact than most parents think.</p>

This arrangement raises legal questions about accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign power.

Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have generally dismissed the idea of reducing the consumption tax, which currently stands at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items. The coalition government is currently working to assemble an economic package in anticipation of the House of Councillors election this summer.</p>

Opponents fear the change will erase a long-standing tradition and cater to a less diverse demographic, potentially "whitening" the beach. The city commission and developers maintain that the decision was based on pickleball's broader appeal and that they are exploring options to preserve basketball on the beach.</p>
