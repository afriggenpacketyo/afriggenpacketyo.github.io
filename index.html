          <h2>Dropshipping Businesses Face Pressure Amid Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 23:15:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dropshipping businesses are feeling the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to decreased revenue and logistical challenges. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, has further intensified the pressure. Businesses are now facing inspections and delays at the borders, resulting in customer refunds and slashed profit margins. Some companies are shifting their focus to the European market in response to the tariffs and declining consumer spending in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, as they grapple with whether to devalue their own currencies. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it can also complicate export competitiveness and potentially trigger retaliatory measures from the U.S. administration. Emerging markets face additional risks such as high inflation and capital flight, making devaluation a dangerous option. For now, most central banks appear to be avoiding a currency war that could further destabilize the global economy.</p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates.

Though the dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and France have developed a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region believed to play a role in consciousness. The map shows connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, potentially revealing how this region contributes to cognitive functions. The research also identified differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, offering insights into the evolutionary basis of consciousness. The study aims to improve understanding of how consciousness is generated and why human awareness differs from other animals.</p>

          <p>An experiment has launched into orbit to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) is funding research to develop a pilot food production plant on the International Space Station. If successful, astronauts could soon have access to steak, mashed potatoes, and desserts grown from individual cells. The project is a step towards building manufacturing facilities off-world to support long-term human presence in space.</p>

The lawsuit follows weeks of escalating tensions, with Harvard rejecting the administration's demands to change policies and leadership. The Trump administration has also threatened other universities, citing concerns over antisemitism on campuses. The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration also "failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress required under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring the freeze unlawful."</p>
