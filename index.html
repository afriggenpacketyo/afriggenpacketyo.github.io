          <p>Conservative politician Robert Jenrick is facing criticism for comments made in a leaked recording where he described Handsworth, Birmingham, as an area where he saw few white faces, sparking accusations of racism. Jenrick defended his remarks, stating they were about the importance of social integration and the dangers of "ghettoised communities," not about race. Labour's West Midlands mayor and other politicians condemned the comments as divisive and disrespectful, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch suggested Jenrick was making an observation about a lack of integration.</p>

This move follows a period of sideways trading for the stock after a strong second-quarter performance and is based on the increasing demand for AI infrastructure, which requires significant power generation. The club notes that while the onshore wind business remains soft, the core gas turbine and electrification segments are well-positioned to benefit from the power needs of new AI data centers.

          <p>The European Union has unveiled a plan to shield its struggling steel industry, primarily targeting what officials describe as worsening overcapacity from China. The proposed measures aim to replace an existing safeguard system and will require approval from the European Parliament and Council. While the plan is designed to be comprehensive, EU officials have explicitly identified China as the "biggest problem" in ongoing discussions about global steel production. The new regulations are intended to create a more level playing field for European steel manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) has announced it will appeal FIFA's ruling that found it guilty of "cheating" by fielding seven ineligible foreign-born players in an Asia Cup qualifier. FIFA's Disciplinary Committee suspended the players for 12 months and fined the FAM, alleging the use of forged documents to prove Malaysian heritage. The FAM vehemently denies these claims, stating the players acted in good faith and that FIFA's portrayal is unfair. The case has caused a significant public and political backlash in Malaysia, tarnishing the country's image.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's decision to deploy the Texas National Guard to Chicago, calling it an "authoritarian march." Pritzker, along with the city of Chicago, has filed a lawsuit to block the deployment, arguing that military troops should not be used against American communities. The governor accused the administration of using federal agents and military hardware as "political props" to create chaos and a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act.

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham, Peter Windsor, has been found guilty of stalking television presenter Myleene Klass and her radio colleague Katie Breathwick over a four-year period. The court heard that Windsor sent numerous "unwanted" and disturbing gifts to their London radio studio, including a will-writing kit, handcuffs, and an air pistol. Ms. Klass testified about the "sheer terror" she felt upon learning of the escalating nature of the items. Windsor, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, will be sentenced next month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent drone sightings that suspended flights at Munich Airport have sparked a debate in Germany over which level of government is responsible for drone defense. The discussion centers on whether the federal government ("Bund") or the individual states ("Länder") should have primary authority to protect critical infrastructure. Currently, state and federal police handle such threats, but they lack the military-grade equipment to shoot down drones. Germany's constitution restricts the military's domestic role, preventing it from intervening in non-wartime scenarios, which complicates the response to growing drone-related security risks.</p>

This strategy is complemented by more precise artillery use, carefully planned troop movements, and better rotation schedules to conserve manpower.

The author contrasts billionaires with his grandmother-in-law, who lived near poverty yet was deeply happy because her desires were few. The key insight is that happiness is the gap between expectations and reality; by appreciating the ordinary and managing desires, one can achieve psychological wealth. The piece suggests that the relentless pursuit of "more" often leads to dissatisfaction, while finding contentment with what one has is the actual key to a rich life.</p>

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on Highway 50 in Sacramento, critically injuring the three crew members on board: a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic. The aircraft, which had just departed from the UC Davis Medical Center, experienced an in-air emergency before going down. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the crash. First responders, with the help of bystanders, were able to lift the wreckage to free one of the trapped crew members. The NTSB and FAA are investigating the cause of the incident.</p>

          <h2>Surge in Alternative Capital Allows Startups to Delay IPOs and Stay Private Longer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:14:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Startups are remaining private for a median of 13 years before going public, a significant increase from a decade ago, largely due to the abundant availability of alternative capital. The growth of private equity, venture capital, and other private funding sources, now totaling over $12 trillion globally, provides companies with sufficient capital to mature without the regulatory burdens of being public. This trend has led to a swell in "unicorns" and means that by the time companies do an IPO, they are much larger and more mature. This shift is changing the landscape for both private and public market investors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents across the UK have reported an unusual number of ladybirds swarming in and around their homes, a phenomenon attributed to recent warm weather. Following a chilly start to autumn, a spike in temperatures prompted the insects to seek sheltered places to hibernate for the winter. The most commonly seen species indoors is the invasive harlequin ladybird, which congregates in groups for warmth. Experts note that this year's warm spring and summer led to a boom in aphids, the ladybirds' main food source, which in turn caused the ladybird population to surge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several U.S. airports, including those in Denver, Newark, and Burbank, are experiencing significant flight delays due to shortages of air traffic controllers, a situation exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. With controllers being essential workers, they are required to work without pay, and officials have noted a slight increase in sick calls. At Hollywood Burbank Airport, no controllers were on duty Monday evening, forcing pilots to coordinate with a regional center. The FAA is reducing the number of takeoffs and landings to maintain safety, which directly leads to delays and cancellations for travelers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has appointed Frank Bisignano, the current Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA), to also serve as the CEO of the IRS, a move that has sparked concern among policy experts. Critics worry that having one person lead both massive agencies is unprecedented and could spread leadership too thin, potentially harming services for taxpayers and the 74 million Americans who rely on Social Security. The dual role also raises questions about the separation of sensitive personal data held by each agency. The appointment comes during a period of significant volatility at the IRS.</p>

His role in the team has also shifted with the arrival of Kylian Mbappe and a new coach.

          <p>This article examines the trend of declining fertility rates among Black Americans, suggesting that fears over increasing racism may be a contributing factor. Historically, Black women had higher fertility rates than white women, but this gap has rapidly closed. The author posits that constant exposure to racial animus, both personally and through media, coupled with political rhetoric perceived as hostile, may be leading some Black individuals to forgo parenthood. The piece connects this to historical anxieties and contemporary political realities, arguing that addressing racism is crucial to understanding the broader U.S. fertility decline.</p>

          <p>Ghana is facing a critical healthcare challenge due to the high demand for organ transplants, particularly for kidneys and corneas, and the absence of a legal framework to govern donations. A kidney transplant can cost up to $50,000, and there is a severe shortage of surgeons, forcing many patients to seek expensive treatment abroad. A proposed Organ and Tissue Donation Bill, which would regulate the process and establish a national registry, is pending in parliament. The legislation aims to make transplants safer and more affordable, but concerns remain about policing illegal organ harvesting.</p>

          <p>When deciding between traditional (pretax) and Roth 401(k) contributions, a financial planner suggests that savers should consider their effective tax rate rather than just their marginal tax rate. While the marginal rate is the tax on the last dollar earned, the effective rate is the average tax paid on total income, which is often much lower. Because retirement income may be taxed at a lower effective rate than one's current marginal rate, making pretax contributions could be more advantageous than commonly thought. This calculation provides a different perspective for long-term retirement and tax planning.</p>
