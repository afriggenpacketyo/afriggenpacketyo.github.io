        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate has climbed to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years, driven by factors such as rising rice prices. The Bank of Japan is contemplating a pause in its rate hike policy to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. Economists anticipate a potential easing of core inflation in the coming months due to declining crude oil prices and the strengthening of the yen. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.15% to 143.80 against the U.S. dollar following the release of the inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Road construction in Lubbock, Texas, has led to the discovery of prehistoric megafauna bones dating back to the Ice Age. The Texas Department of Transportation announced the find during an environmental review for Loop 88, a proposed state highway. Among the remains identified is at least one giant ground sloth, with possibilities of mammoth or mastodon bones as well. Archaeologists are also searching for smaller artifacts and using dating techniques to determine the age of the remains, and if any proof of human settlement is found, the project will be temporarily halted.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, drawing criticism for potential conflicts of interest and pay-for-play allegations. The event, held at Trump's golf club in Northern Virginia, offered attendees the chance to interact with the president after investing heavily in the $TRUMP coin. Critics argue that the gala allowed Trump and his family to benefit personally from his position of power, while protesters decried the event as "corruption in plain sight."

          <p>The U.S. Army is resuming horse-drawn funeral carriages at Arlington National Cemetery in June after suspending the practice in May 2023 due to horse deaths and injuries. The Army collaborated with equestrian expert David O'Connor to improve horse welfare and training. Changes include lighter carriages, reduced workload for the horses, and extensive training for unit personnel, with new horses replacing those that have been retired. Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day, totaling about 10 funerals per week.</p>

The report's recommendations, which echo many of Kennedy's long-held views, include concerns about ultra-processed foods, pesticides, and the childhood vaccine schedule.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, testified in an asylum hearing that his deportation from the United States could lead to danger for him and his family. The Trump administration argues that his presence in the U.S. hinders American foreign policy by enabling antisemitism, while Khalil's lawyers contend his detention is retaliation for pro-Palestinian speech. Witnesses argued that Khalil's international prominence would make him a target if deported. The hearing ended inconclusively, with a decision pending after written arguments are submitted.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have included a provision in a domestic policy bill to limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The provision would block federal judges from enforcing contempt citations if they had not previously ordered a bond. Republicans argue the measure is intended to discourage frivolous lawsuits, while Democrats argue it would undermine the courts. The provision's survival is uncertain due to special procedures used to push the bill through Congress.</p>
