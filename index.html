          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's Department of Energy and EPA, alleging a "secret report" on climate change was created to undermine environmental regulations. The report, authored by scientists described as climate skeptics, downplays the severity of climate change and has been criticized by the broader scientific community for inaccuracies and cherry-picking data. The lawsuit claims the panel that wrote the report was formed in secret, violating federal transparency laws, and that its findings are being improperly used to justify repealing key climate protections like the Endangerment Finding.</p>

The hastily arranged summit follows Trump's unsuccessful efforts to broker a ceasefire, with discussions expected to last several hours. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was not invited but welcomed the talks, will be briefed by Trump afterward. The agenda includes complex issues of territorial control and security guarantees, with both sides holding firm to conflicting demands ahead of the meeting.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a defeated Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following the 2022 election, which Peña falsely claimed was rigged. While no one was injured, prosecutors argued the shootings were intended to terrorize political opponents and undermine the democratic process. Peña maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the conviction.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum has addressed the backlash she received for comments made about Caitlin Clark during the WNBA All-Star game. Plum had pointed out that no members of Clark's team attended a meeting about a player-led protest, which many interpreted as a criticism of Clark. Speaking on a podcast, Plum explained that her remark was intended as a lighthearted joke and that she misjudged the serious tone of the moment, which was focused on CBA negotiations. Fans had previously noted that Clark was, in fact, wearing the protest t-shirt during the game.</p>

          <p>A significant backlog is delaying the PSLF Buyback program, which allows public service workers to make retroactive payments for periods of forbearance or deferment to qualify for student loan forgiveness sooner. As of July, over 72,730 applications are pending with the Department of Education, an increase from previous months, leaving many borrowers waiting for months for a response.

          <p>Liverpool held an emotional tribute for the late Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva during the club's first Premier League match of the season at Anfield. Jota, who was 28, died in a car crash in July. Before the game against Bournemouth, fans in the Kop created a mosaic reading 'DJ20', and a period of silence was observed. Liverpool players will wear a 'Forever 20' emblem on their shirts for the entire season in his memory, and the club has retired his number 20 jersey after consulting with his family.</p>

          <h2>Report Indicates Rising Food Inflation is Increasing the Cost of School Lunches</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Deloitte reveals that the cost of packing a school lunch is increasing, with the average price rising to $6.15, up nearly 3% from the previous year. This increase is attributed to broader food inflation, which has driven up the prices of grocery staples like milk and bananas. In response, many families plan to switch to store brands and choose cheaper meal options. The report also notes that the price of meals served in school cafeterias has risen by 3.3% over the last year, though federal programs continue to provide free or reduced-cost options for many students.

          <p>A parenting book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in 1943. The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon with an explanatory letter. The letter writer speculated that their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for an embassy job in 1943, had borrowed the book. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, avoiding what would have been an almost $900 fine.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling hundreds of flights as it prepares for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations with the airline reached an impasse, with a walkout possible as soon as Saturday. The airline stated it has begun a gradual suspension of operations, which could ground its entire fleet and affect about 130,000 travelers daily. Key issues in the dispute include wages and unpaid work time for flight attendants, with the union rejecting the airline's proposal for binding arbitration.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting a strategy to make electric vehicles more affordable with its minimalist, customizable pickup truck. The company's plan is to sell a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but that language was removed after the Trump administration began rolling back EV incentives. The company maintains its simple, low-cost manufacturing approach will remain compelling even without the credits.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is implementing a 21% budget cut after Congress passed legislation that significantly reduced funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a key financial supporter of public media.

The funding cuts are already impacting local stations, with some in New Jersey and California announcing staff reductions.

          <p>Activist hedge fund Starboard Value has significantly increased its stake in Salesforce, causing the company's stock to rally amid speculation of a new activist campaign. Starboard was a key player in a successful 2022-2023 push that pressured Salesforce to improve its profitability and efficiency, leading to a major stock recovery. After a recent period of underperformance, investors are betting that Starboard's renewed interest will again force management to refocus on its core business and avoid dilutive acquisitions.

          <p>A Georgia judge has dropped domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in the "Cop City" demonstrations, ruling that the state violated their right to a speedy trial. The judge found that prosecutors purposefully delayed the case for two and a half years without an indictment, causing "actual prejudice" to the defendant. Marsicano is one of dozens of activists who have faced serious charges, including RICO conspiracy, for their opposition to the controversial Atlanta police training center. This dismissal is seen as a significant victory for the protest movement.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that about one in ten children on Medicaid who visit an emergency department for a mental health crisis end up being stuck there for three or more days. This practice, known as boarding, occurs because of a nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for pediatric patients. The most common reasons for these extended ER stays are depressive disorders and suicidal ideation. Experts warn that ERs are ill-equipped to provide therapeutic care, and prolonged stays in such environments can worsen a child's mental state while they wait for appropriate placement.</p>

The agency stated the task force's goal is to provide recommendations for vaccines that have "fewer and less serious adverse reactions." This is the latest in a series of actions by Kennedy to scrutinize U.S. vaccine policies, including replacing an independent immunization advisory committee with members who are largely vaccine skeptics.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that cloves, a common kitchen spice, may offer several health benefits beyond their use in cooking. The spice contains eugenol, a compound with antibacterial properties that can help control plaque and reduce the risk of gum disease.

Additionally, cloves are a source of essential minerals like calcium and potassium and act as a natural antioxidant. However, experts caution that clove oil and its active compound, eugenol, can be harmful in large quantities and should be used with care.</p>

The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if Congress does not act. This looming insolvency, combined with recent staffing cuts under the Trump administration, has eroded public confidence in the program's future.
