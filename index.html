          <p>An opinion article suggests China is uniquely positioned to influence the future of the Middle East due to its significant economic and military power. The author argues that with its extensive trade and defense relationships in the region, Beijing could leverage its global influence to promote constructive solutions and prevent widespread conflict. This perspective is presented in contrast to the West, which the article claims has failed to prevent multiple conflicts despite advocating for a rules-based international order.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated she would nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully ends the war in Ukraine. Her support is contingent on the condition that a peace agreement does not involve Ukraine ceding any territory to Russia, thereby not validating Vladimir Putin's aggression. Clinton expressed this hypothetical scenario on a podcast, emphasizing her primary goal is to prevent capitulation to Putin and uphold European security interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in young adults achieving key milestones traditionally associated with adulthood. The research, comparing data from 2005 and 2023, shows that fewer people aged 25 to 34 are moving out of their parents' homes, getting jobs, marrying, or having children. The paper attributes this shift to increased economic barriers, such as rising living costs, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation.</p>

The company's strategy focuses on minimizing manufacturing costs by offering a barebones base model, with over 100 optional accessories available for purchase, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate's main challenge will be maintaining its competitive price point, especially as federal EV tax credits are rolled back, potentially pushing its price closer to established competitors.</p>

The indictment alleges she used her position to foster a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, using city funds for personal travel and a city-owned apartment for their meetings. Cantrell and the bodyguard are also accused of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal agents to cover up their actions.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket. He will lead a younger, less experienced T20 squad for a three-match series against Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other senior players are being rested. The appointment is seen as a significant show of faith by England's selectors in Bethell's leadership potential, despite his limited playing time this summer and lack of senior-level captaincy experience.</p>

          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy. The suit alleges that a new report on climate change, used to justify repealing the 2009 Endangerment Finding, was secretly produced by a panel of "known climate contrarians" in violation of federal transparency laws. Critics and independent scientists argue the report is full of inaccuracies, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and serves a political goal to undermine climate regulations.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are holding a high-stakes summit at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine.

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell by 14% after the company issued a weak financial forecast for the upcoming quarter. The guidance fell short of analyst expectations, with the company citing growing uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China. CEO Gary Dickerson also noted that weakness from leading-edge customers and a slowdown in spending by Chinese clients contributed to the cautious outlook, prompting a stock downgrade from Bank of America.</p>

          <p>The cost of packing a school lunch is rising for American families, according to a new report from Deloitte, which finds the average homemade lunch now costs $6.15, up nearly 3% from last year.

The report also notes that the price of cafeteria lunches is rising, prompting the USDA to increase funding for school meal programs to help offset the impact on families.</p>

The book, "Your Child, His Family, and Friends," was mailed back with a letter from a person who found it among their late father's belongings. The letter writer explained that their grandmother likely borrowed the book before moving to Mexico City for work and humorously hoped there would be no late fee.

The research, which analyzed Medicaid data, found this "boarding" occurs in about one-tenth of all pediatric mental health emergency visits, with depressive disorders and suicidal thoughts being the most common reasons. Experts attribute this dangerous bottleneck to a nationwide shortage of pediatric psychiatric beds and inadequate outpatient mental health services for children.</p>
