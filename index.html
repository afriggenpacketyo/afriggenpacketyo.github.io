          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian commercial port near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least 25 deaths and 800 injuries. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, caused widespread damage to nearby buildings and vehicles, with residents reporting the impact felt up to 50 kilometers away. Initial reports suggested the fire originated from improperly stored flammable materials, potentially solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles. Iranian officials had previously issued warnings about the unsafe storage of chemicals at the port, raising questions about safety protocols. Optimism is low as there is a large loss of human life and a potential coverup regarding the cause of the explosion.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. defeated Conor Benn after a grueling 12-round match at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, a victory made more poignant by the reconciliation of Eubank Jr. with his father, Chris Eubank Sr., after years of estrangement. The fight, steeped in the history of their fathers' rivalry, saw Benn take the defeat with grace, acknowledging the importance of family relationships. The emotional moment underscored the personal stakes involved, with Benn stating he'd choose a relationship with his father over boxing any day. While the spectacle captivated the nation, the future for both fighters remains uncertain, especially considering Benn's past doping scandal.</p>

          <p>A letter penned by Titanic passenger Colonel Archibald Gracie just days before the ship's sinking sold for £300,000 at auction in the UK, surpassing expectations. The letter, dated April 10, 1912, was purchased by an anonymous buyer. It contains a prescient comment about awaiting his journey's end before judging the "fine ship." Gracie survived the disaster, adding historical weight and emotional resonance to the document.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case involving Trina Martin, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by FBI agents in 2017. Agents broke down the door and pointed guns at Martin and her boyfriend while her son screamed from another room, only to realize they had the wrong house. The key legal issue is under what circumstances individuals can sue the federal government to hold law enforcement accountable. Martin's attorneys argue that Congress intended to allow such lawsuits and that denying them would leave families with little recourse.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that Donald Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years. The poll reveals public disapproval of many of his policies and widespread economic discontent, including fears of a recession. While negative views on the economy are prevalent, Trump still fares better than the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems. The results suggest a challenging start to his term, marked by both policy resistance and economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating capping the number of international students as a measure to address its growing housing crisis. Politicians are considering this move to reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, aiming to ease affordability issues for voters. This represents a significant shift for Australia, which has historically promoted international education as a key economic sector. The potential caps have raised concerns about the impact on universities and the broader economy, with some advocating for improved selection criteria rather than blanket restrictions.</p>
