          <p>Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based bioscience company with no revenue, experienced a surge in trading demand, with its stock rising over 58,000% year-to-date. The company develops traditional Chinese herb treatments for childhood ADHD and autism, and its market value briefly surpassed Lululemon, eBay, and Kraft Heinz. The stock's volatility is notable, with huge one-day swings, and the CEO controls a significant portion of the outstanding shares. The surge occurred amidst increased focus on alternative medicines and online buzz, with some investors expressing skepticism. Optimism regarding the company's future remains uncertain due to the lack of revenue and regulatory approvals.</p>

          <p>R&B singer R. Kelly was reportedly hospitalized after an alleged "overdose" caused by officials at a North Carolina prison, according to his lawyers, though sources claim it was for routine medical care. Kelly is serving a 30-year sentence after being convicted in 2021 on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. His attorney alleges mismanagement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, including denial of surgery.

          <p>Prosecutors allege that Jeff Pelley, an Indiana teenager, murdered his family in 1989 due to an argument over prom restrictions imposed by his father. Jeff was reportedly upset that his father was driving him to prom and preventing him from attending pre-prom and after-prom events. The case hinged on circumstantial evidence and the timeline of events, as there was no murder weapon or eyewitnesses. Pelley was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 160 years in prison, though the case continues to be appealed, and the crime remains a haunting memory for the surviving family and community.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by masked federal agents while accompanying an immigrant out of immigration court. The Department of Homeland Security stated Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, while Lander's team stated he was taken by masked agents and detained by ICE while escorting a defendant out of immigration court. Video footage shows Lander asking officials for a judicial warrant and holding onto the immigrant's shoulder before being handcuffed. The arrest sparked immediate criticism, with fellow politicians calling it fascism and evidence of ICE agents breaking the law.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is considering the legality of President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities. The Justice Department is seeking to halt a district judge's order that returned control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The legal battle centers on whether the president exceeded his authority under Title 10 by claiming protests against immigration raids constituted a "rebellion." The administration argues courts should not second-guess the president's military judgments, while California officials contend the deployment infringes on the state's sovereign interests.</p>

          <p>With a significant percentage of adults carrying healthcare-related debt, several options exist to alleviate the financial burden. These include negotiating directly with the provider for lower rates or payment plans, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care if income-eligible, and utilizing a medical bill advocate to identify errors and overcharges. Traditional debt relief strategies like debt consolidation and debt management programs can help manage medical debt alongside other debts. Debt settlement is also an option, but should be considered as a last resort due to potential credit score damage and tax implications.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his own Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities, aligning himself with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's warnings of Iran's "imminent" plans to produce nuclear weapons. Gabbard's assessment, consistent with the broader intelligence community, is that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. As the Trump administration appears closer to a strike on Iran, Gabbard has been excluded from key decision-making discussions, raising concerns about the influence of dissenting views within the administration. The US has dispatched additional military assets to the region, increasing options for direct intervention.</p>

          <p>The Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of prosecution for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, led by Tonia Antoniazzi, addresses the small percentage of abortions that occur after 24 weeks due to "desperate circumstances". While this does not change existing laws regarding abortion services within a healthcare setting, it aims to provide care and support rather than criminalization for vulnerable women. Campaigners have welcomed the decision as a landmark moment for women's rights, though some organizations have expressed concerns about the potential implications.</p>

YouTube's main division, excluding YouTube TV, has seen significant growth since 2021, while Netflix remains the leading subscription provider.
