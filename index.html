          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez held their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of celebrity guests like Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates. The lavish, multi-day event sparked some local protests from the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, which cited concerns over over-tourism and rising costs in the city. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and Sánchez, 55, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019. The festivities appeared to proceed without disruption despite the local opposition.</p>

          <p>Authorities have recaptured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago in a major jailbreak. The escape, which involved inmates climbing through a hole behind a toilet, went unnoticed for hours and has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management. With Massey's arrest, only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, remains at large. Over a dozen individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential revival of Tea Party-era fiscal conservatism within the Republican party, driven by opposition to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Original Tea Party figures like Senator Rand Paul are criticizing the bill for not including sufficient spending cuts to offset its proposed tax reductions, echoing the movement's initial focus on fiscal discipline. However, this new wave faces the challenge of opposing a popular Republican president, unlike the original movement which organized against a Democratic administration. The piece questions whether these neo-Tea Partiers will maintain their stance or ultimately concede.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants, effective September 2. The Department of Homeland Security argues that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently since the 2010 earthquake that initially prompted the program. This decision means that affected individuals will lose their legal status and work permits, making them eligible for deportation unless they qualify for other immigration relief. The move contrasts with the U.S. State Department's own travel advisory, which warns Americans against visiting Haiti due to severe instability and violence.</p>

          <p>This article argues that U.S. auto manufacturers are engaging in "economic racism" by failing to adequately invest in marketing to the Hispanic community, despite their growing purchasing power. The author points out that while Hispanics represent a substantial and growing percentage of vehicle buyers, the advertising budgets allocated to Spanish-language media are disproportionately small. The piece contrasts this with more successful engagement with the African American market and names specific companies like Hyundai and GMC for their low spending. It concludes that this neglect is a missed opportunity driven by prejudice within corporate leadership.</p>

This statement comes as the administration has been pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023. A previous 60-day ceasefire proposal was reportedly supported by Israel but met with amendments from Hamas that the U.S. deemed unacceptable. The war has resulted in a significant number of casualties on both sides, with over 56,000 killed in Gaza according to its Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, a tool frequently used to block presidential policies. This ruling is a significant victory for the Trump administration, as it makes it more difficult for opponents to halt the implementation of executive orders across the country. The decision in Trump v. CASA enhances presidential power by requiring challenges to federal policies to be litigated on a more individual or regional basis. The outcome is seen as a major blow to judicial checks on executive authority.</p>

          <p>University of Virginia President James E. Ryan has resigned amid a federal investigation into the school's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The resignation follows pressure from the Trump administration's Justice Department, which accused the university of simply rebranding DEI initiatives rather than eliminating them as per a presidential order. Sources indicate the university feared losing federal funding, including research grants and student financial aid, if it did not comply.

The Nasdaq also set a new record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose but remained below its previous peak.

Key changes include halting new enrollments for undocumented adults in the state's low-income healthcare program and introducing monthly premiums for some recipients. The budget relies heavily on state savings and borrowing to avoid deeper cuts to safety net programs and new taxes. Republicans criticized the plan for not doing enough to curb future spending, while some Democrats opposed the healthcare cuts as a betrayal of immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup offers substantial prize money, with European teams like Manchester City and Chelsea positioned to earn significant sums. A team that wins the tournament could take home approximately £92 million in total, which includes a participation fee and performance-based prize money. The earnings are substantial enough that they can offset the transfer fees for major new player signings. This influx of cash has raised concerns among some, like the European Leagues president, who fear it could distort the financial balance of domestic competitions.</p>

          <p>An error by the Fredericton police has led to the collapse of three separate murder cases, resulting in a stay of proceedings for five accused individuals. The Crown prosecutor did not specify the nature of the "insurmountable evidentiary issue" in court, but the police chief later took full responsibility in a public statement. The error not only impacted the case investigated by Fredericton police but also detrimentally affected a related major crime investigation by a partner agency. Family members of the victims were left devastated and without answers following the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman, who once recommended a low single-digit allocation to cryptocurrency, now suggests that investors could consider holding 10% to 40% of their portfolios in crypto. He attributes this major shift in his thinking to the evolution of the crypto industry, which he now views as a mainstream asset class. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio is becoming obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating assets with higher potential returns. He notes that crypto's lack of correlation with traditional assets makes it a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

In a social media post, Trump called the tax an "egregious" and "blatant attack on our Country," and stated that new tariffs against Canada would be announced within a week. The move abruptly jeopardizes the trade relationship with one of America's largest partners, with U.S. goods trade totaling roughly $762 billion last year.

Justice Clarence Thomas's majority opinion was dismissive of privacy concerns, suggesting adults have no right to keep their viewing habits private from verification systems. This decision reverses decades of precedent and may force courts to subjectively determine the "serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value" of online content.</p>

The government's case relies on testimony from convicted felons who have been protected from deportation in exchange for their cooperation.

Research shows that employees are 15 times more likely to save for retirement when they have access to automatic payroll deductions.

          <p>California lawmakers have voted to more than double the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing the annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as other states and countries lure productions away with more generous incentives. The expansion aims to bring productions back to California and revitalize the local industry, which has been hit hard by strikes and out-of-state competition. Governor Gavin Newsom had called for the expansion to ensure the state remains competitive.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's foreign policy approach through the lens of the recent "12-day war" with Iran. Despite ordering aggressive military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, Trump quickly pivoted to broker a ceasefire, suggesting a continued aversion to prolonged, transformative conflicts like the Iraq War. The author argues that Trump views military force not as a tool for regime change, but as a means to gain leverage for negotiations with existing world leaders. His actions show a pattern of supporting allies like Israel but also publicly pressuring them when their actions conflict with his goal of ending a conflict.</p>
