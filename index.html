        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly set to dismiss Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. This move follows federal prosecutors' inability to find sufficient evidence to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James with mortgage fraud, despite pressure from Trump officials. Sources suggest the administration intends to replace Siebert with a prosecutor who would more aggressively pursue an investigation into James, escalating concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice and its use against political adversaries. The dismissal could create significant turmoil in a key prosecutor's office responsible for major national security cases.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated that the recent price increases for the new iPhone 17 models are not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the new iPhone's launch event, Cook clarified the pricing strategy, even as the company has previously acknowledged financial impacts from the trade policies. To mitigate tariff costs, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, shifting some production from China to countries like India and Vietnam. The company is also navigating challenges related to its AI strategy and increasing competition in global markets.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have issued a warning that Jonathan Carl, a 42-year-old man recently jailed for sexual assault and the reckless transmission of HIV, may have hundreds of additional victims. Carl was sentenced to 17 years after being reported by two men who discovered they had similar predatory experiences with him. Investigators found over 400 digital contacts on gay dating apps and messages indicating other potential victims, prompting a public health effort to contact and screen at least 82 men. The case has raised further concerns about the LGBTQ+ community's trust in the police, especially in East London.</p>

          <p>A vaccine advisory committee, reconstituted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has postponed a vote on whether to delay the routine first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for most newborns. The panel was considering changing the long-standing recommendation from administering the shot within 24 hours of birth to waiting at least one month. The delay came after some members, including known vaccine critics, raised questions about safety, while others defended the current protocol as a highly effective public health measure that has virtually eliminated the disease in children. The current birth-dose recommendation will remain in place pending a future meeting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to face significant legal and practical challenges, according to experts. Legal scholars note that the U.S. government lacks a legal mechanism to label domestic groups as terrorist organizations, partly due to First Amendment concerns about prosecuting an ideology rather than specific criminal acts. Antifa is a decentralized movement without a formal structure or leadership, making a blanket designation difficult to apply. While the administration could prioritize investigations into individuals associated with the movement, a formal designation would be an unprecedented move with uncertain legal authority.</p>

Kashkari's more dovish stance is based on his assessment that inflation expectations remain anchored and that factors like housing inflation and wage growth are easing.

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a supply chain strategy known as "tariff hacking" or the B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the financial burden of U.S. tariffs. This method involves routing online consumer purchases through a third-party middleman, which acts as the official importer or "merchant of record." This intermediary buys the product from the retailer at a wholesale price and pays the tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price, significantly cutting the duty cost. This allows retailers to absorb the impact of the trade war without passing the full cost increase on to consumers.</p>

          <p>Liz Uihlein, a billionaire businesswoman and one of the largest donors to Donald Trump and the Republican party, privately expressed skepticism about the president's trade strategy with China. In an internal company email, Uihlein shared a cartoon depicting Trump claiming to "hold the cards" in negotiations with Xi Jinping, only for Xi to reply, "The cards are made in China." This indicates that even some of Trump's most significant financial backers have harbored private doubts about his hardline trade policies, which have impacted businesses like Uihlein's office supply company, Uline, that import goods from China.</p>

          <p>Several New York lawmakers, including City Comptroller Brad Lander and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, were among dozens arrested during a protest at a federal building in Manhattan. The demonstration was organized to block access for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicles and to demand access to an ICE intake facility amid reports of poor conditions. Protesters condemned the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, including recent arrests made inside the courthouse. The Department of Homeland Security responded by calling the protest a "stunt" and defending the arrests of what it termed "agitators and sanctuary politicians."</p>

          <p>A rare 3,000-year-old golden bracelet belonging to King Amenemope, which recently vanished from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, has been permanently lost. Egyptian authorities revealed that a restoration specialist working at the museum stole the artifact and sold it for approximately $3,800. The bracelet was then passed through several gold dealers before being melted down and reshaped into new jewelry. Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft, but the irreversible destruction of the ancient artifact has caused public outrage and sorrow over the loss of a priceless piece of cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has defended his decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, arguing it is a necessary step to combat Hamas and advance peace. Responding to criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the plan "reckless," Macron stated that Hamas's goal is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a state. He asserted that recognizing Palestine within a broader peace plan is a precondition for isolating the militant group and creating stability in the region. France plans to formalize its decision at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, a move that contrasts with the current U.S. position.</p>

          <p>Annual fees for premium travel credit cards are increasing, with American Express raising its Platinum card fee to $895 and JPMorgan Chase bumping its Sapphire Reserve to $795. In response, card issuers are boosting the value of associated benefits, primarily through statement credits for specific vendors like Lululemon and StubHub. Financial experts advise consumers to conduct a personal analysis to determine if these high fees are worthwhile. Key factors to consider include the value derived from airport lounge access, whether the offered credits align with existing spending habits, and if the cardholder is willing to manage the perks to maximize their value.</p>
