          <p>Police are investigating historical sexual assault allegations against a convicted former bishop and a former vicar of the Church in Wales. Four alleged victims have come forward, detailing how concerns about former Bishop Anthony Pierce, who was jailed earlier this year for child sexual abuse, were reportedly ignored by church officials for decades, even leading to his promotion. This scandal follows recent critical reports highlighting significant safeguarding issues within the Church. The Church in Wales has issued a profound apology, acknowledging past failings, and committed to an external safeguarding audit of all cathedrals and a comprehensive review of its internal culture to ensure a safer environment.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one workers were safely rescued after a partial tunnel collapse at a large industrial complex in Los Angeles. The incident occurred in an 18-foot diameter wastewater management tunnel, approximately five to six miles from the entry point. Despite the collapse, workers managed to scramble over debris to safety, and all were brought out without visible injuries. Los Angeles Fire Department Interim Chief Ronnie Villanueva and Mayor Karen Bass expressed relief, calling it a "great outcome" to a "very scary evening." Over 100 LAFD responders, including specialized search and rescue teams, were deployed to the scene.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily has published an analysis warning about the "moral pitfalls" of humanoid military robots, urging ethical and legal research. The article, citing Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, suggests that militarized humanoids violate the first law against harming humans, necessitating amendments to such guidelines. Authors propose that military robots must adhere to the laws of war by "obeying humans," "respecting humans," and "protecting humans." This highlights an ongoing ethical debate within China's military regarding the future development and deployment of autonomous combat systems.</p>

          <p>A massive overnight Russian drone and missile attack has struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulting in at least two fatalities and 16 injuries. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported the assault involved 18 missiles and approximately 400 drones, primarily targeting the capital. Residential buildings, vehicles, and essential infrastructure were hit, with fires erupting across the city and a primary healthcare center almost completely destroyed. This latest large-scale attack underscores Russia's intensified terror campaign, prompting Zelensky to call for faster sanctions and increased investment in weapons production and air defense from international partners.</p>

          <p>Six Secret Service agents have been suspended without pay following a July 2024 assassination attempt on President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. The agency's deputy director, Matt Quinn, stated the disciplinary actions, ranging from 10 to 42 days of unpaid leave, aim to address the "operational failure" that allowed the gunman to open fire. The incident resulted in one fatality and injuries to two others, including Trump. The Secret Service is now implementing new measures, such as military-grade drones and mobile command posts, to improve security protocols and communication with local law enforcement, emphasizing accountability and preventing future lapses.</p>

          <p>Senior UK government figures are close to finalizing a migrant deal with France, aiming to return at least some English Channel crossers. The proposed "one-in-one-out" pilot scheme would see France take back approximately 50 migrants weekly, with the UK accepting a similar number of asylum seekers with legitimate cases. Critics argue this scale is insufficient to deter crossings, equating to only about 5% of current attempts. The agreement marks a new phase in Franco-British diplomacy on migration, but its ultimate success will hinge on whether it can significantly reduce the number of people attempting dangerous Channel crossings over time.</p>

          <p>China's new curbs on rare earth exports are sparking significant concern within the European Union, intensifying anxieties ahead of an upcoming Beijing summit. EU officials, like MEP Bart Groothuis, view these restrictions as an intentional move by China to exert strategic control over a critical resource, rather than collateral damage from US-China trade disputes. Analysts acknowledge the legitimacy of these concerns, noting that Europe will likely remain dependent on Chinese rare earths for at least another decade. The EU's strategy involves increasing recycling capacity and diversifying imports, but these measures will require considerable time to implement effectively.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has approved the new arrest of former President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges related to his brief imposition of martial law last December. This decision sends Yoon back to a detention center, four months after his previous release, as a special prosecutor claims he poses a risk of destroying evidence. Yoon faces additional charges including obstructing official duties and abuse of power, stemming from his authoritarian push to quash liberal opponents. His lawyers have called the arrest request excessive, but the court's approval signals a potentially extended period of custody for the impeached former leader.</p>

Police stated the 20-year-old mother, Maya Hernández, prioritized her appearance over her children's safety, as the car's air conditioning turned off automatically after an hour. Her one-year-old son, Amillio Gutiérrez, was found foaming at the mouth with a body temperature of 107.2 degrees and was pronounced dead shortly after. Hernández has been charged with felony involuntary manslaughter and two counts of murder, while her older child is now in protective custody.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector, Choi Min-kyung, is set to file civil and criminal charges against leader Kim Jong Un in Seoul, alleging sexual assault and torture during her detention in North Korea. This marks the first time a North Korean-born defector has taken legal action against the regime. Choi, who was forcibly repatriated after fleeing to China, later settled in South Korea and continues to suffer psychological trauma. While previous South Korean court rulings against North Korea have been largely symbolic, human rights groups assisting Choi plan to escalate the case to the United Nations and the International Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that some of the world's poorest countries are paying millions to lobbyists with direct ties to Donald Trump, seeking to offset US foreign aid cuts. Nations like Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen have signed significant lobbying deals, with some states reportedly bartering crucial natural resources, including minerals, for humanitarian or military support. This trend follows Trump's dismantling of USAID, a move experts warn could lead to millions of avoidable deaths.

          <p>Reform UK is gaining significant political momentum, with two former Conservative cabinet ministers recently defecting, including Sir Jake Berry, a former Tory Party chairman. Berry's strong criticism of both Labour and Tory rule underscores the depth of the shift. This trend of high-profile defections, combined with strong poll numbers and recent electoral successes, is prompting Labour to reorient its strategy, focusing more on countering Nigel Farage's party than the traditional Conservatives. Reform's sustained rise indicates a notable reshaping of the contemporary UK political landscape.</p>

          <p>Poland has reinstated spot checks at 52 border crossings with Germany and 13 with Lithuania, responding to Germany's toughened migration policy. This move, introduced by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, has created difficulties for residents on both sides of the German-Polish border, leading to tailbacks and disrupting daily life. Local officials and citizens express frustration, viewing the checks as a "political show" that undermines the "without borders" ethos of the Schengen area.
