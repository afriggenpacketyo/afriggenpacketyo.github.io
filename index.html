          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been in talks with Japanese leaders about Japan's potential to lead in AI, given its strengths in robotics and manufacturing. Huang emphasized the critical role of energy infrastructure in supporting AI growth, suggesting Japan needs to invest in new power generation. Resource-scarce Japan is currently balancing the energy demands of data centers with the challenges of restarting nuclear reactors and increasing fossil fuel imports, and the discussions also touched on Japan potentially investing in a US$44 billion liquefied natural gas project in Alaska.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the U.S. are having a significant impact, with exports plummeting, particularly in March. This move is a response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, putting pressure on American manufacturers reliant on Chinese rare earths. China holds a dominant position in the rare earth supply chain, essential for manufacturing smartphones and military equipment. The decline includes exports of tellurium, tungsten, molybdenum powder, and bismuth products, with some categories ceasing entirely.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has fallen below 140 yen for the first time in seven months after President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. Trump's remarks, made on social media, raised concerns about the central bank's independence, leading to the dollar's decline. Speculation that the U.S. administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance talks also contributed to the pressure on the dollar. At approximately 2:30 p.m. in Tokyo, the U.S. dollar fell to around 139.90 yen.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is presenting central banks worldwide with a complex challenge: whether to devalue their own currencies or not. A flight from the dollar, driven by uncertainty over U.S. policymaking, has led to appreciation in other currencies, especially safe havens like the yen and franc. While a weaker dollar eases debt burdens and lowers inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness. Some analysts believe emerging markets may consider devaluation, but must tread carefully to avoid capital flight and other risks.</p>
