            <p>A judge has denied a motion to enforce an order regarding AP access, stating that White House officials are entitled to a presumption of good faith. The Trump administration continues to take executive actions, including targeting a former official. Focus remains on the legal battle surrounding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant. Several top Cabinet officials are in Paris to discuss ending the Russia-Ukraine war with European counterparts. The administration's actions and international engagements suggest a complex political landscape.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning a military deportation flight under the Alien Enemies Act, leading to legal challenges by the ACLU. Attorneys argue that Venezuelan migrants are at imminent risk of deportation to El Salvador with little due process, claiming they are being designated as members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU has requested a temporary restraining order to ensure 30 days' notice before removals under the AEA. A federal judge in Texas denied the ACLU's request, citing previous government representations that deportations would not occur during litigation.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status amid escalating tensions over federal funding and allegations of insufficient protection for Jewish students. Legal experts note that such a move would be unprecedented and face significant legal challenges, referencing the Bob Jones University case as a potential, though dissimilar, precedent. Harvard maintains there is no legal basis for rescinding its tax-exempt status, arguing it would severely impact its educational mission and financial aid. Congress has previously acted to prevent presidents from using the IRS for political purposes.</p>

The controversial program is intended to end the koalas’ suffering from burns and starvation after a massive bushfire destroyed their food supply. However, some animal welfare advocates say the government's actions are a result of long-term mismanagement of the species and its habitat, including logging and development.</p>

            <p>J.K. Rowling has a long history of transphobic statements and actions, which have caused anger, betrayal, and grief among trans activists, trans people, and allies. Rowling has made her antagonistic position on trans issues clear through tweets, sound bites, actions, and even a 3,600-word blog post. Her transphobia has become so rampant and constant that it’s difficult to build a completely comprehensive timeline of it. In April 2025, the UK supreme court delivered a major ruling that explicitly denied trans women protection from discrimination on the basis of gender, prompted by a lawsuit funded by Rowling.</p>
