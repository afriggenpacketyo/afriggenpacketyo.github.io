          <h2>Japanese Regions Benefit Economically from Anime and Manga Tourism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 22:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Meiji Yasuda Research Institute indicates that foreign tourism to anime and manga-related locations in Japan has significantly boosted local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists visited these sites, contributing to an estimated 54.3 billion yen in related goods purchases, a 53% increase from 2016. The phenomenon, known as "seichi junrei," involves fans visiting places that inspired or were settings for popular works, with the Homangu Kamado Shrine in Fukuoka Prefecture being a prime example. While the trend offers economic benefits, local governments must address overtourism issues by developing multilingual support systems and training local tourism volunteers. The growing popularity of Japanese entertainment content could also help reduce Japan's digital trade deficit. Optimism that this trend will continue to boost local economies is tempered by the need for sustainable tourism management.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal new details about Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. Boelter's wife told investigators they were "preppers" and that her husband had given her a "bailout plan" before the shootings. Boelter is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Investigators found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffman family released a statement expressing their shock and sadness over the politically motivated attack and calling for a return to civility. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of public officials.</p>

          <p>Due to soaring rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, has opened a ramen noodle restaurant and plans to open more to diversify its offerings. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle business due to saturation in the beef bowl market. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, prompting consumers to seek alternatives like frozen udon noodles and yogurt. This shift reflects changing consumer preferences amid rising costs and companies adapting to maintain affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull discovered in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as a Denisovan after previous attempts to extract DNA failed. Researchers successfully extracted DNA from dental calculus, calcified dental plaque, and compared it to previous samples. The findings indicate that the "dragon man" is the first intact Denisovan specimen discovered to date. Denisovans are known to have coexisted with modern-day humans and are closely related to Neanderthals, expanding our understanding of human evolution. The skull was originally hidden from the Japanese army by a Chinese laborer and later donated to a museum.</p>

Suzanne Morphew disappeared on Mother's Day in 2020, and her death was officially declared a homicide. Her remains were found in September 2023, leading to the re-arrest of her husband, Barry Morphew, on first-degree murder charges after initial charges were dismissed. The case has involved bizarre clues, including a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen, but lacked direct evidence for a long time.

          <p>The Trump administration made several decisions that resulted in environmental setbacks across the U.S. The Department of Energy ordered the JH Campbell coal plant in Michigan to remain open, and the administration is expected to extend the life of the Monroe power plant. The plants emit a significant portion of Michigan's greenhouse gas pollution. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of fossil fuel firms in an emissions case. Opponents argue that these decisions lack support, could cost ratepayers, and are ideologically driven.</p>

The experts recommend using soft-bristle toothbrushes, avoiding smoking, and maintaining daily dental hygiene routines. Regular dentist appointments are also crucial for catching dental issues early, with checkup frequency tailored to individual needs.
