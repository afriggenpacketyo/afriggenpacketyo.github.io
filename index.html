          <p>The Ukrainian military issued a rare statement acknowledging that a Russian strike on a military base resulted in the deaths of 12 soldiers. In addition to the fatalities, 60 other soldiers sustained injuries in the attack, marking a significant loss for the Ukrainian forces. This admission of casualties underscores the ongoing intensity and human cost of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The acknowledgment of losses is a departure from typical communications and signals the severity of the situation on the ground. The strike highlights the continued vulnerability of Ukrainian military installations to Russian attacks, illustrating the persistent challenges Ukraine faces in defending its territory. </p>

          <p>More than 20 individuals were killed near an aid distribution site in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials. The circumstances surrounding the attack remain unclear, with conflicting reports on who was responsible. The Israeli military has denied any involvement, stating that its forces did not fire upon the site. This incident adds to the already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where access to essential resources like food and medical supplies is severely limited. The lack of clarity regarding the attack's origin further exacerbates the tension and mistrust in the region, compounding the suffering of civilians caught in the conflict. </p>

          <p>Representative Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), asserts that Democrats are "on offense" in the 2026 battle to regain the House majority from the GOP. DelBene argues that President Donald Trump and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are harming working families. She notes that Democrats only need to win three more seats to reclaim the majority, with 35 districts in play across the country. While the historical trend favors the party out of power in midterm elections, the 2026 map appears to favor Republicans, leading to a strategic and potentially challenging campaign for Democrats. </p>

          <p>Ms. Rachel, a popular children's YouTube personality, has faced backlash from pro-Israel right-wing groups for speaking out about the situation in Gaza. The group StopAntisemitism has requested the Department of Justice investigate whether Ms. Rachel is operating as a foreign agent due to her posts about Gazan children. This controversy arose after Ms. Rachel began a fundraiser for children in Gaza and shared statistics and images highlighting the tragedy in Palestine. The criticism reflects a broader trend of rejecting the vulnerability and innocence of Palestinian children, with Ms. Rachel's advocacy serving as a reminder of their humanity and need for care. The article underscores the contentious nature of discussing the conflict and the risks faced by public figures who speak out on behalf of Palestinians. </p>

          <p>A dual-certified child life specialist and therapist shares six actionable steps parents can take to build trust with their children. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, and modeling behavior rather than interrogating. Making meaningful conversations a part of the daily routine, such as sharing highs and lows at dinner, is also crucial. Teaching coping strategies for managing emotions helps children navigate their feelings effectively. Building trust happens through consistent, small moments of open communication and emotional support. </p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming defence review will signal a strong message to Moscow amid growing concerns about Russian aggression, including daily cyber-attacks on UK military networks. The review will outline plans to deter Russia and other countries like China, committing £1.5 billion to build six new munitions factories to revive Britain's industrial base. This investment will bring UK munitions spending to £6 billion during this parliament, creating 1,800 new jobs. The government plans to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity, procuring long-range weapons like drones and missiles over several years. The review will also recommend a new "cyber and electromagnetic command" to lead defensive and offensive cyber operations. </p>

The U.S. State Department recently announced stricter screening and potential revocation of student visas for Chinese nationals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The speech serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of cross-cultural understanding and collaboration during a period of geopolitical strain. </p>

The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations in low-visibility conditions. </p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts have largely given Nvidia a pass for a recent quarter that was considered confusing and not typical for the company. While Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.81, below estimates of $0.93, it posted a second adjusted EPS figure of $0.96 after excluding the "H20 charge and related tax impact" due to the fall of its China business. Despite the adjusted figures, some argue that Nvidia does not fully deserve the positive reception it received, as the $0.96 figure represents a reality that does not exist. CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that demand for AI chips remains strong, and CFO Colette Kress stated that profit margins will likely return to historically normal levels later this year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched an attack on Russian nuclear-capable long-range bombers at a military base in Siberia, marking the first such attack far from the front lines. Unverified video and pictures on social media showed Russian strategic bombers on fire at the Belaya air base near Irkutsk. A Ukrainian intelligence official stated that the SBU conducted a large drone attack on over 40 Russian military aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22 strategic bombers. The governor of Irkutsk confirmed a drone attack on a military unit near the village of Sredny but did not mention strategic aviation. There was also a Ukrainian drone attack in the Murmansk region of northern Russia, according to local officials. </p>

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies for security-related technology since the Defense Ministry's program began in fiscal 2015. This funding supports research amid budget constraints, especially for universities outside Tokyo. The ministry's program has become an important funding source for researchers as operational subsidies to national universities decline. An expert expressed concern about the potential for military applications, emphasizing the need to consider the risks. The subsidy budget has increased over the years, with universities working on projects such as gas-absorbing sheets and AI systems for detecting cyberattacks. </p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough choices are unavoidable as the government finalizes spending plans. The level of spending on health will determine whether cuts are made to unprotected areas outside the NHS, defence, and schools. While funding increased in 2024, it will no longer increase year on year, given government commitments. The IFS suggests that a huge amount depends on the generosity of cash handed to the NHS, which accounts for 39% of day-to-day departmental spending. Increased defence spending would mean bigger cuts elsewhere. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump faces skepticism from Republican senators, investors, and Elon Musk regarding his ability to address the national debt. Concerns arise over the multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks package and its impact on deficits. Critics argue that Trump has failed to trim deficits as promised, relying on economic growth to solve the problem. Economists doubt Trump's plan can spark enough growth to reduce deficits. The White House maintains that its policies will unleash rapid growth, shrinking deficits relative to the economy. </p>
