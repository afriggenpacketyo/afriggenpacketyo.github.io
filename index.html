          <p>Bill Belichick, the 73-year-old former NFL coach, discusses his new book, "The Art of Winning," which focuses on his life lessons in football rather than boasting about achievements. Belichick shares insights on his coaching philosophy, emphasizing strategic adjustments over inspirational speeches, and expresses his motivation to give back to the sport. He touches on his relationship with Tom Brady and the Patriots, and his recent appointment as head coach of the University of North Carolina after a split with Robert Kraft. The interview also addresses his relationship with Jordon Hudson, his "creative muse."</p>

          <p>Billions of cicadas from Brood XIV are expected to emerge in the eastern United States this spring, primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee. The emergence occurs when the soil reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit, typically in late April or May in warmer states and May or June in cooler states. Cicadas remain above ground for 4 to 6 weeks, making loud buzzing sounds as part of their mating process. These periodical cicadas emerge every 17 years, living underground as larvae and feeding on plant roots between emergences.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have seen the worst stock market performance since the Nixon era, with the S&P 500 dropping 7.9%.

The market downturn is attributed to Trump's aggressive trade policies, raising concerns about inflation and recession.

          <p>The increasing focus on IQ by figures like Donald Trump and those in Silicon Valley is leading to an overvaluation of intelligence as a measure of human worth, while generative AI is rapidly automating white-collar jobs that previously relied on high IQ. This shift could diminish the value of IQ, as AI takes over tasks in finance, tech, and advertising. The dismantling of the Department of Education, fueled by a belief in fixed intelligence, contrasts with the department's original mission of promoting early interventions for brain development.</p>
