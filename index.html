          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 17:46:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has officially accepted an unconditional donation of a luxury jet from Qatar, according to a memorandum of understanding signed by defense officials. The agreement allows the Air Force to retrofit the opulent aircraft for presidential use, with the classified costs reportedly being drawn from a budget intended to replace aging nuclear missiles. Critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, have questioned the wisdom of spending potentially a billion dollars to refurbish a plane that would then be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation after his term. The agreement specifies the jet is a bona fide gift, accepted "as is" without warranties.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident occurred in Miami's Biscayne Bay when a barge collided with a sailboat carrying children from a summer camp. Two children were killed, and two others were left in critical condition after all six occupants of the sailboat were thrown into the water. The Miami Yacht Club, which ran the camp for children aged seven to fifteen, expressed devastation over the event. The U.S. Coast Guard has launched an investigation into the collision near Star Island to determine the cause of the fatal accident.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with bladder cancer and is now considered cancer-free following successful treatment. At a press conference with his medical team, doctors confirmed they removed a high-grade tumor and his bladder, subsequently creating a new one using his intestines. Sanders, who became emotional while discussing his journey, stated he never questioned "God, why me?" and hopes his experience encourages others, particularly African-American men, to get regular health checkups. He confirmed he will continue in his role as head coach for the team.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge rejected a lawsuit from investment fund Azoria Capital that sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its upcoming interest rate meeting to the public. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the federal "Sunshine Act" requiring open meetings. During the hearing, the judge questioned if the lawsuit, filed by a firm whose CEO is an ally of President Trump, was a publicity stunt to generate interest in the new fund. Azoria Capital stated it will continue its case, arguing for transparency and accountability.</p>

This destructive fire ravaged wealthy neighborhoods like Pacific Palisades, where the average pre-fire home value was $3.7 million.

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Her legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement made with Jeffrey Epstein by federal prosecutors in Florida should have protected her from being charged. This legal challenge comes as Maxwell is reportedly in discussions with the Justice Department about potentially cooperating with the government, which could expose new details about Epstein's network. The core of her appeal rests on whether the Florida plea deal was applicable to the New York district where she was tried.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a notable increase after the European Union agreed to a massive $750 billion energy purchase from the United States. Major LNG exporters like Cheniere and Venture Global saw their stocks rise, as did infrastructure firms such as New Fortress Energy. The energy purchase is a key component of a broader trade deal between the U.S. and the EU. EU President Ursula von der Leyen stated the agreement will help diversify Europe's energy supply and reduce its dependence on Russian natural gas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal tax credits for electric vehicles, offering up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, are scheduled to end on September 30. This policy reversal by the Trump administration eliminates a key incentive from the Biden era aimed at promoting cleaner transportation and addressing climate change. Industry analysts and auto dealers anticipate a short-term surge in EV sales as consumers rush to take advantage of the savings before the deadline. The expiration is expected to further slow EV sales, which have already been impacted by plateauing interest and high tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal trade court has declined to block President Trump's decision to eliminate the 'de minimis' tariff exemption for low-value packages, a rule that has benefited Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. The court ruled that the lawsuit, brought by auto parts retailer Detroit Axle, was redundant as the issue is already part of a larger case challenging Trump's tariffs. That broader case is currently pending in an appeals court, keeping the tariffs in place for now. Detroit Axle argued that the sudden removal of the exemption for shipments under $800 poses an "existential threat" to its business model. (not investment advice)</p>

An internal memo revealed that of 1.89 billion data pulls in June, only 13% were directly initiated by customers for transactions, with the rest used for other purposes. The bank, which is preparing to charge these middlemen for data access, also claims that transactions involving aggregators are linked to higher rates of fraud. Plaid countered that the data requests are standard industry practice authorized by customers and are essential for providing critical financial alerts.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirement planning, and its application to annuities. The rule suggests that retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, for at least 30 years. When considering annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. While an annuity may offer a higher payout and longevity protection, it often lacks inflation adjustments and liquidity, making a hybrid strategy of both potentially effective for balancing security and flexibility.
