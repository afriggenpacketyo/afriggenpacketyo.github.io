          <p>Villanova University officials have confirmed that a report of an active shooter at its law school was a malicious hoax. The false alarm, which occurred during a new student orientation mass, prompted a massive law enforcement response and caused widespread panic on the Pennsylvania campus. While no one was injured, the university president described the event as deeply unsettling for the community. Federal and local authorities, including the FBI, are now investigating the incident, known as "swatting," which is a serious crime.</p>

          <p>Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat who has served in Congress since 1995, announced he will not seek another term if a new Republican-drawn congressional map in Texas survives legal challenges. The proposed map reconfigures districts in a way that would likely force Doggett into a contentious primary against fellow progressive Democrat, Representative Greg Casar. Doggett stated he prefers to focus on opposing the Trump administration's agenda rather than engaging in an intra-party battle. The new map is expected to be signed into law, with a court challenge anticipated.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion article argues that the New York appellate court's decision to throw out Judge Arthur Engoron's nearly half-a-billion-dollar penalty against Donald Trump represents a significant rebuke of the judge's handling of the civil fraud case. The author contends that the original fine was absurdly inflated and politically motivated by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who campaigned on pursuing Trump. The article characterizes the trial as "lawfare" and suggests Judge Engoron's actions were unconstitutional and detached from legal or factual reality, ultimately damaging the state's business environment.</p>

          <p>California's legislature has approved a plan to hold a special election in November, asking voters to authorize the redrawing of the state's congressional map. This Democratic-led initiative, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to create up to five new Democratic-leaning U.S. House seats. The move is a direct response to a similar Republican effort in Texas, sought by Donald Trump, to gerrymander maps in their favor. Proponents call it a necessary "fight fire with fire" strategy to protect democracy, while opponents criticize it as a costly and hypocritical power grab.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers salvaged a four-game series split against the Colorado Rockies with a 9-5 victory on Thursday. The Dodgers' offense started strong, with Freddie Freeman hitting a two-run homer in the first inning, and they continued to build their lead throughout the game. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw secured his eighth win, allowing three runs over 5 2/3 innings before being relieved. This win allows the Dodgers to maintain their division lead as they head into a critical weekend series against the second-place San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly $500 million penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, ruling the fine was excessive and likely unconstitutional. While the court upheld the underlying finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it determined the financial penalty was not justified by the harm caused. Non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state, remain in place. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Transportation has painted over a rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that served as a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. Orlando's mayor condemned the removal as a "cruel political act," stating the crosswalk honored the victims while also improving pedestrian safety. Governor Ron DeSantis defended the action on social media, asserting that state roads will not be "commandeered for political purposes." The move is part of a broader state policy prohibiting pavement art with social or political messages on state-maintained roads.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with canceling National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and gender identity. The ruling lifts a lower court's order that had required the NIH to restore funding for over 1,700 grants nationwide. The administration argued the grants did not align with its policy objectives, while a coalition of states and research groups contended the cancellations were unlawful and harmful. The underlying legal challenge against the administration's policy will continue in the lower courts.</p>

This arrest highlights the controversial nature of the UK government's decision to ban Palestine Action, which makes showing support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's market value dropped by nearly $100 million after its stock price fell over 7% on Thursday following the debut of a new, modernized logo. The redesign removes the familiar image of "Uncle Herschel," an overall-clad man leaning on a barrel, which has long been a symbol of the chain's "old country store" identity. The move is part of a broader brand refresh aimed at increasing relevance, but it drew sharp criticism from some conservative commentators and marketing experts who called it a misstep that abandons the company's core brand identity.

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst, known for her roles in independent films and blockbusters alike, recently stated her desire to appear in a sequel to the highly successful "A Minecraft Movie." In an interview, she candidly expressed a wish to "make a pile of cash" and be in a film that is financially lucrative, contrasting with some of her more recent, critically acclaimed but less commercial projects. Dunst, whose career spans nearly four decades, last appeared in the dystopian film "Civil War," which became studio A24's second-highest-grossing film but earned significantly less than the Minecraft adaptation.</p>

          <h2>Market Analysis Suggests Federal Reserve Rate Cuts May Now Favor Cyclical Stocks Over Tech</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent market behavior indicates a shift in how investors are viewing potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with value-oriented cyclical stocks now being favored over high-growth technology names. Traditionally, lower rates boost the valuation of tech stocks with high future earnings potential. However, the current focus appears to be on which companies will see immediate upward earnings revisions from a more dovish Fed, such as home improvement retailers that benefit from lower mortgage rates, rather than secular growth stories like AI that are less sensitive to rate changes.

          <p>Public records reveal that protests targeting hotels where federal immigration agents were staying during raids in Los Angeles successfully disrupted the operations. Emails from the U.S. Marines show that military officials compiled a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid" due to "harassment of ICE and CBP personnel" by demonstrators. Activists had staged "No sleep for ICE" rallies outside the hotels to pressure them to evict the agents. The documents suggest the community-led protests were an effective strategy in hindering the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the city.</p>
