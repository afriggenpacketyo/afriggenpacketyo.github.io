          <h2>Trump Orders Removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook Citing Mortgage Fraud Allegations</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the immediate firing of Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud stemming from a referral by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, has firmly stated her refusal to resign, asserting that Trump lacks the legal authority to remove her "for cause" under federal law, a power typically reserved for malfeasance. This dramatic action escalates Trump's ongoing criticism of the central bank's interest rate policies, which he blames for hindering economic growth. The move is expected to face a significant legal challenge, testing the limits of presidential power over the Federal Reserve's traditionally independent governance, with the Supreme Court having previously noted the Fed's unique quasi-private status.</p>

          <p>A report by the Tech Transparency Project alleges that Meta has strategically utilized its financial relationship with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) to enhance its public image regarding child safety. The report claims Meta's sponsorship helps lend "expert approval" to its platforms, aiming to counter growing concerns about their detrimental impact on teens' well-being. Critics, including a mother whose son died by suicide after a sextortion scheme on Meta's Messenger, accuse the National PTA of accepting "blood money" from social media companies deemed harmful. Both Meta and the National PTA defend their collaboration, asserting it serves to inform families about available safety tools and resources while providing a strong voice for parents and children.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the 37-year-old director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), is identified as the obscure Trump official behind the mortgage fraud allegations used as a pretext to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Pulte has a history of using his position to scrutinize mortgage records of Trump's Democratic opponents, including Sen. Adam Schiff and NY Attorney General Letitia James, recommending their prosecution. He has also publicly pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell and sought pretexts for his removal. This article highlights Pulte's controversial "attack dog" role, leveraging his social media following and political donations to advance Trump's agenda against perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has sharply criticized John Bolton, labeling him "Doctor Strangelove with a mustache" and accusing him of "profiteering off America’s secrets." Navarro's comments follow an FBI raid on Bolton's home last week in a reported classified document probe, linked to his 2020 memoir, "The Room Where it Happened." Navarro alleges Bolton disclosed confidential national security information and Oval Office conversations, potentially violating U.S. code and executive privilege. This article highlights the intense political infighting and legal scrutiny surrounding former administration officials and their handling of sensitive government information, with Navarro suggesting Bolton could face prison.</p>

Meghan shares details about her family routines, including making breakfast for her children, and recounts that Prince Harry first expressed "I love you" during their third date. The article notes the series avoids any mention of the Royal Family rift or their former lives as working royals, focusing instead on aspirational lifestyle content.

          <p>The families of Justyna Czoska and Wojtek Kowalkowski are expressing profound heartbreak and struggling to cope after a fatal helicopter crash near Shanklin on the Isle of Wight. The incident claimed three lives, including the couple from Oxfordshire, and left another person in serious condition. The aircraft, a Robinson R44 II, was reportedly on a flying lesson with four individuals aboard when it tragically came down. A fundraiser has been initiated to support the families and facilitate the repatriation of the couple's remains to Poland. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has launched an investigation into the crash, which is expected to take approximately 12 months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of homeowners are opting to withdraw their properties from the market rather than reduce asking prices, signaling widespread frustration with prolonged sales periods. A recent Realtor.com report indicates that delistings, or homes taken off the market unsold, have surged by 38% since early 2025 and 48% from a year ago. This trend suggests a potential deadlock in the housing market, as the reluctance of sellers to lower prices clashes with buyer hesitancy due to steep prices and high mortgage rates. Many homeowners, often locked into favorable existing mortgage rates, are choosing to wait for improved market conditions rather than compromise on their desired sale price.</p>

          <p>Analysts interpret President Donald Trump's revived threat of a 200% tariff increase on China's rare earth elements as a clear confirmation of these minerals' critical role in global manufacturing. This aggressive stance underscores Beijing's significant dominance in the rare earth sector, which remains a potent source of leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. The threat is largely viewed as an "off-the-cuff warning" intended for scenarios where trade talks might break down and these crucial shipments could be halted again.

Progressives are now finding success by combining "profane style and policy substance" online.

He eventually encounters a pair of mysterious twins, Peter and June, who draw him into their unusual games and rituals in the woods.

          <p>Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) continues to face a cultural backlash, despite its immense popularity as the chain's top-selling seasonal beverage. This article explains that the contempt for the PSL often transcends its flavor, stemming instead from anxieties about capitalism, "seasonal creep," and sexism, as the drink is frequently coded as "basic" and feminine. The article traces the PSL's history since its 2003 launch, its formula change to include real pumpkin, and its rise as a social media phenomenon. Ultimately, it suggests that the intense "hot take" era for PSLs may be waning, allowing the drink to return to its simple autumnal significance.</p>

Marketing experts widely criticized the new design as generic and a departure from the company's established "brand story."

          <p>An international project has uncovered a well-preserved Stone Age settlement, lost to rising sea levels 8,500 years ago, beneath the Bay of Aarhus in Denmark. Divers retrieved animal bones, stone tools, and a piece of worked wood from the site, which offers a unique "time capsule" into coastal Mesolithic life. Researchers are using dendrochronology to precisely date submerged trees, mapping the rapid sea level rise of 6.5 feet per century during that era. This discovery provides valuable insights into how ancient societies adapted to significant environmental changes, a relevant lesson as today's world faces climate-driven sea level increases.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker forcefully responded to Donald Trump's comments mocking his weight, stating, "It takes one to know one," and criticizing Trump's own physical condition. This exchange occurred amidst escalating tensions over Trump's consideration of unilaterally deploying the National Guard to Chicago, a move Pritzker and other local leaders oppose as unnecessary overreach. Pritzker accused Trump of "living in fifth grade" and using personal attacks as a projection of his own insecurities. The article highlights the contentious political climate and the use of personal insults in high-stakes policy debates.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent US-EU "Framework on an Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade" represents Europe's capitulation to Washington's China containment strategy. The article asserts that Brussels has traded sovereignty for subordination, agreeing to enforce US export controls and implement "economic security alignment" measures to restrict capital and technology flows to China. This realignment, codified through clauses like Article 19, effectively eliminates the transatlantic divisions Beijing once exploited. The author concludes that the EU is now cast as an auxiliary enforcer of America's China policy. (not investment advice)</p>
