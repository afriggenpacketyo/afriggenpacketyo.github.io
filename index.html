          <p>President Donald Trump expressed uncertainty regarding whether people in the U.S. are entitled to due process rights, which are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Trump's administration is pushing aggressively to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and other non-citizens. Trump said he did not know about the due process rights, and that such a requirement would mean “we'd have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials.” Optimism Score: 30</p>
