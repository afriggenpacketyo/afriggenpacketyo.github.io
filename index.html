            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among American consumers and businesses. Initially, tariffs were announced on a wide range of imports, leading to concerns about price increases and potential shortages. While some items like smartphones were later exempted, the overall impact is expected to raise costs for families and disrupt supply chains. The uncertainty has prompted some consumers to stock up on goods, while others feel paralyzed by the constant changes. (not investment advice)</p>

While this provides relief for the tech industry, these goods are still subject to fentanyl-related tariffs.</p>
