        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have reached a preliminary agreement to ease tariffs for 90 days, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war. The agreement was announced following weekend talks in Geneva, where both sides expressed optimism about addressing their economic and trade concerns. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs, with the US lowering tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, and China reducing import duties on American goods from 125% to 10%. This pause aims to provide room for further negotiations and prevent further economic downturn.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to use executive powers to significantly cut prescription drug prices in America, aiming for reductions between 30% and 80% to align them with prices in other countries. Trump stated that the U.S. would adopt a "most favored nation" policy, paying the lowest price paid by any nation worldwide. This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks as investors worried about potential profit declines. Trump previously targeted high drug costs during his first administration, but those efforts faced legal challenges from pharmaceutical companies, but he believes this time will be different.</p>

          <p>Suffolk County in New York has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a Class A misdemeanor for convicted animal abusers to own pets. The law, an expansion of the county's existing animal abuse registry, carries penalties of up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine. County Executive Ed Romaine emphasized that the county will aggressively prosecute animal abusers to protect animals. The law was enacted shortly after dozens of dead cats were discovered in a Long Island home, highlighting the need for stricter enforcement.</p>

While the course setup is expected to be tougher than usual, McIlroy's familiarity and confidence at Quail Hollow position him as a strong contender. A victory would put McIlroy alongside Sir Nick Faldo's six majors, tying the record for any European in the modern era.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has raised $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a financial app designed for immigrant communities in the U.K. The app supports traditional money-saving methods like "money circles" or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs). Bloom Money aims to provide a digital platform for these informal savings systems, addressing issues such as a lack of regulation and discrimination within the traditional financial system. Mohanty emphasizes the app's focus on building wealth within immigrant communities rather than solely on remittances.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced that it will release Edan Alexander, a US-Israeli hostage, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Alexander, a 20-year-old soldier, was captured during the October 7, 2023, attack. The release is intended to facilitate a deal for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the release was made possible because of military pressure on Hamas and that preparations to intensify fighting were still continuing.</p>

          <p>Top military officials from India and Pakistan are due to speak on Monday to discuss finer details of the ceasefire agreed between them over the weekend. India announced on Monday that it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns. After the ceasefire, however, both the rivals have declared military victory. The recent hostilities threatened to turn into a full-fledged war as both countries appeared unwilling to back down for days.</p>

Sixty years ago, on May 12, 1965, Germany and Israel established diplomatic relations after a long period of preparation. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is coming to Berlin to mark the anniversary. The visit takes place during the first days of the new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the conservative Christian Democrats(CDU).</p>

          <p>The report that Donald Trump‚Äôs administration is preparing to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family has set off a storm of criticism, as ethics experts say such a gift would violate rules within the constitution that seek to guard against bribery and corruption. Under US law, foreign gifts valued at less than $480 can be retained by federal employees. Anything over that amount is considered a gift to the ‚Äúpeople of the United States‚Äù and must be logged and then disposed of by the White House Gift Unit.</p>

It hasn't stopped him from running for mayor of his southern Davao city stronghold. Under Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges, including those in detention, can run for office unless they have been convicted and have exhausted all appeals.</p>

          <p>House Republicans released a plan late on Sunday that would cause millions of poor Americans to lose Medicaid health coverage and millions more to pay higher fees when they go to the doctor, but that stopped short of an overhaul that would make the deepest cuts to the program. The proposal, which is one piece of a sweeping bill to enact President Trump‚Äôs domestic agenda, including large tax cuts and increased military spending, omits the structural changes to Medicaid that ultraconservative Republicans have demanded. The legislation released on Sunday tries to split the difference between Republicans agitating for deep cuts to Medicaid and those eager to protect their states from changes that could force them to shoulder much higher costs.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are "very excited" at the prospect of bringing back elk to the East Midlands - and to the UK - for the first time in about 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured ¬£15,000 of funding from the Rewilding Britain charity to begin feasibility studies into their return. The animals are regarded as "keystone" species which can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species. Janice Bradley, from Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust (NWT), said one of the major challenges was getting the public used to the idea that elk "should be here".</p>
