          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant drop after the House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits, impacting residential solar installers like Sunrun, which plummeted by over 35% as the legislation ends tax credits for installers that lease equipment. Enphase and SolarEdge also saw declines due to anticipated lower demand for rooftop solar inverters. The bill ends investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities starting construction after a certain period, negatively affecting utility-scale solar projects. However, First Solar's manufacturing tax credit remained relatively unscathed, offering some positive news for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

The Red Crescent emphasizes that the limited aid shipments are insufficient, with reports indicating a rise in starvation-related deaths, including children and the elderly.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is set to halt the production of pennies, with the last batch of blanks already ordered, due to the rising cost of minting the coin. This move, prompted by President Trump's efforts to reduce unnecessary spending, is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually. The Treasury Department estimates that producing a penny now costs 3.69 cents, leading to businesses rounding prices to the nearest nickel. The halt in production will save $56 million in material costs, and the remaining savings will come from facility usage and efficiencies.</p>

Adams asserted that hospitals in New York City suffered disproportionately due to Cuomo's feud with the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, at the time. The Cuomo campaign responded, highlighting the administration's live dashboard that tracked hospital capacity and allowed for patient transfers. Adams's campaign hopes to siphon Black primary voters away from Cuomo, emphasizing his failure to deliver for Black New Yorkers during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move opposed by Democrats and environmental groups. The waivers allowed California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials have vowed to challenge the Senate vote, potentially leading to a legal battle. Sixteen additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards, amplifying the impact of this decision.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, falling to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This decline is attributed to a decrease in people coming to work and study, influenced by changes introduced by the previous Conservative government. There was a significant reduction in dependents accompanying those arriving on work and study visas. The previous largest drop occurred during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Home Office also reported a decrease in asylum seekers housed in hotels, although the numbers remain higher than when Labour came to power last year.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the "Golden Dome for America," a multilayered missile defense system intended to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. The system would include space-based sensors and interceptors, costing potentially hundreds of billions of dollars. The plan aims to detect and destroy missiles ahead of launch, intercept them during flight, and stop them in the final moments before reaching a target. China has criticized the plan as a threat to militarize space and fuel an arms race. The project is still in the conceptual stage, with no funding yet allocated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly cut funding for STEM education research at the National Science Foundation, terminating over 50% of the grants since April. These cuts disproportionately affect programs aimed at improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics training for students from preschool to university. Experts view the grant cancellations as part of a broader attack on education and diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.). The administration has also begun reviewing current awards containing D.E.I. related buzzwords.</p>

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is also exploring whether chemical castration could be made mandatory. The plans come as an Independent Sentencing Review recommended the pilot continue. Chemical castration, delivered through drugs alongside psychiatric work, is targeted at sexual assault offenders with compulsive thoughts about sex. An expert welcomed the extension but doubted the mandatory element would succeed.</p>

The bill would require Medicaid recipients to provide proof of employment, volunteering, or school attendance to receive health insurance. Experts predict this strict version of the requirement could leave millions uninsured, as many eligible individuals may struggle to meet the paperwork standards. While supporters claim the policy combats waste and encourages contribution to society, critics argue it is designed to cut costs by removing eligible individuals from the program.</p>
