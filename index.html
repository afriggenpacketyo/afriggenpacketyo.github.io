          <p>A sniper opened fire on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, killing two detainees and critically injuring a third before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The attack, which involved the gunman firing from a nearby rooftop, is being investigated by the FBI as an act of targeted violence. Evidence found at the scene, including messages on ammunition casings, indicates an anti-ICE motive, prompting officials to condemn the increasingly hostile rhetoric against the agency. This incident follows other recent security threats and attacks on ICE facilities in Texas.</p>

          <p>The operators of Camp Mystic, a private Christian girls' camp in Texas, have announced plans to reopen one year after a devastating flash flood killed 27 campers and counselors. The decision has been met with controversy, particularly from victims' families who criticize the camp's safety measures and lack of communication. The camp will operate at a sister site undamaged by the flood and plans to build a memorial for the victims. However, some parents oppose the reopening, citing unresolved safety concerns and the ongoing search for one missing child's body in the same river.</p>

          <p>The family of a victim from the January mid-air collision between an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against multiple government and corporate entities. The crash, which killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft, was the deadliest in the U.S. since 2001. The lawsuit alleges negligence on the part of the FAA, the Army, American Airlines, and its regional partner PSA Airlines, citing a pattern of near misses and inadequate safety protocols. An NTSB investigation has already highlighted numerous contributing factors, including overworked air traffic controllers.</p>

The activists stated they heard explosions and that objects were dropped on at least ten boats, causing damage but no casualties. The incident has drawn condemnation from Italy and calls for an investigation from the UN, while Israel has not commented on the attack. The flotilla aims to break the long-standing Israeli blockade of Gaza, a mission that organizers intend to continue despite the intimidation tactics.</p>

          <p>Honda has confirmed it is ending the production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which was being assembled by General Motors at a plant in Tennessee. The decision was attributed to evolving market conditions and a desire to align its product portfolio with customer needs and long-term strategy. While the ZDX is being discontinued, production of the Honda Prologue, another EV built in partnership with GM, will continue in Mexico. GM stated the move does not reflect on the workforce or its relationship with Honda, but rather on aligning EV production with slower-than-expected consumer demand.</p>

          <p>In a speech at the United Nations, former President Donald Trump made several unsubstantiated claims regarding the United Kingdom, including an assertion that London is moving toward Sharia law under its current mayor. This claim, long debunked, echoes right-wing memes and ignores the advisory, non-binding role of existing Sharia councils in the UK. Trump also criticized the UK's energy policy, stating that high taxes on North Sea oil have deterred development, despite the fact that windfall taxes were implemented on bumper profits following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He suggested vast, unfound oil reserves remain, contrary to official projections.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has ordered an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments following a BBC investigation. The report found that some individuals were being taken on long-distance journeys, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment allegedly costing the Home Office £600. Critics from across the political spectrum have condemned the practice as a wasteful use of taxpayer money. The investigation also highlighted poor living conditions and exploitation within the for-profit asylum accommodation system, which the government aims to phase out.</p>

          <p>Protests in India's northern Ladakh region turned deadly, with officials reporting at least four fatalities and dozens of injuries following clashes between demonstrators and police. The unrest was sparked by demands for greater autonomy, statehood, and job quotas for local residents in the Himalayan territory. The demonstrations were held in solidarity with activist Sonam Wangchuk, who has been on a hunger strike. Authorities imposed restrictions on public gatherings after a political party office was attacked and a police vehicle was set on fire. The region has been under direct administration from New Delhi since 2019.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, though the change is minimal. For a 10-year loan, the current monthly payment is approximately $989, while a 15-year term costs around $779 per month. These figures are only a few dollars cheaper than they were before the rate cut and earlier in the year. While any reduction in cost is beneficial, the minor change suggests that homeowners should carefully weigh their options and compare rates with other borrowing products before leveraging their home's equity.

          <p>Doctors and public health officials are pushing back against President Trump's suggestion that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen and "tough it out" when experiencing fevers or pain. Medical experts warn that untreated high fevers during pregnancy can be dangerous, potentially causing developmental issues in the baby. They emphasize that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, remains the safest over-the-counter pain and fever reducer for pregnant women. The FDA has also been more cautious, recommending that clinicians consider minimizing its use for routine low-grade fevers, but not forgoing it when medically necessary.</p>

          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has apologized to supporters for the "confusion" and public infighting that has marked the launch of his new left-wing political party, currently named Your Party. The apology follows a bitter public dispute with fellow MP Zarah Sultana over the unauthorized launch of a membership portal, which led to accusations of a "sexist boys' club" from Sultana. Corbyn announced that an official membership system is now open and confirmed the party's founding conference will proceed in November. The rocky start has overshadowed the new venture despite attracting significant initial interest from potential supporters.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's state superintendent, Ryan Walters, has announced a plan to establish chapters of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA in every high school across the state. The move is framed as a way to counter what Walters calls "woke indoctrination" from "radical leftist teachers unions." This government-led promotion of the group, founded by the late activist Charlie Kirk, is the first of its kind in the nation. Walters has threatened to challenge the accreditation of any school district that refuses to allow a chapter, stating that rejecting a club for civic engagement would put the district at risk.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that the drone hit the Red Sea coastal town after attempts to intercept it failed. While the Houthi rebel group in Yemen has not officially claimed responsibility, they have frequently launched similar attacks toward Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians. This attack represents one of the most serious in terms of casualties launched by the group against an Israeli city.</p>

          <p>A new vaccine advisory panel appointed by the Trump administration has issued recommendations that weaken long-standing U.S. policies on COVID-19 shots and childhood immunizations. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) advised that COVID shots be based on "shared clinical decision-making" rather than a universal recommendation. The panel also voted against a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (MMRV) for young children and postponed a vote on the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Health experts worry these changes could create confusion and bureaucratic hurdles, potentially disincentivizing vaccination and complicating access for patients in some states.</p>

          <p>The UK government has further delayed its announcement on plans for the Northern Powerhouse Rail project, a high-speed line intended to connect cities across the north of England. An announcement on the key Liverpool-to-Manchester segment had been anticipated at the upcoming Labour Party conference but has been pushed back due to concerns over long-term costs. According to insiders, the project is undergoing an extended review to avoid the costly mistakes and delays that have plagued the HS2 rail line. The repeated delays have caused frustration among northern mayors who see the project as vital for regional economic growth.</p>

The article suggests proactive strategies for those struggling with debt, such as consolidation, debt management plans, and communicating with lenders.

          <p>A featured essay in The Atlantic argues that the United States is currently living in an authoritarian state, characterized by the erosion of democratic institutions rather than a sudden collapse. The author describes a "zombie democracy" where elections are held but are not truly fair, the judiciary serves political ends, and the legislature acts as a rubber stamp for the executive. This modern authoritarianism thrives on polarization, public passivity, and the spread of misinformation, hollowing out civil society. The article contends that every feature of this model now exists in the U.S., urging citizens to resist the temptation to withdraw and to actively defend democratic values.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers on the Texas coast have been surprised by the appearance of multiple rare and massive "pink meanie" jellyfish washing ashore. This species, scientifically known as Drymonema larsoni, was only identified in 2011 and can grow to have tentacles up to 70 feet long. Known for their distinct color, these jellyfish primarily prey on the much smaller and more common moon jellyfish, following their blooms in warm waters. According to a researcher at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, more than ten have been spotted recently. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be relatively mild.</p>

          <p>In a podcast discussion, historian Geoffrey Kabaservice explores the parallels and differences between the political violence and polarization of the 1960s and the current era in the United States. While the 1960s saw a higher absolute toll of violence, including riots and assassinations, it began from a period of great hope, whereas today's tensions feel like a continuation of a long cycle of radicalization. A key difference highlighted is the role of government; leaders in the 60s often spoke of unity, while the current administration seems to use public anger as a resource for power, actively inflaming divisions.</p>

These boundaries represent safe operating limits for humanity, and exceeding them puts life-support systems at risk. The report gives a "Code Red" status to the biosphere, noting that species extinction and ecosystem loss are far beyond the safe zone. Other severely breached boundaries include the disruption of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and the overload of novel substances like microplastics, indicating a planet in systemic distress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas is intended to encourage companies to hire American workers, but economists offer mixed predictions on its effects. Some believe it could boost domestic hiring in the short term, particularly in the tech industry, by making foreign labor significantly more expensive. However, other research suggests that restricting access to skilled immigrant workers, who often fill specialized roles, could stifle innovation and long-term economic growth. Critics of the policy argue that H-1B workers help firms expand, ultimately creating more jobs for native-born Americans in other roles like management and sales.</p>
