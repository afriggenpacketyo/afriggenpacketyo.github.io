          <p>The foreign ministers of 25 countries, including the UK, Canada, and Japan, have released a joint statement demanding an immediate cessation of the war in Gaza. The declaration accuses Israel of creating a dangerous aid delivery model that fuels instability and fails to provide sufficient humanitarian assistance, a violation of international law. The statement also condemns Hamas for the continued detention of hostages and calls for their unconditional release, emphasizing that a negotiated ceasefire is the best path forward. Israel rejected the statement, asserting it sends the wrong message to Hamas, whom it holds solely responsible for prolonging the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Director of National Intelligence has announced the release of 230,000 previously sealed government files concerning the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The documents, now available through the National Archives, include details of the FBI's investigation, internal memos, and information regarding potential plots. In response, Dr. King's family urged the public to view the files within the historical context of the FBI's extensive surveillance and disinformation campaigns against him and the Civil Rights Movement. The family stated they will review the documents to see if they offer new insights beyond what they have already accepted about the assassination.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:46:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Germany has allowed two envoys from Afghanistan's Taliban regime to enter the country to provide consular services, primarily to facilitate the deportation of Afghan migrants with criminal convictions or failed asylum claims. This move follows a recent deportation flight and marks the first time Taliban representatives have been permitted since they seized power in 2021. Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed that this does not constitute formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban government, which remains unrecognized due to its human rights record. The decision has drawn criticism from the United Nations, which advises against returning people to Afghanistan due to ongoing human rights violations.</p>

          <p>Former White House official Stephen Miller asserted that the alleged use of an autopen by former President Joe Biden was instrumental in implementing immigration policies that allowed a "sadistic criminal underclass" into the United States. The comments were made in response to a DHS report about a suspect in the shooting of a CBP officer who had entered the country illegally. This criticism is part of a broader scrutiny of Biden's presidency, with claims that his reliance on the autopen for signing executive orders and pardons indicates a lack of direct control. The White House supports Miller's claims, stating Biden's entire presidency was effectively run via autopen.</p>

          <p>In the current volatile rate environment, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offering unusually high interest rates, making them an attractive option for parking significant sums of cash. However, savers should consider several factors before committing funds. While a short-term CD can provide protection against market fluctuations and offer a fixed return, longer-term CDs may yield more interest over their full term despite having a slightly lower rate. Furthermore, the most competitive CD rates are typically found at online banks, which may require savers to move money away from their traditional, local banking institutions.

The piece contends that the very term "criminal alien" is misleading, as most are designated as such for violating immigration laws, not for committing other serious offenses.

The sessions cater to a growing demographic of people who identify as spiritual but not religious, offering a sense of connection without formal doctrine.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that there will not be a vote on a resolution calling for the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein before Congress begins its August recess. The non-binding resolution was introduced by House Republicans following a Justice Department review that concluded Epstein had no "client list" and died by suicide. Johnson argued that the administration should be given space to handle the matter and that congressional action is not yet necessary. This decision stalls one of several efforts to make the files public, including a separate bipartisan measure led by Rep. Thomas Massie to compel their release.</p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) holds a substantial financial advantage over its Democratic counterpart, ending the first half of 2025 with $80.7 million in cash on hand compared to the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) $15.2 million. This $65.6 million gap is significantly wider than at the same point before the 2018 midterms. The RNC credits its strong fundraising to working closely with President Trump's team. The DNC, under new leadership and working to recover from 2024 election losses, is facing intraparty tensions but has noted its grassroots fundraising has improved. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's trade policies and the threat of tariffs are disproportionately harming smaller, secondary U.S. ports as shippers reroute cargo to larger hubs like Los Angeles to meet deadlines. Ports in Oakland, Jacksonville, and New Orleans have seen significant decreases in container traffic, leading to concerns about local jobs and economic stability. For example, the Port of Oakland reported a 13% year-over-year decline in container volume. While larger ports are seeing a temporary bump, the overall trend reflects a market recalibration driven by trade uncertainty, with long-term negative consequences expected for the logistics industry.

          <p>For Americans struggling with high credit card debt, a debt management program can be a viable solution, but enrollment is not automatic. To qualify, individuals typically need to meet three main requirements. First, they must have a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new consolidated monthly payment. Second, the debt must be primarily unsecured, like credit cards or personal loans, and fall within the program's limits. Finally, applicants must commit to the program's rules, which usually include closing the enrolled credit accounts and participating in financial counseling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Pedro Hernandez, who was convicted in 2017 for the infamous 1979 murder of six-year-old Etan Patz in New York City, must be given a new trial or be released. The court found that the trial judge gave the jury improper instructions regarding Hernandez's confession, which was obtained after hours of questioning and without initial Miranda warnings. Hernandez has a documented history of mental illness and a low IQ. The decision hinges on the judge incorrectly telling jurors they could not disregard subsequent confessions even if they found the first one was involuntary.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump, in his second term, has escalated his campaign against the press from rhetoric to a multi-pronged assault using the full power of the government. The author details actions such as defunding public broadcasting, filing multi-billion dollar lawsuits against news organizations, and appointing a loyalist to head the FCC who has launched investigations into mainstream broadcasters. The piece contends that these actions, combined with corporate media's apparent timidity and public indifference, represent a "slow-motion demolition of the Fourth Estate."

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, shared his top tips for surviving an encounter with a shark. He advises to first stay calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract the shark's attention. Second, he recommends maintaining eye contact and standing your ground, as sharks prefer to ambush prey from behind and are less likely to attack if they know they are being watched. As a final resort, de Gelder suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to drive it away, rather than punching it.</p>
