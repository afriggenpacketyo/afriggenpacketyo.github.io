          <p>The Taliban government has officially rejected former U.S. President Donald Trump's recent suggestion that he could retake Bagram Air Base. A Taliban spokesman emphasized Afghanistan's sovereignty and urged the United States to adhere to the Doha Agreement, which prohibits threats against the country's territorial integrity. This statement comes four years after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal that left the strategic military facility under Taliban control. The rejection counters Trump's hints that the Taliban might be open to a U.S. military return amid their ongoing economic and political struggles.</p>

          <p>At the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, British athletes Georgia Hunter Bell and Keely Hodgkinson won silver and bronze medals, respectively, in the women's 800m final. Kenya's Lilian Odira secured the gold with a championship record time, narrowly preventing a British one-two finish. For Hunter Bell, the silver medal marks a significant achievement in her return to the sport after a five-year hiatus, upgrading her previous Olympic bronze. Hodgkinson's bronze is also a remarkable accomplishment, as her season was heavily impacted by injury setbacks before her Olympic triumph.</p>

          <p>A recent multibillion-dollar tech agreement between the UK and US, championed by the Labour party, is facing scrutiny for its potential negative consequences. The deal encourages the construction of numerous energy-intensive datacenters to support the growth of artificial intelligence, which critics argue conflicts with the UK's net-zero climate goals due to massive electricity and water consumption. Beyond the environmental impact, concerns are being raised about the societal costs, including the potential erosion of cognitive skills in students and the mental health impacts of AI chatbots, prompting calls for a more deliberate approach.</p>

His agent confirmed he died peacefully in a hospital after a battle with Parkinson's disease, which was complicated by pneumonia. Stapleton's extensive career began in newspapers and spanned decades, including reporting from conflict zones for 'Panorama' and 'Newsnight' before becoming a household name in consumer advocacy and morning television.

          <p>An executive order signed by President Donald Trump to add a $100,000 fee for new H-1B skilled worker visas caused widespread confusion and panic among current visa holders abroad. Many, like one software professional from India, spent thousands of dollars on last-minute flights to return to the U.S. before the order took effect, fearing they would be locked out. The White House later clarified that the one-time fee would only apply to new applicants and not current visa holders, but the initial announcement created significant distress for those who have built their lives and careers in the United States.</p>

The service was marked by heavy security, designated a Level 1 Special Event by Homeland Security. The gathering served as both a moment of mourning for Kirk's supporters and a powerful display of political resolve within the conservative movement.</p>

The algae blooms, fueled by increased nutrient runoff, pose a threat to the bay's seagrass beds, which are crucial for carbon capture and as a food source for thousands of migratory birds. Researchers from the EU-funded Life Wader project are pioneering safe removal techniques and monitoring the environmental impact. The project is also exploring sustainable uses for the harvested algae, such as converting it into fertilizer, dyes, or for energy production.</p>

          <p>Recent partisan redistricting efforts in states like Texas and California assume the 2026 midterm elections will be decided by a razor-thin margin, but historical trends and other factors suggest a more complex picture. While the party not holding the presidency typically gains a significant number of House seats, the current political landscape has fewer vulnerable Republican-held districts compared to past cycles. Analysts suggest that factors like President Trump's approval rating, the state of the economy, and voter enthusiasm will likely be more decisive in determining control of the House than the redrawing of congressional maps alone.</p>

          <p>The assassination of 31-year-old conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a fierce national conversation about political violence and free speech in the United States. Kirk, a prominent leader in the MAGA movement and founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot while speaking at a university event in Utah. His death has prompted Republican leaders to blame 'far-left' rhetoric for fostering a culture of violence, a claim Democrats reject by pointing to a broader pattern of politically motivated attacks.

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a covert, Russian-funded network attempting to interfere in Moldova's upcoming parliamentary elections. An undercover reporter infiltrated the operation, which paid participants to post pro-Russian propaganda and fake news aimed at discrediting the country's pro-EU government. The network, linked to fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, also conducted illegal polls and secretly recorded opposition supporters to create a pretext for questioning the election's legitimacy. The findings reveal a sophisticated disinformation campaign designed to destabilize the strategically significant Eastern European nation and undermine its democratic process.</p>

          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in a septic tank in Nanyuki, Kenya, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national in connection with her murder. Wanjiru was last seen leaving a hotel bar with British soldiers in March 2012. Her friends, who were with her that night, recount the events leading to her disappearance and express their belief that multiple soldiers were involved or aware of the crime. The case has drawn renewed attention, prompting the UK Defence Secretary to meet with Wanjiru's family and pledge support in their pursuit of justice.</p>

          <p>A surge in the popularity of micro-dramas in China has created an unexpected new use for the country's many stalled real estate projects. Lavish sales halls and unfinished luxury apartments are being rented out as film sets for these short, online series, which often feature opulent settings. This trend provides a new revenue stream for developers struggling with cash flow shortages amid a property market downturn. With an audience of over 660 million, the micro-drama industry's demand for high-end locations has turned these symbols of economic slowdown into backdrops for on-screen stories of wealth and romance.</p>
