          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick voiced optimism about President Trump's new reciprocal tariffs, suggesting they would encourage global trade reordering and increased market access for American goods.  He emphasized the focus on addressing non-tariff trade barriers.  This announcement follows President Trump's executive order authorizing retaliatory tariffs against nations imposing duties on US products. The situation is developing, and further updates are expected.</p>

The White House is considering a 232 investigation into the pharmaceutical industry, which could lead to import tariffs.  While some companies are lobbying for a phased approach, analysts suggest that any relief might be short-lived due to the complexities of pharmaceutical supply chains. (not investment advice)
