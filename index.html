          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described the situation in Gaza as a "horror show," citing an unprecedented level of death and destruction from Israel's military campaign. The World Health Organization reported that its facilities in Gaza were stormed by Israeli forces, with staff and family members being detained and interrogated. International condemnation is growing, with France's foreign minister calling the humanitarian situation a "scandal" and demanding an immediate end to military operations. The conflict continues to devastate the region, with the humanitarian system reportedly on the verge of collapse.</p>

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's experienced a massive surge on Tuesday, echoing the meme stock rallies of previous years. The stock price more than doubled before partially retreating, with trading volume nearly 17 times higher than its 30-day average. The volatility appears driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who noted the stock's high short interest, making it a candidate for a short squeeze. This market activity comes despite Kohl's underlying business struggles, including falling sales and leadership instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Understanding Grace Periods for Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the nuances of credit card grace periods, which are often misunderstood by consumers. While most cards offer a grace period on new purchases, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if they pay their balance in full each month, this benefit typically does not extend to late payments. Missing a payment due date can result in immediate consequences such as late fees, penalty APRs, and potential damage to one's credit score if the payment is over 30 days late. The article advises proactive communication with card issuers and exploring debt relief options if consistently struggling to make timely payments.</p>

          <p>Germany has deported 43 Iraqi citizens, all described as single men required to leave the country, some with criminal convictions. The deportation is part of a broader trend, with German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt advocating for a stricter European migration policy, including repatriations to countries like Syria and Afghanistan. Separately, the German government is facing internal pressure to adopt a firmer stance against Israel's military conduct in Gaza, with some coalition members urging Chancellor Friedrich Merz to join an international call for an immediate ceasefire. These events highlight Germany's complex role in navigating both domestic and international crises.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has announced he will meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein, in the coming days. The meeting is intended to determine if Maxwell has information about other individuals who may have committed crimes, following President Trump's directive to release all credible evidence. Maxwell's appellate counsel confirmed discussions are underway and stated she will always testify truthfully. This development occurs as a House subcommittee moves to subpoena Maxwell for testimony, and the Justice Department actively opposes her appeal of a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the estate of the late tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his former business partner, Sushovan Hussain, owe £700 million to Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's software company, Autonomy, with the court finding that the company's finances were misrepresented during the sale. HPE had initially sought up to $5 billion in damages, alleging that Lynch and Hussain fraudulently inflated Autonomy's value. The final damages amount will be determined in a future hearing, concluding a long-running and high-profile legal battle.</p>

          <p>A new study from Harvard University suggests that the odds of having a boy or a girl may not be a simple 50/50 chance with each birth. After analyzing over 58,000 women's birthing records, researchers found a pattern of "sex clustering" in families, indicating a potential biological tendency toward one sex. For example, after a family has three boys, the probability of the next child being a boy rises to 61%. The study identified a woman's age at her first birth as a correlating factor, though the precise biological mechanism remains uncertain and requires further research.</p>

As platforms like YouTube and Reddit become inundated with dubious AI posts and interactions on dating apps feel increasingly synthetic, the real world offers a more trustworthy alternative. The author suggests that the degradation of online experiences, from search results to social media, makes activities like reading physical books, shopping at local stores, and engaging in face-to-face conversations more appealing.

While the observed brain aging may be reversible, the study adds to a growing body of evidence on the pandemic's long-term neurological and cognitive impacts.

          <h2>Trump's Immigration Chief Vows to 'Flood the Zone' in Sanctuary Cities</h2>

          <p>Tom Homan, Donald Trump’s appointed border czar, has announced that the administration will intensify its focus on sanctuary cities, vowing to “flood the zone” with ICE agents. This renewed targeting follows the shooting of an off-duty officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person. Homan stated that if local jails do not cooperate with federal agents, arrests will be made in the community, and any other undocumented individuals present will also be detained. The policy reflects the administration's hardline stance against cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Food giants like General Mills, PepsiCo, and Kraft Heinz are increasingly focusing on high-protein products to meet rising consumer demand. General Mills generated over $100 million from its protein cereal lines, while Kraft Heinz is rebranding existing products like Lunchables to highlight their protein content. This trend, partly fueled by social media influencers and users of new weight-loss drugs, has also spurred a wave of new startups like David Protein Bars and Protein Pints ice cream. The market for protein-rich foods is expanding rapidly, with companies investing heavily in new product development and marketing to capture this growing segment.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will introduce a version of its classic soft drink made with U.S. cane sugar, set to launch later this year. The move comes shortly after President Donald Trump posted on social media that he had convinced the company to make the switch from high-fructose corn syrup. The company's CEO clarified that this new offering is an "and" strategy, meant to complement its existing portfolio rather than replace it entirely. While proponents claim cane sugar is better, health experts note that excess sugar from any source is detrimental, and the change is unlikely to have a significant nutritional impact.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Opposition to Fed Chair Powell is Political, Not Economic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 10:42:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that President Trump's hostility towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is driven by a desire for the central bank to serve his political interests. The author argues that Trump's stance on monetary policy shifts predictably: he advocates for low interest rates under Republican presidents to boost the economy and high rates under Democrats to slow it down. This pattern suggests Trump views the Fed not as an independent steward of the economy, but as a political tool to be wielded for partisan advantage. The feud is therefore not about Powell's competence but about Trump's rejection of the Fed's apolitical mission.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested in Indianapolis after allegedly impersonating a public servant to bypass security at a local hospital. According to court documents, the man flashed a fake "Homeland Security" badge, which allowed him to enter the facility with a knife while accompanying the mother of his child. The woman later informed staff that she feared for her safety due to the man's history of domestic abuse, prompting a police investigation. The man admitted to officers that the badge was a movie prop, leading to his arrest on multiple preliminary charges, including impersonation and domestic battery.</p>
