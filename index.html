          <p>This New York Times article previews the spring art auctions, noting a recalibration in the art market due to economic uncertainty and challenges like tariffs. The auctions feature fewer artworks estimated above $50 million compared to previous years, signaling a more conservative approach. Key artworks to watch include a Giacometti bust and a Mondrian painting, which will test the market's strength. The article also highlights the increasing prominence of female artists like Olga de Amaral, whose tapestry is featured in a major evening auction, marking a shift in the art world.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has announced its immigration policy, which aims to reduce net migration through controlled and selective measures. Key proposals include tightening skilled worker visa requirements, expanding eligibility for high-potential individuals, and doubling the time required for permanent residency to 10 years. A dedicated visa for social care providers will be abolished, and English language test requirements will be increased. The party aims to significantly reduce net migration without setting an overall cap, focusing on workforce training and addressing exploitation in specific sectors.</p>

          <p>The US and Iran concluded their fourth round of nuclear talks in Oman, described as "difficult but useful," with an agreement to continue working on technical elements. These talks occurred as President Trump prepared for a Middle East tour, and Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei reiterated anti-American sentiments. The Trump administration has set a 60-day timeframe to reach an agreement, opposing uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. Analysts suggest Iran aims to preserve its enrichment operation, while the US seeks to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The Federalist Society, while benefiting from President Trump's judicial appointments, displayed ambivalence towards his second term at a recent gathering. Speakers voiced concerns about "the chaos" within the administration, fearing it could hinder deregulation efforts. Some even advocated for limiting Trump's power, echoing sentiments usually found among Democratic lawyers. The society focused on the nondelegation doctrine to challenge Trump's tariffs, aiming to reallocate power to the judiciary. DOGE, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, also faced criticism for worsening problems within the federal workforce.</p>

While the course is meticulously crafted with the support of Christie's family, the author argues that it is a parlor trick and that Christie deserves more than a course that makes news mainly because of its use of dreaded AI. The author suggests that Christie deserves a movie, a miniseries, a play, or an actor who worries less about the face and more about the words, and the life that inspired them.</p>

          <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times argues that Congress should amend the tax code to help victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires rebuild their properties. The current tax law discourages fire victims from selling their lots due to income tax implications, and it discourages potential buyers from purchasing empty lots. The proposed reforms include exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales, and allowing deferral of income taxes for buyers who build new residences in the fire areas. These changes aim to incentivize rebuilding and restore the tax base in affected communities.</p>

          <p>New research on chimpanzees reveals that their communication includes rhythmic drumming and call combinations, two key components of human speech. Studies analyzing drumming patterns in African rainforests show that chimps use different rhythmic structures, similar to regional accents, suggesting learned behavior. Additionally, analysis of call combinations indicates that combining calls alters their meaning, akin to forming words. These findings support the idea that rhythmic structures and call combinations were present early in human evolution, shedding light on the origins of human language.</p>
