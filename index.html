          <p>A new HBO docuseries is bringing renewed attention to the unsolved 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, a crime that has haunted the city for over three decades. The case has seen convictions overturned due to questionable interrogation methods and a lack of physical evidence, leaving the brutal slayings officially unresolved. With recent advancements in DNA technology reportedly linking crime scene evidence to an unknown male, there is renewed hope among investigators and family members. The series aims to highlight alleged investigative missteps and hopes the renewed public interest will finally lead to justice for the victims.</p>

          <p>Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, is set to sign an executive order directing city agencies to resist the Trump administration's planned immigration enforcement operations. The order affirms that Chicago police will not collaborate with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement and encourages city departments to pursue all legal avenues to oppose federal efforts. This move comes in response to the administration's 'border czar' announcing a ramp-up of operations in Chicago and other sanctuary cities. The conflict highlights the escalating tensions between Democratic-run cities and the federal government's aggressive stance on immigration, with Illinois' governor calling potential National Guard deployment an 'invasion'.</p>

          <p>Famed chef Gordon Ramsay has announced his diagnosis with Basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, through a post on his Instagram account. He shared a photo of his face bandaged below the ear, thanking his medical team for the swift removal of the carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma is typically caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and often appears on sun-exposed areas like the face and neck. The 58-year-old chef used his diagnosis as a public service announcement, urging his followers to use sunscreen, especially over the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has canceled his scheduled trip to Beijing for a 'Victory Day' parade, as protests in his country have intensified and spread beyond the capital, Jakarta. The demonstrations, which began over lawmakers' pay and were exacerbated by a fatal police-involved traffic incident, have resulted in several regional parliament buildings being set on fire. A presidential spokesperson stated that Prabowo wants to remain in Indonesia to monitor the situation directly and find solutions to the unrest. The cancellation marks the first significant political test for Prabowo's government, which has been in power for nearly a year.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time after false rumors of his death trended on social media platforms. He was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia, appearing to be in good health. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from his running mate, J.D. Vance, who spoke about being prepared to assume the presidency in the event of a tragedy, raising concerns about Trump's well-being.

          <p>Liverpool has submitted an improved £35 million offer for Crystal Palace's central defender, Marc Guehi, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, requesting an additional £5 million in bonuses, and talks between the two football clubs are ongoing as the transfer deadline approaches. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a transfer likely as his current deal expires next summer. Crystal Palace is actively seeking to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's departure to Liverpool before the window closes.</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, instructing him to return to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was made after another Chelsea striker, Liam Delap, suffered a serious hamstring injury during a match, which could sideline him for up to eight weeks. The sudden reversal left Jackson reportedly angry and created a precarious situation for Chelsea, which was momentarily left with only one fit senior striker. The club is now expected to try and salvage the situation, though Jackson is currently set to remain with Chelsea.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebel movement has officially confirmed that its self-proclaimed Prime Minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the capital, Sanaa. The strike, which the Israel Defense Forces described as targeting a Houthi 'military target,' also reportedly killed several other senior officials, including the foreign and justice ministers. Rahawi, who held the post since 2024, was considered more of a figurehead than a key military decision-maker. The attack marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, where Houthis have been targeting Israel and commercial shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal, a process allowing for the rapid deportation of migrants without a full court hearing. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb found the administration's policy of applying this process to migrants in the interior of the country, who cannot prove they have been present for over two years, to be unlawful. This decision curtails the government's ability to detain and deport individuals with little due process, particularly those arrested at courthouses. The judge emphasized that the government's legal arguments posed a threat to the due process rights of all individuals, not just noncitizens.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared an end to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters of the severe pneumonia-like illness.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can reportedly detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. The device analyzes subtle differences in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable by the human ear and compares them against a large patient database. A study involving over 12,000 patients in London GP surgeries found that the AI tool significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions. The British Heart Foundation has called the innovation a potential 'game-changer' for enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment, with plans to roll it out further across the UK.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted a massive overnight aerial assault on Ukraine, targeting 14 regions with nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, according to Ukrainian officials. The attacks resulted in at least one fatality and 30 injuries, with significant damage to infrastructure in the Dnipropetrovsk region and a residential building in Dnipro. In response, Ukraine's military reported successful drone strikes on two Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the barrage and called for stronger international sanctions against Moscow as diplomatic efforts to end the war remain stalled.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several local councils in the UK are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a potential precedent, but councils in West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne have confirmed they will continue their legal fights, citing planning law breaches and public safety concerns. The government maintains that using hotels is not a sustainable long-term solution but that the court's decision allows for an orderly transition. The issue has sparked protests and remains a contentious political flashpoint across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's broad imposition of 'reciprocal tariffs' on nearly all trading partners represents an illegal overreach of executive power. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used to justify the levies, does not grant the authority to impose such taxes. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for a potential appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision creates significant uncertainty for businesses and could have widespread effects on the U.S. economy and international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the rules and eligibility for Social Security survivor benefits, which are paid to the spouses, ex-spouses, and children of deceased workers who paid into the system. Generally, a surviving spouse must be at least 60 years old, or 50 if disabled, to qualify, though age requirements can be waived if caring for a young or disabled child. The article notes that remarriage before a certain age can affect eligibility and that working while receiving benefits may reduce the payment amount. It advises individuals to contact the Social Security Administration promptly after a spouse's death to understand their options for maximizing their benefits over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a landmark study identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to Iowa's severe water quality problems, public funding intended to promote the report's findings has been mysteriously withdrawn. The $1 million study, conducted by 16 scientists, linked contaminants from the state's powerful farm industry to health risks, including high cancer rates. According to sources, over $400,000 remaining in the budget, partly earmarked for public awareness campaigns, was 'zeroed out' without explanation by Polk County officials. This move has raised concerns among environmental advocates that political and industry pressure is stifling efforts to address the state's growing water crisis.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could seriously jeopardize the central bank's political independence. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy and lead to negative long-term economic consequences, such as higher inflation, a weaker currency, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she believes the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy and investor confidence.

The Palestinian leadership condemned the decision as a violation of U.S. commitments as the UN's host nation and urged the international community to pressure the Trump administration to reverse it.

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, that were revealed due to receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought plaguing the country for five consecutive years has lowered the water in Iraq's largest reservoir to historic lows, allowing archaeological teams to access the previously submerged site. The tombs are thought to date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. Researchers are now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is once again submerged by water.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has blocked the scheduled execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, who was convicted of a 1986 murder and had chosen to die by firing squad. His attorneys successfully argued that his dementia is so severe he can no longer understand why he is being executed, which would make the act unconstitutional. The court ruled that a lower court must re-evaluate his competency, acknowledging that his mental state may have significantly worsened since his last evaluation. The decision aligns with U.S. Supreme Court precedents that prohibit executing individuals who lack a rational understanding of their punishment.</p>

          <p>The restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has reversed its recent rebranding effort after facing intense backlash from conservative commentators and former President Donald Trump. The company's move to a minimalist logo and the removal of 'Old Country Store' from its branding were criticized as 'woke.' After Trump publicly called for the company to revert to its old logo, Cracker Barrel announced it would do so, leading to a rebound in its stock price. The incident is seen as another example of the significant influence the MAGA movement and right-wing online voices can exert on corporate decision-making in the current political climate.</p>
