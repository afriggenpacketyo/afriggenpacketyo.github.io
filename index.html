          <p>The Trump administration's approach to South Africa has been influenced by interactions with Afrikaner activists, disputes over Israel, and a focus on diversity and inclusion programs. The administration is now prioritizing Afrikaner refugees, citing discrimination and persecution, while suspending the program for others. This decision follows months of diplomatic tension, including the halting of foreign aid to South Africa and the expulsion of the South African ambassador. The article notes that Trump's views were shaped by figures like Gary Player and Elon Musk, amplifying misinformation about white South Africans. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>Forty years after the MOVE bombing in Philadelphia, some argue the city hasn't done enough to rectify the 'unconscionable' act. On May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police dropped a bomb on a rowhome in Cobbs Creek, killing 11 people, including five children. The MOVE Commission report described the decision to bomb the home as 'unconscionable'. The city has been faulted for its described negligent handling of the matter. Optimism score is 25.</p>

          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, this article looks back at how unfair representation in early Hollywood led to the creation of one of the first Chinese American film studios in the country. Frustrations with one-dimensional and demeaning characters led to the founding of the Great Wall Film Company in 1921. The streets of the city can look almost unrecognizable more than 100 years later, but researchers say I.S. 281 Joseph B. Cavallaro along Cropsey Avenue in Gravesend now stands on the site of the former studio. The studio eventually moved to Shanghai, producing around two dozen films in a decade.
