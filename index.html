          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations allegedly related to Iran's nuclear program. The commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, was killed in a targeted strike, along with two leading nuclear scientists, according to Iranian media. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, pledged to avenge the attacks, while Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency, warning of an expected Iranian missile and drone attack. Oil prices jumped more than 8% and U.S. stock futures fell amid fears of a broader regional war, with the U.S. stating it was not involved but had been briefed beforehand. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem directed employees and families to shelter in place.</p>

A three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit scheduled a hearing in the case, meaning the National Guard will remain federalized through the weekend.

          <p>A federal judge in California issued a temporary restraining order blocking President Trump from deploying California National Guard troops during protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The order would have returned control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The judge called Trump's actions "illegal" and stated that they exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment. The order was set to take effect on Friday, but the Trump administration filed an emergency motion with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily delayed a lower court's order that would have prevented the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay and scheduled a hearing for June 17. This action followed a federal judge's earlier ruling that Trump's deployment of the National Guard during protests over immigration raids was unlawful and that control should be returned to Governor Gavin Newsom. The lower court judge emphasized the importance of First Amendment rights and stated that the protests did not constitute a rebellion justifying federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, characterized by the Israeli government as a ‚Äúpreemptive‚Äù strike, while others view it as a preventive war. A preemptive attack is meant to thwart an imminent attack, while a preventive war involves removing the source of a threat on one's own terms, which carries significant moral and practical risks. The article draws parallels to historical examples of preventive actions and questions whether the threat from Iran's nuclear program required immediate action. The decision is laden with immense danger, especially because there is no such thing as utter finality in war.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's ruling that restricted the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay while it considers the administration's appeal. The initial ruling by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer stated that California officials were likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles. The judge argued that Trump circumvented Governor Newsom and did not follow the necessary procedural requirements.</p>
