          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, has been fired by the Department of Justice. Comey was a respected assistant U.S. attorney who recently led the prosecution against Sean "Diddy" Combs and previously secured a conviction against Ghislaine Maxwell. Sources suggest that President Trump, who had previously fired her father, former FBI Director James Comey, had privately expressed frustration about her employment within his administration. The Justice Department has not provided an official comment on the termination.</p>

          <p>Former ESPN host Samantha Ponder has publicly stated she believes her firing was linked to her vocal support for women's sports protections regarding transgender athletes. Ponder described receiving warnings from ESPN executives after posting on social media about the issue, leading her to feel she was "on the clock." While acknowledging other factors like cost could have been involved, she asserts the timing strongly suggests her public stance was the primary catalyst. Ponder expressed no bitterness, viewing the dismissal as a necessary push to leave a career she felt constrained by.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has stalled in the House of Representatives due to ongoing opposition from a group of conservative Republicans. Despite last-minute negotiations and an intervention from President Trump, new objections arose over proposed changes, preventing the legislation from advancing to a full debate. The stalemate casts doubt on the Republican conference's ability to unify on crypto policy and threatens the passage of key bills, including a proposed ban on a central bank digital currency. This development is a significant disappointment for the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's fundraising efforts for his future presidential library are drawing scrutiny due to the lack of regulations and transparency surrounding donor identities. Critics, including Senate Democrats, are proposing legislation to regulate such fundraising, citing concerns that large donations from corporations and special interests could be a form of bribery. The proposed bill would cap individual donations at $10,000 during a president's term and require public disclosure. Currently, funding is largely opaque, with millions potentially flowing from legal settlements and inaugural funds into the library's nonprofit foundations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning for the state's southern peninsula. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory, as officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but did not expect large, widespread inundation due to the quake's shallow depth. The earthquake was felt throughout the Alaska Peninsula, a seismically active region known as the Pacific "Ring of Fire." Authorities confirmed there was no immediate danger to Anchorage, the state's most populous city, following the event.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant market instability if President Trump follows through on suggestions that he might fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Despite Trump's public denial of an imminent plan, his ongoing criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates has fueled speculation. Experts, including former Treasury officials, believe such a move would be a "dreadful idea" that could lead to an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The legality of firing a Fed chair for policy disagreements is questionable and would likely result in a Supreme Court battle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than three months after President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on most imports, this article questions when American consumers will actually bear the cost. Despite predictions that consumers would pay the price, the direct impact has been complicated by fluctuating tariff rates, particularly on Chinese goods, and various product-specific levies. The central theme explored is the delay between the implementation of these taxes on imported goods and the moment those increased costs are passed on to shoppers at the retail level. The piece reflects on the ongoing economic uncertainty created by the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

For those new to exercise, starting with shorter walks and gradually increasing the duration to 30 minutes is an effective strategy.

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, but issued a new, more cautious forecast for the full year. The airline's CEO noted that while travel demand is picking up after a weak start to 2025, challenges remain, including operational constraints at its Newark hub. The company now expects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025, a reduction from a more optimistic scenario presented earlier in the year. The report indicates that while premium travel remains strong, domestic revenue has weakened, reflecting broader economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 20 children, mostly toddlers, have been taken into the custody of a California child-welfare agency amid an investigation into a Los Angeles-area couple. The investigation began after an infant in their care was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly caused by a nanny. Authorities are now examining whether the couple, Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan, misled multiple surrogate mothers around the country, as they are listed as the legal parents for all the children. The FBI is involved in the case, which has raised questions about surrogacy laws and potential neglect.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans is finalizing a bankruptcy plan to settle 633 clergy abuse claims, but investors are arguing that about half of these claims could be legally dismissed. Arguments in court suggest that many claims were filed past deadlines or are duplicates, which, if successful, could significantly reduce the number of eligible survivors. This could jeopardize the entire settlement, as a smaller pool of voters might make it easier for opponents to reject the deal. The proposed settlement includes at least $180 million and a public archive of files on credibly accused clergy.</p>

          <p>This article provides a chronological review of President Trump's public statements regarding Jeffrey Epstein, highlighting his evolving rhetoric from his first term to the present. Initially, Trump distanced himself, claiming he "wasn't a fan" after having a falling out, but later suggested Epstein may have been killed. On the campaign trail, he pledged to release the Epstein files, a promise that energized his base. Now in office, he has abruptly reversed course, dismissing the matter as a "Democratic hoax" and lashing out at his own supporters for their continued interest, creating significant political backlash.</p>

          <p>In a landmark medical achievement, doctors in the UK have successfully used a pioneering technique involving DNA from three people to prevent eight babies from inheriting devastating mitochondrial diseases. The method combines the nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a female donor's egg, ensuring the child is free from the often-fatal genetic conditions passed down by the mother. This is the first confirmation that the procedure, which has been legal in the UK for a decade, is effective. The children are all reportedly healthy and meeting developmental milestones.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed he has discussed firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell but stated that such a move is "highly unlikely." The statement came hours after reports that he had asked Republican lawmakers about sacking Powell, causing brief market volatility. Trump has been openly critical of Powell, whom he appointed, for not lowering interest rates more aggressively. While the president can legally remove Fed governors "for cause," this is typically understood as serious misconduct, not policy disagreement. The continued public pressure on the Fed's independence is a source of concern for financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>
