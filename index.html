          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill with a narrow 215-214 vote, marking a significant victory for Republicans. The bill, comprising over 1,000 pages of legislation and amendments, garnered support from most Republicans while facing unanimous opposition from Democrats, along with a few dissenting Republicans. The bill includes tax cuts paired with adjustments to the social safety net, and it now faces a complex path through the Senate, where it will be considered under budget reconciliation rules, requiring a simple majority for passage.</p>

          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing, which took nearly a decade to develop. The High NA machine is larger than a double-decker bus and comprised of four modules manufactured in different countries. It takes seven partially loaded Boeing 747s to ship one system to a customer. The world's first commercial installation occurred at Intel's Oregon chip fabrication plant in 2024, with only five machines shipped to date. High NA is the latest generation of ASML's Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) machines, and it improves chip performance, speed, and yield, reducing cycle time by 60%.</p>

          <p>Lenovo Group, the world's largest PC maker, reported robust annual results driven by strong demand for AI products, with revenue up 21% to $69.1 billion and net income rising 37% to $1.4 billion. However, the company is grappling with unexpected tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, which have negatively impacted its most recent quarter. CEO Yang Yuanqing expressed surprise at the sudden implementation of the tariffs, describing the financial hit as significant and affecting profit growth.

          <p>BBC Verify investigated claims made by Donald Trump during a tense White House meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, focusing on allegations of a "genocide" against white farmers. Trump presented footage of crosses, claiming they marked graves of murdered farmers, but BBC Verify geolocated the footage to a protest site where the crosses represented murdered commercial farmers. While South Africa does have a high murder rate, statistics do not support claims of a "white genocide." Trump also played footage of politicians singing "Kill the Boer," but BBC Verify found that those leading the rallies were not currently holding official government positions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global bonds are experiencing a sell-off due to Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and President Trump's tax bill, raising fiscal concerns among investors. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield broke above 5%, while Japan's 40-year government bond yield hit a record high. Factors driving the sell-off include declining confidence in U.S. assets, structural changes in Japan's bond market, and the removal of Germany's debt brake. The bond sell-off poses a problem for U.S. sovereign debt, encouraging divestment from the U.S. as Japanese assets become an attractive alternative for local investors.</p>

          <p>A new trend involves punishing women who allege abuse by high-profile figures through organized attacks by their abusers' fans on social media. This method, rooted in the "deny, attack, reverse victim and offender" (Darvo) tactic, has been amplified by social media, where powerful figures mobilize fan armies to discredit accusers. Examples include the harassment of Halle Bailey after she obtained a restraining order against DDG, the attacks on Amber Heard during and after the Johnny Depp trial, and the abuse faced by Jennifer Hough after accusing Nicki Minaj's husband of sexual assault. This culture is fueled by online misogyny and a demand for loyalty to male figures, compromising public opinion and making it difficult for women to be believed.</p>

Critics argue that this anti-empathy stance often targets marginalized communities and liberal perspectives, while scholars like Karen Swallow Prior view it as a backlash against questioning authority.

However, the revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>

Premier Danielle Smith seeks leverage to renegotiate Alberta’s relationship with Ottawa, aiming to unshackle the province’s oil industry from climate regulations.
