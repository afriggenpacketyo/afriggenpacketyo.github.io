          <p>Lalo Schifrin, the Argentine-born composer, pianist, and conductor renowned for creating the iconic theme for "Mission: Impossible," has passed away at the age of 93. His prolific career spanned film and television, earning him six Oscar nominations and four Grammy Awards for scores like "Cool Hand Luke" and "Dirty Harry." Schifrin's instantly recognizable "Mission: Impossible" theme, written in an unusual 5/4 time signature, became a cultural touchstone and a hallmark of the long-running franchise. A classically trained musician who also made significant contributions to jazz, he collaborated with legends like Dizzy Gillespie and was honored with an honorary Oscar in 2018 for his vast contributions to film music.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will continue his bid for New York City mayor as an independent candidate, forgoing the option to withdraw from the race. This decision follows his surprising defeat in the Democratic primary to Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old progressive state assemblyman who ran on a platform focused on the city's high cost of living. Although Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's primary victory, he is leveraging an independent ballot line he had previously secured, suggesting the primary electorate is not representative of the entire city. Cuomo's persistence in the race, despite resigning from the governorship in 2021 amid multiple scandals, sets up a contentious general election against Mamdani and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for 10 games for violating the league's Personal Conduct Policy, following an investigation into numerous sexual misconduct allegations. The suspension is the result of a probe into claims from at least 16 massage therapists who accused Tucker of inappropriate conduct between 2012 and 2016. Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May, has consistently denied the allegations but has reportedly accepted the resolution to move forward. As one of the most accurate kickers in NFL history and a Super Bowl champion, the suspension marks a significant downfall for the highly decorated player.</p>

          <p>China's Defence Ministry has issued a stark warning to the Philippines, cautioning it against "self-inflicted destruction" for hosting U.S. missile systems. The statement came after the Philippines confirmed that anti-ship missile systems used in recent joint military exercises would remain in the country as a deterrent. A Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman characterized the move as binding the Philippines to the "US war machine," asserting it would undermine regional security and stability. This escalation in rhetoric highlights the growing tensions in the South China Sea, as Manila deepens its military alliance with Washington in response to Beijing's increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is making a final push for a major tax-and-spending bill, though he has backed away from his initial July 4th deadline for its passage. The proposed legislation includes an extension of his first-term tax cuts and increased funding for immigration enforcement, which Trump argues will benefit working families. However, the bill faces strong opposition from Democrats, who have labeled it the ‚Äúbig, ugly betrayal‚Äù for its significant proposed cuts to social programs. Critics point to an estimated 16 million people who could lose their health insurance due to Medicaid reductions and slashes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), highlighting the deep political divide over the bill's priorities.</p>

          <p>A classified briefing on the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities has left Republican and Democratic senators with sharply conflicting interpretations of the mission's success. The briefing, led by top national security officials, was intended to clarify the impact of the strikes, which President Trump claimed had "obliterated" Iran's program. Republicans like Lindsey Graham echoed this sentiment, stating the sites were set back by years, while Democrats such as Chris Murphy accused the administration of misleading the public. The deep partisan divide was further inflamed by a Trump social media post blaming Democrats for leaking intelligence, underscoring the lack of political consensus on a critical national security issue.</p>

It disintegrated 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, creating a pressure wave that resulted in loud booms heard by residents on the ground.

          <p>Japan has carried out the execution of Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted for the 2017 murders of nine people in Zama, Kanagawa Prefecture. Shiraishi, infamously known as the "Twitter killer," was sentenced to death for luring individuals with suicidal thoughts to his apartment via social media, where he then killed and dismembered them. The case shocked the nation and prompted discussions about online safety and mental health support. His death sentence was finalized in 2021 after he withdrew his appeal, and the execution marks the conclusion of one of Japan's most gruesome modern criminal cases.

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city particularly vulnerable to the Urban Heat Island effect, an innovative project is transforming a single neighborhood block into a model for cooling dense urban areas. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, employs a multi-pronged strategy that includes planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with heat-reflecting light colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures are designed to combat peak temperatures that can be up to 20 degrees hotter than in greener areas. As climate change intensifies heat waves, this urban laboratory provides a practical template for other cities seeking to protect residents and improve livability through strategic green infrastructure.</p>

This move goes against established scientific consensus on the safety of the mercury-based preservative, which is already used in less than 4% of U.S. flu shots. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, who argue it undermines public trust in vaccines by re-litigating settled science. The panel, composed of Kennedy's own picks after he fired the previous experts, also announced a broader review of all recommended pediatric vaccines.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, the company's Vice President of Manufacturing and Operations, amid a period of declining car sales in key markets. Afshar, who reported directly to Musk, oversaw critical areas including North American sales and operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. His dismissal follows a 19% drop in Tesla's stock price this year and a five-month decline in European sales as the company faces increased competition. This high-level termination adds to recent executive departures and signals ongoing turmoil at the automaker as it navigates brand reputation challenges and intense market pressures from both legacy and new electric vehicle manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory over Israel, claiming the nation was "crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic." In a video address, he asserted that Iran had successfully hit numerous military targets and delivered "a big slap in the face" to the U.S. by attacking its airbase in Qatar. However, these claims stand in stark contrast to reports from the U.S. and Israel, which state that Iran's missile attacks caused limited damage while Israeli and U.S. counter-strikes severely damaged Iran's nuclear facilities. The rhetoric appears aimed at a domestic audience amid palpable anxiety in Tehran following the conflict.</p>

The felony conviction forfeits his right to vote or hold office, ending a controversial political career where he gained support from high-profile right-wing figures but never won an election.

This expansion contributed to what he describes as a 60-fold increase in rates, turning a narrowly defined, severe disorder into a much more common spectrum.

While the government insists progress is being made and that performance will improve, patients like 73-year-old John Winnik report living in constant pain while waiting months for treatment.

          <p>Brendan Foley, CEO of spice maker McCormick, stated that the company is actively focused on mitigating the impact of new tariffs, particularly on its agricultural supply chain. In an interview, Foley explained that while 90% of the company's products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, many key ingredients like black pepper must be sourced from various international markets. He noted that McCormick has done a "nice job" navigating the tariff situation so far and that the company is benefiting from a sustained consumer trend of cooking more meals at home. Foley emphasized that the company's broad portfolio and focus on flavor allows it to adapt to economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Stock Market Rally is Broad and Bullish</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 18:52:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that the current stock market rally is much broader than critics claim, refuting warnings that its narrow leadership made it unsustainable. He pointed to a diverse group of top S&P 500 performers from a single day to illustrate his point, including a solar company (Enphase), a copper miner (Freeport-McMoRan), a crypto platform (Coinbase), and a biotech outfit (Incyte). Cramer argued that this wide range of successful sectors demonstrates the market's underlying strength. He declared that those who bet against the market due to its perceived narrowness are now being proven wrong by the broad-based bullish activity. (not investment advice)</p>
