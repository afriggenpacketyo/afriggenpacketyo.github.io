          <p>Paul Doyle, a former Royal Marine, appeared in Liverpool Magistrates' Court facing charges related to driving his car into a crowd after Liverpool FC's trophy parade. Doyle faces seven charges, including wounding with intent and dangerous driving, after 79 people were injured on Water Street. The incident occurred during celebrations for Liverpool FC's Premier League title win, where a pram was hit, though the baby was unharmed. A fundraising campaign has raised over Â£30,000 for those affected, including a donation from Jamie Carragher's charity foundation. Mr. Doyle will next appear at Liverpool Crown Court for a hearing.</p>

This response comes after ICE announced the arrest of an MS-13 member, noting previous instances where the Montgomery County Detention Center failed to honor immigration detainers for the individual. Elrich acknowledged the error and reiterated the county's policy of cooperating with ICE in specific cases, emphasizing that the designation is politically motivated.

          <p>OpenAI, valued at $300 billion, is grappling with its nonprofit origins as it seeks to dominate the AI industry with products like ChatGPT. Founded in 2015 with a mission for safe and beneficial AI, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 to attract investors, but its nonprofit status has become a constraint. After facing investor concerns, OpenAI initially proposed transitioning to a for-profit structure, but later backtracked, deciding to keep the nonprofit in charge following scrutiny from regulators and critics. Despite the structural debate, OpenAI continues to expand its AI infrastructure and develop new products, striving to balance its founding mission with the competitive pressures of the market.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, has been introduced in the Senate to require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles. The bill has garnered support from organizations across the political spectrum, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and anti-abortion groups. The proposed legislation aims to alleviate the financial burden of childbirth for American families, where out-of-pocket costs for privately insured families average nearly $3,000. The bill would expand the list of essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act and would be paid for by insurance companies and modest increases in premiums.</p>

Cabinda, rich in oil resources, has been seeking independence from Angola for about 50 years, citing its distinct cultural and historical identity.

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, surpassing economists' expectations, despite global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the government's fiscal year 2025, with the full fiscal year expanding by 6.5%. The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports, which have helped cushion the impact of U.S. trade policies. While the U.S. has imposed tariffs on goods imported from India, negotiations for a potential trade deal are ongoing, with India reportedly offering zero tariffs on U.S. imports.

The study, which tested craft beer, major domestic brands, and international labels, found a strong correlation between PFAS levels in the beer and the local water supply. The levels detected often exceeded drinking water limits for PFAS, prompting calls for brewers, consumers, and policymakers to address the risks. Researchers suggest that brewers should install advanced filtration systems, and consumers can check PFAS levels in their beer's bottling location.</p>

This shift in tone comes as polling shows Earle-Sears trailing the Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, with some strategists citing fundraising struggles and controversial comments.

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, now believes the established theory might be incorrect. Riess's measurements of cosmic distances have led to a discrepancy known as the Hubble tension, challenging the standard model of cosmology. While some cosmologists remain skeptical, Riess argues that the Hubble tension suggests a fundamental flaw in the theory. New data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) hints that dark energy may be weakening, potentially altering our understanding of the universe's fate.</p>

          <p>Israel is facing increased global condemnation over its ongoing war in Gaza, with critics citing the high civilian death toll and dire humanitarian crisis. Left-wing Israeli politician Yair Golan sparked controversy by stating that Israel risks becoming a pariah state, reflecting growing dissent within the country. The conflict, which began after an attack by Hamas in 2023, has resulted in over 50,000 Palestinian deaths and widespread devastation in Gaza. The escalating strikes and aid blockade have drawn criticism from figures like Theo Von and Ms. Rachel, as well as international leaders, suggesting a potential inflection point in Israel's international relations.</p>

          <p>A couple is helping scientists investigate whether a nasal spray can slow down Alzheimer's by reducing brain inflammation. Joe Walsh, the first Alzheimer's patient to receive the experimental treatment, has shown reduced inflammation in his brain, according to researchers. The nasal spray contains a monoclonal antibody called foralumab, previously tested for inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, and aims to reduce the activity of microglia in the brain. While it's unclear if the treatment will improve Walsh's cognitive function, his wife has observed positive signs in his social engagement, and a clinical trial of foralumab for Alzheimer's is scheduled to begin later this year.</p>

The lawsuit asks a judge to declare that the Honolulu Police Department's practices are unconstitutional and unlawful. In addition to the ongoing review, the cases of the three plaintiffs will be internally investigated, police said: "We are dedicated to upholding public trust and will take appropriate action should any misconduct be found."</p>
