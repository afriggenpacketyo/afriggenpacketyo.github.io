          <p>Onosato has been promoted to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank, after only 13 professional tournaments, setting a record pace. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since 2017, expressing his commitment to uphold the rank's honor. He secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the requirement of consecutive championships as an ozeki. Onosato is set to compete against Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu and is the first wrestler to become yokozuna without a single losing record, with his stablemaster hoping he will lead by example and inspire others.</p>

The plan aims for over 85% of manufacturers to use computer numerical control in key processes by 2027 and to cultivate at least 100 specialized service providers. By 2030, China intends to complete a core industrial database, enabling IT manufacturers to achieve breakthroughs and ascend the global value chain.

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law that mandates 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, starting in fiscal year 2026. The law targets firms producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, covering about 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive maximum emission allowances and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding their limits, incentivizing emissions reduction. While aimed at lowering emissions, the system may lead to price increases for consumers due to decarbonization costs.</p>

While the simulation aims for fantasy, many participants use the Russia-Ukraine war as a reference, sometimes even buying uniforms from military surplus stores that source merchandise from Ukraine's battlefields.

The expert's analysis suggested the SUV accelerated rapidly before backing up, aligning with the prosecution's timeline of events. The expert also presented findings suggesting the bumper of Read's vehicle made contact with O'Keefe, and that scratch marks on O'Keefe's arm were consistent with the SUV's taillight.</p>

          <p>A report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggests that a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is "unlikely in the near future" but "not impossible," especially given potential miscommunication with the US under President Donald Trump. The US-China relationship is described as strained, characterized by deep distrust and limited dialogue. While tactical improvements occurred during the Biden administration, the report cautions that these are unlikely to significantly alter the strategic direction between the two powers during Trump's second term.

          <p>William Duplessie surrendered to police, becoming the third suspect charged in the kidnapping and torture of Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, who was held for nearly three weeks in a Manhattan townhouse. Duplessie, linked to Switzerland and Miami, faces kidnapping, assault, and weapon possession charges. Carturan, an Italian man, escaped captivity and reported being bound, whipped, and subjected to electric shocks while his captors demanded the password to his Bitcoin wallet. The case highlights a growing trend of attacks targeting crypto executives for ransom.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO exhibits a rare characteristic, with existing shareholders selling more shares (60%) than the company itself. This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO, where 57% of shares came from stakeholders. While Circle didn't specify a reason, the move likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. The company is profitable and stands to raise $240 million in the IPO, but private investors are eager for exits to distribute funds back to their investors. (not investment advice)</p>
