          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has officially moved from Liverpool to Bayern Munich in a deal valued at £65.5 million. The 28-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the German champions, ending his successful tenure at Anfield where he scored 41 goals in 148 appearances. Diaz was a key player for Liverpool, contributing significantly to their Premier League win last season and winning both the FA Cup and EFL Cup. His departure leaves a significant role to fill on Liverpool's left flank.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Far East has generated tsunami waves, prompting a tsunami warning for Hawaii and advisories for the U.S. West Coast. The first waves reaching Hawaii were relatively small, though they arrived at high tide, causing some shoreline flooding. Officials urged residents in coastal areas to move inland as a precaution, opening shelters and activating emergency response teams. The impact of the tsunami, which consists of a series of waves, could last for several hours or more.</p>

          <p>HSBC announced a $3 billion share buyback after its second-quarter profit before tax of $6.3 billion fell short of market expectations. The bank attributed the 29% year-over-year profit decline to impairment charges related to a Chinese bank and lost income from disposed businesses. Citing global economic challenges like tariffs and fiscal vulnerabilities, HSBC warned that lending demand would likely remain subdued for the rest of the year. The move is part of a broader restructuring effort to simplify operations and cut costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This essay examines the online mockery directed at NBA star Karl-Anthony Towns, whose mannerisms have been labeled "zesty" in a trend that queer-codes his behavior. The author links this phenomenon to broader societal pressures, particularly on Black men, to conform to rigid standards of masculinity and suppress expressive joy. The piece reflects on how homophobia and the policing of softness can impact individuals, regardless of their actual sexual orientation, and highlights Towns' resilience during a career-best season.</p>

          <p>A new documentary claims that the last 200 pages of a missing autobiography by Moors murderer Ian Brady could contain vital clues to the burial location of his final victim, 12-year-old Keith Bennett. The manuscript, titled "Black Light," is believed to have been given to Brady's solicitor before his death in 2017. The victim's brother is now calling for any existing material to be turned over to police in the hope of finally resolving the decades-old search.</p>

          <p>A global alliance of civil society organizations has placed the United States on a watchlist for countries experiencing a rapid decline in civic freedoms. The report from the non-profit group Civicus cites "sustained attacks on civic freedoms" under the Trump administration, including the militarized response to protests and growing restrictions on journalists. The U.S. civic space is now rated as "narrowed," a designation indicating that the state is actively impeding fundamental rights of expression and assembly.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists in China have discovered 436-million-year-old fossils that suggest an ancient marine species practiced a form of social distancing. The clam-like brachiopods were found arranged in a highly regular, checkerboard-like pattern on what was once the sea floor. Researchers believe the creatures used hundreds of thin, bristle-like structures to maintain this spacing, likely as a strategy to improve their access to food through filter-feeding.</p>

The move is intended to empower moderates on both sides and create new momentum, rather than to establish a state immediately. The article notes Israel's swift rejection of the proposal and the potential for new friction in transatlantic relations, while also exploring the deep historical context of Britain's role in the region.</p>
