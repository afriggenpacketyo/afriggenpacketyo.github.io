The assault occurred on Yom Kippur when a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians and attacked them with a knife before being shot and killed by police. The crime is being investigated as an act of terrorism, prompting condemnations from political and religious leaders amid a rise in antisemitic incidents in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair as a key figure in his 20-point plan for post-war Gaza, intended to be part of a "Board of Peace." Blair, known for his role in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement but also reviled for his involvement in the 2003 Iraq invasion, has called the plan "bold and intelligent." However, his appointment has drawn skepticism and criticism from Palestinian figures and international observers due to his controversial legacy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Following the elimination of federal funding for public media, South Dakota Public Broadcasting has been forced to make drastic cuts, significantly reducing its newsroom staff and canceling local programming. The network, which serves a largely rural and conservative population, is now relying more on national content from NPR and PBS to fill its schedule. Despite some local support and an increase in private donations, the financial blow threatens the station's ability to provide local news and educational content to its community.</p>

          <p>A Republican congressman reflects on a recent bipartisan House delegation visit to China, the first since 2019, describing an atmosphere reminiscent of the Cold War. The article argues for five key strategies to prevent conflict, including maintaining dialogue, recognizing China's strengths and weaknesses, and fortifying regional alliances with partners like Japan and South Korea. It concludes that the best way to avoid war is through preparation and strength, framing the current dynamic as a "hard peace" rather than a new Cold War.</p>

          <p>United States Men's National Team coach Mauricio Pochettino discussed his unconventional approach to communicating with players, stating he doesn't explain to them why they weren't selected for the roster. He believes players should inherently understand their performance and be "desperate to perform better" for their clubs to earn a spot. This philosophy is part of his effort to change the team's culture ahead of the 2026 World Cup, emphasizing that no player has a guaranteed place based on past achievements.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans jobless for over six months has reached its highest level since 2021, currently standing at 1.9 million people. As the hiring market cools, experienced professionals and recent graduates alike are struggling to find work, often sending out hundreds of applications with little response. This trend poses risks to both individual financial stability and the broader economy, as prolonged unemployment can lead to workers becoming discouraged and leaving the labor force entirely. The slowdown has prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to bolster the job market.</p>

          <p>At the request of the Trump administration, Apple has removed ICEBlock and similar applications from its App Store. These apps were designed to alert users to the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in their vicinity. The Justice Department argued that the apps endangered law enforcement officers by increasing their risk of being targeted. The removal follows heightened criticism after a shooting at an ICE facility where the attacker was reportedly using such an app.</p>

          <p>India and China have announced plans to resume direct flights, which were suspended in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and not reinstated due to prolonged border tensions. The move is described by the Indian embassy as part of a gradual normalization of relations between the two nations. The resumption of flights, set to begin by late October, follows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to China, signaling a potential thaw in the relationship that had frozen after a deadly border clash in 2020.</p>

          <p>A new report from Germany's federal commissioner for the eastern states examines the country 35 years after reunification, finding that significant disparities remain. While younger generations have grown up in a unified nation, those from the former East still possess a distinct identity shaped by different socioeconomic conditions. The report highlights lower incomes, less inherited wealth, and an aging population in rural eastern regions as persistent challenges that continue to divide the country, despite overall economic progress since 1990.</p>
