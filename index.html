          <p>Analysts suggest that the United States could leverage next-generation fighter jets and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), or ‚Äúloyal wingmen,‚Äù to counterbalance China's numerical advantage in military fleet size, potentially extending operational reach in the Indo-Pacific region. General David Allvin, US Air Force chief of staff, highlighted the YFQ-42A UCAV as part of the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness and lethality. Developed by General Atomics, the UCAV is undergoing ground testing, with production slated for 2026, while China is also advancing in military technology, narrowing the technological gap.</p>

In trade discussions, Japan's chief negotiator indicated that the United States is increasingly acknowledging Japan's economic significance. New farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi aims to sell government rice reserves to retailers at 2,000 yen per 5 kg to ease consumer burdens amidst rising prices.

          <p>A significant power outage impacted southeastern France, causing traffic disruptions and a temporary halt to activities at the Cannes Film Festival as it prepared for its closing ceremony. About 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department experienced electricity loss due to a fallen high-voltage line, following an earlier fire at an electrical substation near Cannes. While the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply to ensure scheduled events proceeded, screenings at the Cineum were briefly suspended.

Trump previously dismissed military academy boards, alleging leftist ideology. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these actions undermine the values and education of the academies. Two protests were planned during the ceremony. Trump's prior address in 2020 raised health concerns due to his movements.</p>

          <p>A proposed tax bill could jeopardize the clean energy boom in the US by terminating key tax credits that support solar and wind power. The bill effectively undermines the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), potentially causing a significant decline in clean energy deployment. Companies have invested billions in solar and battery storage projects since the IRA's passage, but the tax bill would eliminate tax credits for clean energy facilities. While some Republican senators have expressed reservations, the legislation could severely impact the clean energy industry and increase electricity costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are employing aggressive legislative tactics to advance former President Trump's agenda, mirroring and exceeding past criticisms of Democratic procedures. The GOP rushed a 1,100-page bill through the House with limited public review, scheduling hearings at unconventional hours and waiving procedural rules. This approach reflects a pattern of Republicans using past Democratic actions as justification to go even further in their legislative maneuvers. Despite internal misgivings, most Republicans ultimately supported the bill, prioritizing results over adherence to traditional legislative processes.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decline, reversing the spike observed during the pandemic. The FBI's 2023 crime report indicates a nearly 12% decrease in murders year-over-year, with further reductions in 2024, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Early data for 2025 suggests the possibility of the lowest murder rate in US history. The decline is attributed to the waning pandemic, the return of social services, and government interventions like community violence interruption programs. Despite the positive trends, public perception lags behind reality, influenced by bad news bias and the prevalence of crime stories in the media.</p>

This feat, detailed in a study published in Acta Acustica, marks progress in long-range undersea messaging, with potential civilian and military applications. The team, led by Professor He Chengbing, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This achievement overcomes challenges such as signal scattering, Doppler shifts, and ambient noise, paving the way for reliable underwater communication.</p>

Others suggest revising the Office for Budgetary Responsibility's remit and implementing a windfall tax on companies that profited from Covid contracts.
