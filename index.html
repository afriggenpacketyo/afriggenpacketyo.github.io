          <p>Country music legend Alan Jackson, 66, has retired from touring after a 30-year career, citing his battle with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a degenerative nerve condition affecting his motor skills, diagnosed in 2011. Jackson performed his final tour show in Milwaukee on Saturday, marking the end of his "Last Call: One More for the Road Tour." Despite health issues, Jackson plans a finale show in Nashville next summer and intends to release new music, focusing on songwriting, which he finds more fulfilling than touring. He expressed gratitude for living the American dream and blessed his fans for their support throughout his career. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation following his party's second-place finish, losing a significant number of seats and drawing close to the far-right Chega party.

          <p>In February 2020, Redcar and Cleveland Council in north-east England fell victim to a ransomware cyber-attack that crippled essential services, from bin collections to social services. A virus hidden in an email attachment spread rapidly through the council's computer network, leading to a ransom demand from hackers, with the former head of the National Cyber Safety Centre (NCSC) calling it an "unusually serious" incident. While the council refused to pay the ransom, the attack caused widespread disruption, forcing staff to revert to pen and paper and significantly delaying critical services for vulnerable residents, with the system taking 10 months to be fully restored. The Russia-based Conti Group was later identified as the group behind the attack.</p>

The election followed months of political turbulence, including the annulment of a previous vote due to claims of Russian interference, with Dan campaigning on fighting corruption and maintaining support for Ukraine.

The incident occurred when the Mexican tall ship Cuauhtémoc, carrying 277 people, lost power and drifted backward, causing its masts to hit the bridge. Senator Chuck Schumer questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have played a role in the incident, specifically citing a possible dysfunction in the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service (VTS). Officials have confirmed that the Brooklyn Bridge itself did not sustain structural damage, though a monitoring system beneath it was damaged.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, the second highest on the scale, which suggests a poor prognosis without intervention. While prostate cancer is often curable if identified and treated early, Biden's age and health indicate that the goal is to control the disease, slow progression, and preserve quality of life, with hormone-sensitive treatment, such as testosterone-blocking medication, likely to be the primary approach. Despite routine screening in men over 75 being controversial, Biden's new symptoms and functional activity justified a closer look, underscoring the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual.</p>

          <p>The United States is likely to introduce region-based tariffs instead of individual duty rates for many countries, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as the Trump administration aims to strike deals with key trading partners on reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. Bessent indicated that the administration is focused on 18 important trading relationships, with potential for regional deals covering Central America and parts of Africa, and that countries failing to negotiate in good faith would face the same tariff rates as before the pause. The reciprocal policy involves a baseline tariff of 10 percent for almost all nations and higher country-specific duties for major trading partners with trade surpluses with the United States.

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe due to climate change, with the risk predicted to more than double by 2100, prompting scientists to advocate for learning to coexist with fires. Europe is the world's fastest warming continent, and increasing urbanization and land use changes have contributed to the problem, with the highest risk in Germany's northeastern part due to large pine plantations. While the number of fires and total area burned have decreased due to improved firefighting capacity, the fires are expected to become larger and more devastating, necessitating solutions such as controlled burning, ecosystem restoration, and increased public awareness.</p>
