          <p>The European Commission has issued preliminary findings that Meta and TikTok are in breach of the EU's landmark Digital Services Act (DSA). The platforms are accused of failing to provide researchers with adequate access to public data, which is a key transparency requirement under the new law. The Commission also found Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, made it difficult for users to report illegal content and challenge moderation decisions. If these findings are upheld, the companies could face fines of up to 6% of their global annual turnover.</p>

          <p>Sheffield Wednesday, a club in England's second-tier Championship football league, has filed a notice to be placed into administration. This move comes after facing a winding-up petition from the UK's tax authority, His Majesty's Revenue & Customs. The club, which is already at the bottom of the league table, will now face a mandatory 12-point deduction, severely damaging its chances of avoiding relegation. The decision follows increased fan protests and effectively ends Dejphon Chansiri's decade-long ownership of the team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of separate bear attacks in Japan resulted in one death and four injuries, contributing to a record year for deadly assaults by the animals. Officials report that nine people have been killed by bears this year, surpassing the previous high, as the animals increasingly enter populated areas. Experts attribute this trend to factors like climate change affecting food sources and a shrinking rural human population. In response, Japan's environment minister has vowed to strengthen measures, including better management of the bear population and training for government hunters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how Philip Pullman's new book, 'The Rose Field,' the final volume in his 'Book of Dust' trilogy, engages with the concept of dangerous ideas and censorship. The new series contrasts with the religious criticism and banning campaigns that his original 'His Dark Materials' trilogy faced. The analysis delves into Pullman's literary response to C.S. Lewis's 'Chronicles of Narnia' and connects his themes to contemporary debates over book banning. The new work is framed as a defense of telling true, embodied stories in a world threatened by post-truth relativism.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is set for arraignment in a Virginia federal court on bank fraud charges, which she has called baseless and politically motivated. The indictment alleges she misrepresented the intended use of a house she purchased in 2020 to obtain a more favorable mortgage rate. James's legal team argues the case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge, pointing to the Trump-appointed prosecutor and recent firings of career prosecutors in the office who reportedly opposed the case. The charges follow James's own successful civil fraud judgment against the Trump Organization.</p>

          <p>A court in Turkey has dismissed a corruption lawsuit against the country's main opposition party, the CHP, ruling that it lacked merit. The case had sought to nullify the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, based on allegations of vote-buying and procedural violations. The CHP has maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government to undermine the opposition using the judiciary. The ruling is seen as a move that could ease political tensions after a year-long legal crackdown on the party.</p>

          <p>Economists are divided on whether the ongoing U.S. government shutdown could push the nation into a recession. The shutdown has already caused significant hardship for furloughed federal workers, who are missing paychecks, and threatens food assistance for millions of low-income Americans. Some experts warn that a prolonged impasse could create a "vicious cycle" of diminished consumer confidence and chilled economic activity, while others argue the economy is resilient enough to withstand the disruption. The lack of reliable government economic data during the shutdown is also creating uncertainty for businesses and policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

This has led many budget-conscious shoppers to turn to more affordable non-chocolate treats.

          <p>An inquest has confirmed that Ian Watkins, the former lead singer of the rock band Lostprophets, died in prison from a stab wound to the neck. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for a series of horrific child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. The coroner's hearing was brief and has been adjourned pending the completion of a murder trial, as two men have been charged in connection with his death. The case marks a violent end for the musician whose crimes were described by the sentencing judge as plumbing "new depths of depravity."</p>

          <p>Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has announced her government's plan to increase military spending to 2% of the country's gross domestic product by March.

          <p>The FBI has broken up a sophisticated illegal poker scheme allegedly run by the mafia that used high-tech methods to cheat wealthy victims, including professional athletes, out of at least $7 million. Prosecutors described an operation that employed devices like X-ray tables to read cards, rigged shuffling machines, and special contact lenses to see pre-marked decks. The sprawling investigation led to over 30 arrests, including members of several notorious crime families and sports figures like NBA coach Chauncey Billups, who were allegedly enlisted to lure targets into the fixed games.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its regional carrier Horizon Air have resumed flights after a significant IT outage forced a system-wide ground stop across the United States. The airline announced that its systems were restored late Thursday night, but the disruption resulted in over 229 flight cancellations.

          <p>This article consults nuclear policy experts to evaluate the accuracy of the new film "A House of Dynamite," which depicts the U.S. government's response to an inbound nuclear missile. The experts generally praised the film's realistic portrayal of command-and-control procedures, such as the emergency video conference and the presidential "football." However, they questioned the plausibility of the inciting incident—a single, surprise missile launch—arguing that a real-world nuclear conflict is more likely to escalate from a conventional crisis. They concluded the film is a valuable, if dramatized, reminder of nuclear dangers.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent FBI arrests of NBA figures in connection with an illegal gambling and game-fixing investigation are the predictable outcome of the league's deep financial ties to the betting industry. The author contends that by embedding gambling promotions and odds into its broadcasts, the NBA has created a culture that compromises the game's integrity and encourages viewing athletes as mere financial instruments.

          <p>According to High Court documents, Prince Andrew was paid £60,500 in late 2019 by a businessman connected to SVS Securities, a wealth management firm that collapsed after being sanctioned by regulators for mis-selling high-risk investments to pension savers. The payment, which came shortly after Andrew withdrew from public life, has renewed scrutiny of his opaque personal finances. The same businessman's company was also reportedly used as a conduit for other controversial payments to Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, raising further questions about his judgment and financial dealings.</p>
