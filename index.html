          <p>A group of migrants from various countries are currently stuck in Djibouti due to a legal battle over their deportations. President Trump confirmed that these migrants were en route to South Sudan, a location previously classified in court. A federal judge in Boston found the deportations violated an order requiring immigrants to receive reasonable notice before being deported to a country not their own. The judge directed the administration to provide the deported men the opportunity to contest their removal from the United States on the ground in Djibouti. Trump criticized the judge's decision, expressing frustration over court losses on immigration matters.</p>

This move follows previous aggressions, including frozen grants and gutted research funding. International students contribute significantly to the university's revenue and diversity. Students and faculty express fear and confusion, with some considering transferring to other universities. The action is viewed as a blatant attack on the student body and a threat to the university's mission.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is leveraging the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) database to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students.

Harvard could challenge the SEVIS termination in court, arguing the action is retaliatory and violates the law. The university's legal challenge would likely assert that the Homeland Security secretary's actions are arbitrary and capricious.</p>
