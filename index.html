        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell stated that while demand for AI computing power is currently "tremendous," the proliferation of AI data centers will eventually reach a saturation point, though no signs of this are evident yet. His company's server networking business saw significant growth, up 58% last year, fueled by the evolving needs of large language models and customers like xAI and CoreWeave. Dell highlighted energy supply as a critical constraint, with major tech firms investing billions but facing challenges in securing adequate power for these massive facilities. The article suggests that despite engineering efforts for energy efficiency, the sheer scale of AI infrastructure will ultimately require massive energy consumption that may not be readily available, posing a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has assigned two assistant U.S. attorneys from North Carolina to the high-profile case against former FBI Director James Comey, ahead of his arraignment in Virginia. Comey was indicted last month on charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 Senate testimony on the FBI's Russia investigation. Sources suggest the newly installed U.S. attorney, a Trump appointee, struggled to find internal support for the prosecution within her office. This development follows public demands from President Trump for immediate action to bring prosecutions against Comey and other political adversaries, raising questions about political influence.</p>

Governor Kotek reiterated her stance that there is no insurrection in Oregon and ordered the demobilization of Oregon and California National Guard troops deployed to protect federal property. This move came after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order halting the deployment, affirming Kotek's position.

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order requiring immigration officials to release Bayron Rovidio Marin, who was held for 37 days in a hospital, at times shackled to his bed, without charges. Marin was recuperating from severe leg injuries sustained during an encounter with agents at a Carson car wash they raided. The judge found no proof of law violation or flight risk, and ICE had not initiated removal proceedings or issued an arrest warrant, citing clear constitutional violations.

          <p>As the government shutdown enters its second week, approximately 750,000 furloughed federal workers are facing severe financial strain and "desperation." Many are resorting to drastic measures like holding garage sales, dipping into savings, and cutting essential expenses to cope with lost income. President Trump's hint at potentially denying back pay added to the uncertainty, though senators from both parties quickly expressed support for compensation. This article highlights the widespread personal and financial hardships impacting federal employees and their families due to the ongoing political impasse.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming fourth plenum of the Central Committee is expected to see the highest turnover of members in eight years, primarily due to ongoing corruption investigations and some officials' deaths. This plenum, one of seven typically held during a five-year term, will focus on outlining the next five-year plan. Three members were already replaced at the previous plenum, including former foreign minister Qin Gang, who remains under criminal investigation but still a party member.

          <p>An analysis indicates some erosion of support within Donald Trump's 2024 voter coalition, particularly among Hispanic/Latino Americans and young people. While an overwhelming majority of Republicans and conservatives still back him, economic perceptions are identified as the biggest risk to this alliance. These voters, who initially supported Trump due to dissatisfaction with the status quo and economic conditions, are now expressing disapproval as the economy remains a concern. The article suggests this shift is more a reaction to underlying economic conditions and a desire for change, rather than a direct political statement against Trump himself.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging Colorado's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, brought by Christian counselor Kaley Chiles. Chiles argues the law unconstitutionally censors her speech in therapy sessions, while the state contends it regulates professional conduct to protect minors from harmful practices. Justices questioned Colorado's interpretation of the law, with some, like Justice Alito and Kagan, raising concerns about potential viewpoint discrimination if certain goals are favored over others. A decision is expected by early July, which could have significant implications for state regulations of mental health professionals and free speech.</p>

          <p>A psychology expert suggests that true happiness stems from contentment rather than material wealth, outlining five rules for a more satisfied life. The article emphasizes appreciating the ordinary, understanding that the happiest individuals are the most content, and recognizing that desiring what you lack fuels unhappiness. It also highlights how low expectations can create "psychological wealth," citing an example of a grandmother-in-law who was content despite living on little money. Ultimately, happiness is defined as the state where nothing is missing, irrespective of one's lifestyle, focusing on the gap between expectations and circumstances.</p>

          <p>Tesla has launched more affordable versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, with the Model Y standard variant priced just under $40,000 and the Model 3 starting around $37,000. This strategic move aims to attract buyers following the expiration of $7,500 federal EV tax credits and intense global competition. The new Model Y standard offers a 321-mile range but lacks some premium features found in higher-end versions. The article notes investor disappointment, as many hoped for updates on other new products or even lower prices, leading to a dip in Tesla's stock.</p>

          <p>The UK's most senior prosecutor, Stephen Parkinson, revealed that a spy case against two men accused of working for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence designating China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's portrayal of Portland as a "battlefield" is a manufactured spectacle, contrasting his rhetoric with the reality of peaceful protests. The author, a former CNN journalist, describes a small, diverse group of protesters facing militarized federal agents, perceiving it as a performance of power rather than a genuine threat to order. The article criticizes Trump for using "theater" to create a narrative of chaos, weaponizing federal forces against citizens, and warns against the normalization of authoritarian tactics.

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that inhalers, particularly metered-dose inhalers, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to over 530,000 gas-powered cars annually.
