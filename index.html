          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan. By leaving Texas, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum needed to conduct business, effectively stalling the bill. This action dramatically escalates the political standoff, with Abbott vowing to compel the lawmakers' return to the Capitol to proceed with the vote.</p>

          <p>A medium-security state prison in Norco, California, is scheduled to close by the fall of 2026, a decision driven by the state's declining inmate population and a desire for cost savings. The closure is expected to save California $150 million annually and reflects a broader trend of criminal justice reforms. Local officials in Norco are hopeful that the property, which was originally a luxury resort before becoming a prison, can be redeveloped to boost the local economy.</p>

Disney will distribute RedZone, the popular channel that continuously updates fans on the slate of Sunday contests.\n\nThe NFL Network also has the rights to seven regular season games — giving ESPN a larger slice of television’s top ratings draw.\n\nThe arrangement comes two years after Disney began evaluating options to maximize ESPN amid the fast-changing television landscape. The Burbank giant did not have to look much further than its most dominant programming partner.\n\nIn addition to the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN are also entering into a second non-binding agreement, under which the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property to be used by NFL Network and other assets. ESPN now owns the RedZone trademark and can use it for other sports.\n\nThe deal is a big win for ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, who took over the Disney unit in 2018 with a mandate to improve the company’s relationship with the NFL.\n\nThe equity stake comes ahead of ESPN’s move into the direct-to-consumer streaming business this fall, which gives consumers the opportunity to purchase the company’s sports channels without a cable or satellite TV subscription. NFL Network will also be available on the streaming service.\n\n“This is an exciting day for sports fans,” Pitaro said Tuesday in a statement. “By combining these NFL media assets with ESPN’s reach and innovation, we’re creating a premier destination for football fans. Together, ESPN and the NFL are redefining how fans engage with the game — anytime, anywhere. This deal helps fuel ESPN’s digital future, laying the foundation for an even more robust offering as we prepare to launch our new direct-to-consumer service.”\n\nThe new product is aimed at recapturing sports fans who are forgoing cable and satellite services. ESPN has seen its reach in cable decline from 98 million homes in 2013 to around 72 million as a result of cord-cutting.\n\n“Today’s announcement paves the way for the world’s leading sports media brand and America’s most popular sport to deliver an even more compelling experience for NFL fans, in a way that only ESPN and Disney can,” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement.\n\nESPN has the broadcast rights to “Monday Night Football” and two Super Bowl games in the current NFL contract that runs through 2033 but is expected to be reopened in 2029.\n\nThe NFL also recognized that millions of consumers no longer pay for cable channel bundles, which has cut into the distribution of the NFL Network. The deal with ESPN will provide the league with another potent conduit to reach its fans.\n\n“Since its launch in 2003, NFL Network has provided millions of fans unprecedented access to the sport they love,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “The Network’s sale to ESPN will build on this remarkable legacy, providing more NFL football for more fans in new and innovative ways.”\n\nThe deal with Disney means the NFL’s other partners — Fox, NBC, CBS, YouTube and Amazon — will be bidding against an entity that the league has a financial interest in the next time that media rights come up.\n\nLachlan Murdoch, executive chairman of Fox Corp., told Wall Street analysts Tuesday he is not concerned the NFL’s partnership with ESPN will impact his network’s standing with the league.\n\n“We have a tremendous relationship with the NFL,” Murdoch said. “We appreciate that they are fans of the broadcast and cable networks, and we look forward to working with them and deepening our relationship with them as we move forward.”</p>

          <p>U.S. border officials have been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban, according to Department of Homeland Security sources. The directive follows a federal appeals court ruling which found that the policy could not be used to completely suspend other humanitarian protections under U.S. law. This decision effectively reopens pathways for migrants to request asylum and other forms of protection, a right that the administration's policy had largely eliminated.</p>
