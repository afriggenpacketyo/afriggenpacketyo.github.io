          <p>George Simion, a hard-right nationalist, won the most votes in Romania's presidential election rerun, securing 40.5% of the vote. He will face pro-EU Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan in a runoff on May 18. Simion, an ally of Calin Georgescu, opposes military aid to Ukraine and is critical of European Union leadership. The original vote was canceled due to concerns over Russian interference, and Simion aligns himself with Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement.</p>
