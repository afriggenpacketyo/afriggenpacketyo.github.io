          <h2>Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs on Foreign-Made Films Amid Trade Disputes</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the US, citing concerns that other countries' incentives are harming the American film industry. He described this as a "National Security threat" due to "messaging and propaganda". Trump has appointed film stars as special ambassadors to promote Hollywood and bring business back to America. This action is part of Trump's broader trade policies, which include tariffs on goods from China and other countries, leading to economic uncertainty and retaliatory measures. China has already reduced its quota of American films allowed into the country in response to US tariffs. The US movie industry has been impacted by the fallout from Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, signaling a desire for policy stability amidst global macroeconomic uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell, reversing previous gains. The Australian dollar saw a slight appreciation against the US dollar. Meanwhile, other Asian markets were closed for holidays, and oil prices dropped following OPEC+'s decision to increase production. The New Taiwanese dollar continued to strengthen, appreciating 3.14% against the greenback to 29.741, hitting its strongest level in nearly three years.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is striving to redirect exports originally destined for the U.S. to its domestic market, a move that could exacerbate deflationary pressures in the country. This shift is driven by high tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the U.S. government. E-commerce giants like JD.com and Tencent are promoting sales of these redirected goods to Chinese consumers, offering significant discounts. Economists warn that this influx of discounted goods could erode company profitability and negatively impact employment, further weakening consumer demand. Deflation in wholesale prices is expected to deepen, and consumer price index is expected to fall to 0%.</p>

The trend reflects a resurgence in people seeking third spaces for socializing outside of drinking or dating environments.

          <p>Experts are debating the impact of artificial intelligence on workplace inequality, with some fearing job displacement and the exacerbation of existing disparities. While AI is touted for increasing efficiency and productivity, concerns arise about potential job losses and ethical considerations, such as bias in AI algorithms. Some workplace leaders believe protecting employment might not be the right mindset, and that it's more about adapting employment. Companies are encouraged to equip employees with new skills to handle AI and create new employment opportunities. The rise of AI requires an "AI-first" mindset, while still keeping humans in the loop.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering imposing a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, a move that could significantly impact China's film industry. Trump argues that Hollywood is being "devastated" by the number of filmmakers and studios working overseas. If implemented, this would be the first time a Trump tariff targets services rather than manufactured goods. The proposal is framed as a national security issue, citing concerns about "messaging and propaganda". Trump's administration has increasingly used national emergencies to push through policies, an approach that has faced legal challenges.</p>

MPs argue that taxpayers are already paying significantly for a broken system that relies heavily on unpaid carers. They also emphasize that investment in social care could drive economic growth and create jobs. The government acknowledges the need for deep reform and says it has "hit the ground running" on social care.</p>

Analysts suggest that this crackdown should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. They believe that the campaign's impact on military readiness and modernization is limited, and that internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor. Recent investigations have led to the removal of key figures from their positions within the CMC and the Communist Party.</p>

The process requires carefully engineered stoves, precise chemical recipes, and Vatican firefighters on standby.

An expanded offensive raises concerns about the well-being of reservists and the safety of hostages, as well as questions about Netanyahu's long-term strategy in Gaza.

          <p>President Trump stated he doesn't know if everyone in the U.S., including non-citizens, is entitled to due process under the Constitution. He also said he doesn't know if he has to uphold the Constitution as president. These comments were made during a discussion about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran native mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. Trump indicated that the Justice Department has interpreted the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return differently, and that the decision ultimately rests with the president of El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton defended his competitive spirit and terse exchanges with the Ferrari team during the Miami Grand Prix, asserting his unwavering desire to win. He asked Ferrari to have his teammate Charles Leclerc, who was in front, switch places with him as the British driver was clearly quicker. Hamilton expressed frustration at the team's delay in making decisions, but later downplayed the significance of the exchanges. Team principal Fred Vasseur acknowledged Hamilton's frustration and affirmed the team's commitment to prioritizing Ferrari's overall performance.</p>

With more than 98 percent of the votes cast inside Romania counted, Mr. Simion was far ahead of 10 rival candidates, garnering more than 40 percent. Unlike voters in Canada and Australia who in recent elections favored parties openly opposed to Mr. Trump, Romanians, by supporting Mr. Simion, rewarded one of Europe’s most vocal admirers of the MAGA movement.</p>
