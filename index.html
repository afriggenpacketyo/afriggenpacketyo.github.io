          <p>A CNBC writer details their personal experience of having their federal student loan servicer switched to a new company, Central Research Inc., with minimal and easily missed notification. This sudden transfer caused confusion and concern, particularly when their loans were placed in an administrative forbearance without their request. Experts advise borrowers in this situation to be cautious about making payments during the transition to avoid them getting lost and to monitor their credit reports for any errors. The U.S. Department of Education's use of multiple contractors to manage its vast loan portfolio means such transfers are becoming more common for millions of borrowers.</p>

          <p>The FBI reports that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, had an apparent obsession with him, based on an analysis of his digital footprint. Investigators have found evidence that Robinson tracked Kirk's public events online and familiarized himself with the Utah Valley University campus prior to the attack. DNA evidence from the crime scene has also been linked to Robinson, who was apprehended after his father recognized him in photos and urged him to surrender. Authorities are now investigating the suspect's online communications to determine if others were aware of his intentions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, which have been steadily declining and recently hit a near one-year low, may fall further this week due to an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Lenders might preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive, especially with a rate reduction seen as a near certainty. The magnitude of the drop could be influenced by whether the Fed opts for a 25 or a more aggressive 50-basis-point cut. Prospective homebuyers are advised to monitor the market closely, as these lower rates may not last long, and to ensure their credit score is strong to qualify for the best offers.

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, developed a "leftist ideology" after dropping out of university and engaging with "deep, dark internet" culture. While a definitive motive is still under investigation, Cox pointed to evidence such as engravings on the ammunition used in the attack. The governor also noted that Robinson's romantic partner, a transgender individual, has been cooperative with the investigation, though Robinson himself is not. These details emerge as authorities hold the suspect under a "special watch" pending a mental health evaluation.</p>

The acquisition of more than 2.5 million shares is seen by the market as a strong signal of Musk's confidence in the electric vehicle maker's future. This move comes as Tesla faces challenges, including a sales decline and increased competition, and ahead of a shareholder vote on a new pay package that could make Musk the world's first trillionaire.

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor known for her work on cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice to reclaim her job. The suit alleges her termination in July by the Trump administration was "unlawful and unconstitutional," claiming she was fired without explanation solely because her father is former FBI Director James Comey or due to her perceived political beliefs. Comey is the latest of numerous DOJ employees to legally challenge their dismissals during Trump's second term. In a farewell note, she warned that such actions could instill fear and suppress independent thought within the department.</p>

A number of companies, including MSNBC, United Airlines, and Nasdaq, have fired or suspended employees for remarks that were deemed insensitive or in violation of company policy. Legal experts note that private employers generally have the right to terminate employees for public statements that could harm the company's reputation, as First Amendment protections are limited in the private sector.

          <p>An analysis by CBS News examining the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) concludes that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before considering government subsidies. The report from investment bank Lazard shows that fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, along with nuclear power, are significantly more expensive to generate. While the Trump administration is phasing out clean energy incentives and promoting fossil fuels, experts note that the high upfront capital costs of renewables are offset by extremely low long-term operating expenses, as the "fuel" is free.

          <p>With annuity sales rising, many retirees are using them for guaranteed income, but accessing the funds early can be complex. This article outlines seven strategic ways to withdraw money from an annuity, each with different financial implications. The simplest method is waiting for scheduled payments to begin, but other options include partial withdrawals (often up to 10% annually without penalty), taking a loan against the annuity's value, or surrendering the contract for a lump sum, which may incur steep fees. Other strategies involve using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a new contract, invoking hardship provisions, or selling future payments to a third party.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revived a proposal to eliminate the 55-year-old requirement for public companies to issue quarterly earnings reports, suggesting a switch to a six-month cycle instead. He argues that this change would save companies money and encourage executives to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The idea aligns with the administration's goal of reducing regulatory burdens and has been supported by some in the business community, including the Long-Term Stock Exchange.

The nomination is controversial due to Miran's past writings advocating for less Fed independence and his plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role rather than resigning if confirmed. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, express concern that this arrangement could compromise the central bank's political independence, which is designed to insulate monetary policy from partisan influence. Miran has stated he would act independently, but his dual status as a potential Fed governor and White House employee has alarmed lawmakers and watchdog groups.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a significant retrenchment is underway in mainstream media, moving away from both pro-democracy coverage and a focus on racial inequality. The author cites the recent firing of Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah as the latest example of a hostile environment for Black journalists, who were leading voices during the racial and political "reckonings" of recent years. The piece contends that major news outlets are appeasing the political right by reverting to a "both sides" model of reporting and de-emphasizing discussions of systemic racism.

Starmer defended his initial backing of Mandelson, claiming he was unaware of the emails' content at the time, but now says the messages "cut across" his government's approach to violence against women.

Even higher earners are seeing their emergency savings balances decline, likely due to the financial pressures of rising prices and inflation.

          <p>Lauren King, the mother of six-year-old Bebe King, one of three children killed in the 2024 Southport attack, delivered an emotional statement at a public inquiry, demanding accountability for those who failed her daughter. She described the attack as "preventable" and urged the inquiry to deliver "real change" so no other family has to endure a similar tragedy. The parents of the other two victims, Alice Aguiar and Elsie Dot Stancombe, also shared harrowing accounts of how their lives were shattered.

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is seeking class action status for its lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Education is unlawfully denying borrowers access to loan forgiveness. The union claims that borrowers are being harmed by significant delays and backlogs in processing applications for programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. According to court records, over a million applications for IDR plans and more than 70,000 for PSLF are currently pending. The AFT argues that at the current processing rate, borrowers may have to wait years to receive the debt relief mandated by Congress.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie has addressed the growing controversy over Israel's participation in the next Eurovision Song Contest, stating that the event "has never been about politics." Amid threats of a boycott from several other European broadcasters due to Israel's actions in Gaza, Davie said the BBC is aware of the concerns and will work with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the contest. He emphasized the importance of preserving Eurovision as a celebration of music and culture that unites people. The debate follows Spain's culture minister joining calls to exclude Israel from the 2025 competition.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison for the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run to prevent the baby from being taken into care by social services, leading to a 53-day manhunt. The infant's body was later found in a shopping bag in Brighton, with the court concluding she died of hypothermia while the couple was living in a tent. The judge noted that the couple showed "no genuine expression of remorse" and had given little thought to the baby's welfare during their attempt to live off-grid.</p>

          <p>Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK, dealing a significant blow to Tory leader Kemi Badenoch. At a press conference alongside Reform leader Nigel Farage, Kruger, who had been serving as a shadow minister, declared that the Conservative Party is "over" as a national political force. He cited the party's "failure" in government, which he said resulted in higher taxes and social decline, as his reason for leaving. The move from Kruger, a prominent Tory thinker, underscores the growing challenge Reform UK poses to the Conservative party from the right.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has reached a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining an exclusive club that includes only Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock rose more than 4% on Monday, pushing it past the milestone. The recent surge was partly fueled by a favorable outcome in an antitrust case, where the penalties imposed were less severe than investors had feared. This achievement comes about 20 years after Google's initial public offering and as the company navigates new challenges from AI competition and increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.

          <h2>Financial Experts Warn Against Common Mistakes That Increase Credit Card Debt Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 12:02:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, small mistakes can significantly increase costs for consumers. This article highlights three common errors to avoid: paying late, which incurs fees and can trigger a higher penalty APR; carrying a balance from month to month, which allows interest to compound daily; and failing to explore cost-saving strategies. Options like 0% balance transfer offers or debt consolidation loans can provide relief by lowering interest rates. Ignoring these solutions can cause debt to spiral, making it much more expensive and difficult to pay off in the long run.</p>
