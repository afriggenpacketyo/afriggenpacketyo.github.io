          <p>St. Louis' emergency management chief, Sarah Russell, has been placed on administrative leave after tornado sirens failed to activate during a deadly storm, resulting in five fatalities. Mayor Cara Spencer ordered an external investigation following the siren failure, which affected approximately 5,000 people. Russell contacted the Fire Department to activate the sirens, but the directive was deemed ambiguous, and the backup button at the Fire Department was also found to be non-functional. The city has since changed the siren activation protocol, putting the Fire Department solely in charge, and is working to repair the broken button.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Justice Department probes and proposed consent decrees with police departments in Minneapolis and Louisville, initiated under former President Biden following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon criticized the consent decrees as "years of micromanagement" by unelected bureaucrats with an anti-police agenda. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stated the city will continue implementing reforms outlined in the agreement despite the federal withdrawal. The Justice Department claims the consent decrees accused the agencies of engaging in patterns of unconstitutional policing by "wrongly equating statistical disparities with intentional discrimination and heavily relying on flawed methodologies and incomplete data."</p>

          <p>President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa had a tense exchange at the White House, with Trump confronting Ramaphosa about alleged White genocide in South Africa.

Trump played a video showing white crosses, which he claimed were burial sites of White farmers, but were actually part of a protest against all farm murders. Ramaphosa and others in his delegation pushed back, stating that crime affects all demographics in South Africa and that the videos do not represent government policy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department just before the fifth anniversary of George Floydâ€™s killing, a move met with dismay by city officials. The oversight aimed to end what federal authorities called a longstanding pattern of racist and unconstitutional practices. Minneapolis officials have vowed to continue with the reforms outlined in the agreement, despite the Trump administration's withdrawal. The Justice Department claims such agreements are ineffectual, costly, and last too long.</p>

          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's top crypto and AI advisor, anticipates the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will pass with bipartisan support. He claims the bill could unlock trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries by providing a legal framework for the already $200 billion in stablecoins. The GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, indicating strong support. Sacks did not address concerns from Democrats about safeguards preventing the president and his family from profiting from the legislation.</p>

Conservatives are pushing for deeper cuts to Medicaid and faster repeal of clean-energy tax credits, while moderates are concerned about the impact of cuts on their constituents. The speaker brought in the president yesterday morning to make what he hoped would be a final pitch to Republicans: Set aside your differences and pass the bill onto the Senate.</p>

          <p>Scientists propose a novel way of treating mosquitoes for malaria. Malaria parasites, which kill nearly 600,000 people a year, mostly children, are spread by female mosquitoes when they drink blood. Current efforts aim to kill mosquitoes with insecticide rather than curing them of malaria. But a team at Harvard University has found a pair of drugs which can successfully rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim.</p>

          <p>US researchers are proposing a novel approach to combat malaria by administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes to clear their infection and prevent them from spreading the disease. Instead of focusing on killing mosquitoes with insecticide, the team at Harvard University found two drugs that can effectively rid the insects of malaria when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with this drug cocktail, offering a new method to combat insecticide resistance. Current efforts primarily aim to kill mosquitoes, but researchers suggest this approach is no longer sufficient.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration defended its controversial tariffs before a trade court in New York, arguing that striking down the levies would "completely kneecap" the president during trade talks with China. The lawsuit challenges whether Trump's use of a "national emergency" under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) was legally justified to support the tariffs. The administration argued that the president's emergency declarations were not subject to judicial review and only Congress could intervene.</p>
