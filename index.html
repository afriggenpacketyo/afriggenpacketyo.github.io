          <p>Simon Mann, a former British Army officer and mercenary involved in a failed coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea in 2004, has died of a heart attack while exercising, according to friends. Mann, who had a history with the SAS, was arrested with fellow mercenaries after trying to load weapons onto a plane in Zimbabwe. He was sentenced to 34 years in prison on arms charges, later being pardoned and released, expressing regret for his actions and the moral implications of working in conflict zones. Mann's attempted coup was reportedly foiled by the CIA, and he served time in the notorious Black Beach Prison.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending the writ of habeas corpus to address illegal immigration. Miller argued that the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus during times of invasion. This consideration is contingent on whether the courts align with the administration's views on deporting undocumented immigrants. The concept of habeas corpus, which protects against unlawful detention, was codified in the Magna Carta.</p>

          <p>The stock market remained cautious on Friday as investors awaited the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. and China. While stocks have rebounded from a drop in early April, concerns persist about a potential slowdown in U.S. economic growth. The Trump administration is considering reducing tariffs on China, while a trade pact with the U.K. has been announced, though some analysts doubt its impact on easing global trade tensions. Uncertainty remains regarding whether the U.S.-China talks will yield significant progress.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ozturk was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March, sparking public outrage and accusations of abusing the immigration system to deport international students. Her lawyers argued that she was detained in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel, which they say is protected by the First Amendment. The judge agreed, stating there was no evidence she posed a threat and that her continued detention could deter others from exercising their First Amendment rights.</p>

Judge Susan Illston indicated that the President must seek Congressional cooperation for significant government restructuring. The lawsuit, filed by labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments, argues that the Trump administration's actions violate the Constitution by attempting to restructure the federal government without Congressional authorization.

          <p>With home equity interest rates decreasing, homeowners with a HELOC should consider strategic payoff methods. Taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest can expedite payoff and protect against future rate volatility. Monitoring the interest rate climate allows for larger payments during lower rate periods. Using the HELOC for eligible home repairs and renovations can lead to tax deductions, which can then be used to pay down the HELOC.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a recent court ruling that favored the game maker. Fortnite was removed from iPhones in 2020 after Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission system. The recent ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, potentially paving the way for Fortnite's return. Apple still has the option to reject the submission, and is appealing the ruling. This is the latest development in the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple.</p>
