          <p>The inaugural summit between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and China in Kuala Lumpur highlighted Asia's increasing geoeconomic importance and its potential as a cultural catalyst. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim emphasizes neutrality as essential for regional stability, advocating for diversified partnerships, as seen in the summit alongside the 46th Asean Summit. Asean has established strong ties with both the Gulf states and China, focusing on economic collaboration in areas like the digital economy, renewable energy, and food security, while China-Asean economic integration continues to deepen, marked by upgrades to their free-trade agreement, which underscores Asia's growing role in global affairs.</p>

          <p>The UK is expected to have a hotter-than-normal summer, increasing the likelihood of heatwaves, according to the Met Office's recent three-month outlook. Meteorological summer, spanning from June 1 to August 31 in 2025, is twice as likely to be hotter than average. This prediction follows an unprecedented spring, which was recorded as the sunniest, as well as one of the driest and warmest, on record, leading to concerns about potential impacts on agriculture and water resources.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Canada have forced the evacuation of approximately 17,000 residents in Manitoba, with over 5,000 from Flin Flon alone, as officials fear wind changes could bring the fire into the city.

Saskatchewan and Alberta are also affected, with over 8,000 evacuees and limited resources, with smoke drifting into the U.S., causing air quality alerts in the Upper Midwest.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in the upcoming Spending Review as it finalizes spending plans for various sectors including the NHS, defense, schools, and the criminal justice system. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other "unprotected" areas. While funding increased sharply in 2024 for various sectors, it is projected to slow down, with the government prioritizing reducing patient waiting times and improving access to dental care. The government aims to scrutinize every pound spent, but the IFS warns that the consequences of front-loaded spending must be confronted, as increased defense spending would require even larger cuts to other departments.

          <p>Some European companies are becoming increasingly cautious about sending employees to the U.S. due to stricter immigration checks and reports of detentions and deportations. Companies are issuing new travel guidance, such as advising employees to use wiped electronic devices or enter the U.S. via Canada, while some are encouraging online attendance at U.S. events. The heightened anxiety stems from volatile policymaking and stricter border controls, with a survey indicating that 29% of global travel buyers expect a decline in business travel volume at their companies in 2025 due to U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Orioles' Coby Mayo faced criticism for his baserunning tactic during a game against the Chicago White Sox, leading to benches clearing. After hitting a single, Mayo ran out of the baseline to avoid a tag, colliding with White Sox infielder Lenyn Sosa, resulting in an exchange of words and a shove from Mayo. The incident prompted both benches and bullpens to clear, though order was eventually restored by the umpires. Mayo defended his actions as an attempt to get into scoring position, while social media users criticized his play as "bush league."</p>

          <p>Industry insiders argue that art has an essential role in shaping environmental governance and making direct interventions to combat climate change. Contemporary art can rekindle relationships with the environment and foster care and agency, according to Markus Reymann, co-director of TBA21 Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary. Artist Maja Petric's light installations aim to evoke feelings associated with pristine nature, while historically, artists have reminded society of what might be lost, such as Turner landscapes and Constable skyscapes. Art can bridge the gap by helping people understand challenging concepts and imagine alternative futures, making the climate crisis easier to comprehend and act upon.</p>

          <p>Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after years on the political sidelines. However, the KMT faces an immediate threat from a mass-recall campaign orchestrated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which could jeopardize its legislative majority. Analysts warn that failure to contain the recall challenge could disrupt the KMT’s leadership transition, potentially fracturing the party. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has signaled his intention to step down after completing his term, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor.</p>

The IAEA has warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, raising serious concerns.

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" consisting of Coke and fries can alleviate migraine symptoms, but experts caution against relying on this as a legitimate cure. While some individuals find temporary relief from the caffeine and sugar in Coke or the salt on fries, migraines are complex neurological conditions that cannot be cured by fast food. Dr. Kay Kennis notes that caffeine can act as a nerve disruptor, but excessive caffeine can also trigger migraines, and fast food may contain migraine-inducing compounds. Neurologist Peter Goadsby advises listening to one's body and avoiding TikTok trends, as research is ongoing to develop effective migraine treatments.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience stems from his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself, which is crucial to maintaining his viability. The acronym “TACO,” meaning “Trump Always Chickens Out,” refers to the perception that Trump is always testing limits but willing to pull back, reassuring swing voters. By checking himself and being checked by others, Trump meets the expectations of an important group of voters who approve of his presidency based on this dynamic interaction. This strategy has allowed Trump to recover from potentially damaging situations and maintain a normal level of approval in a polarized country.</p>

Coogler conducted extensive research in Clarksdale, which inspired the film, and he arranged free screenings for the town's residents, who had previously lacked a movie theater.

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of an "imminent" threat from China to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war. Hegseth characterized China as seeking hegemonic power and preparing to use military force to alter Asia's power balance. China responded by accusing the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace. The U.S. aims to forge a strong deterrent with allies to prevent war, but emphasizes that deterrence is costly and requires Asian countries to upgrade their defenses.</p>
