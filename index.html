          <p>The Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into global finance. Major firms like Robinhood, which launched tokenized U.S. stocks, and Deutsche Bank are building on Ethereum's network, signaling a shift from speculative hype to practical utility. Despite market volatility, institutional investors are drawn to Ethereum's stability, security, and censorship resistance for applications like tokenized assets and stablecoins. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized that dependability, not just speed, is what attracts these large-scale partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The direct action group Palestine Action is set to be banned as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary injunction. The proscription, which takes effect at midnight, will criminalize membership or support for the group, with penalties of up to 14 years in prison. The government's decision follows actions claimed by the group, including significant damage to aircraft at an RAF base. Palestine Action's co-founder called the ban an "authoritarian abuse" of power and plans to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" will foster prosperity for both Main Street and Wall Street. The author contends the legislation builds on a "blue-collar renaissance" by making 2017 tax cuts permanent, ending taxes on tips and overtime, and funding border security to redirect wages from illegal to legal workers. The piece also highlights provisions for 100% expensing for factories and deregulation of the energy sector as key drivers for economic growth and national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>LGBTQ+ soldiers serving in the Ukrainian military are fighting a dual battle for their country's sovereignty and for equal rights at home. While many find acceptance within their units, they lack legal protections, such as the right to registered civil partnerships, which denies their partners inheritance or hospital visitation rights. Some soldiers also report facing harassment and threats, with little legal recourse. Despite these challenges and the slow progress of relevant legislation in parliament, public support for LGBTQ+ rights in Ukraine is growing, offering a glimmer of hope for these soldiers.</p>

He argues for embracing the complexity of American history, including the internal struggles of its iconic figures, as it makes the nation's story richer and more accessible to everyone.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he may spare undocumented farm workers from deportation if their employers can vouch for their long-term employment and hard work. This potential policy shift, which could also extend to hospitality workers, is reportedly being drafted with the Homeland Security Secretary. The proposal comes after the agricultural industry faced significant labor shortages and economic disruption due to the administration's aggressive deportation drive. The move suggests a possible concession to the agriculture sector, which has been heavily impacted by the fear-driven absence of its workforce.</p>

          <p>As competitive eating gains popularity, health experts detail the significant physiological stress it places on the body. A 2007 study showed a competitive eater's stomach can expand to a massive, distended sac, losing its normal ability to contract and move food. In the short term, ingesting thousands of calories and extreme levels of sodium can cause bloating, gastrointestinal distress, and dangerous spikes in blood pressure. While long-term effects are not well-studied, potential risks include permanent stomach damage, jaw arthritis, and the immediate danger of choking or tearing the esophagus.</p>

The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," underscoring how harmful stereotypes persist.

          <p>The UK government will offer compensation of up to £4,000 each to 277 Afghan nationals whose personal information was exposed in Ministry of Defence data breaches in 2021. The most significant breach occurred when an email was sent to individuals eligible for relocation, with their addresses mistakenly placed in the 'To' field instead of 'Bcc'. This error exposed the identities of people, including interpreters, who were in hiding from the Taliban. The government expects the compensation to cost around £1.6 million, in addition to a previous fine from the data watchdog.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding in central Texas, leading to disaster declarations in several counties. More than a foot of rain fell in just a few hours, causing the Guadalupe River to surge to its second-highest level on record and triggering widespread water rescues and evacuations. The Kerr County sheriff's office has confirmed fatalities, urging residents to shelter in place and move to higher ground. The intense rain on drought-hardened soil has exacerbated the runoff, creating an extremely dangerous situation across the region.</p>

          <p>An internal European Parliament audit alleges that the now-defunct far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group may have improperly spent at least €4.3 million in EU operating funds. The funds were reportedly funneled through questionable contracts and donations to organizations linked to far-right figures but unrelated to EU legislative work, which is a violation of parliamentary rules. Beneficiaries included companies tied to Marine Le Pen's allies and an Austrian newspaper close to the FPÖ. Critics argue the case highlights systemic weaknesses in the EU's financial oversight, enabling such abuses to occur.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated in a Fourth of July social media post that he feels "politically homeless" because he believes the Democratic party no longer fosters a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. A self-described "techno-capitalist," Altman argued for policies that encourage wealth creation while also ensuring its wide distribution, a balance he feels Democrats have abandoned. He expressed a preference for candidates focused on raising everyone's standard of living rather than those who advocate for eliminating billionaires. His comments came in response to a New York City mayoral candidate's recent statement against the existence of billionaires.</p>

          <p>A 90-day pause on extensive U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for consumers and businesses. If new trade agreements are not reached, tariffs announced in April, including a universal 10% duty plus country-specific rates, will take effect. While the Trump administration has announced deals with China and the U.K., the status of negotiations with dozens of other countries remains unclear. Economists warn that the implementation of these tariffs could spark inflation, harm smaller companies, and negatively impact financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new trade pact with Vietnam includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through the country, a move targeting Chinese manufacturers avoiding U.S. duties. However, the deal's lack of specific details has raised questions about its enforcement and how "made in Vietnam" will be defined. Economists note the difficulty in determining the origin of components, which could cause significant disruption if applied broadly. The pact signals the U.S. may use future trade deals to pressure other nations to limit their role in China's supply chain.</p>

          <p>Following the passage of President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," Tesla CEO Elon Musk signaled his continued opposition by endorsing Senator Rand Paul's critique of the legislation. Paul argued the bill "explodes the deficit," a concern Musk has echoed, previously calling the legislation the "DEBT SLAVERY bill." Musk's opposition has been particularly fierce, in part because the bill cuts tax credits and support for electric vehicles, directly impacting his businesses. The public feud between Musk and Trump intensified as the bill moved through Congress, contributing to volatility in Tesla's stock. (not investment advice)</p>
