          <p>Dominion Voting Systems and Rudy Giuliani have reached a confidential settlement in the $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit over Giuliani's baseless 2020 election-rigging claims. The agreement leads to the permanent dismissal of the suit against the former New York City mayor and former personal lawyer to President Trump. This settlement follows similar large payouts by Fox News and Newsmax to Dominion, underscoring the legal and financial repercussions for those who spread unproven conspiracy theories about the 2020 election results. Giuliani has faced multiple legal and financial setbacks stemming from his role in disseminating election conspiracy theories, including disbarment and significant judgments.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve received a one-game suspension and fine from the WNBA for her aggressive behavior and critical comments towards officials during and after a playoff loss to the Phoenix Mercury. The league cited her pursuit of an official, delayed court exit, inappropriate fan comments, and remarks in a post-game press conference. This incident, believed to be the first playoff suspension for a WNBA coach, highlights ongoing league-wide concerns about officiating consistency and physicality. Assistant coaches Eric Thibault and Rebekkah Brunson were also fined for related conduct and social media comments, underscoring the WNBA's stance on professional conduct.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel clarified that 274 plainclothes agents were present at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, but asserted they were deployed for crowd control *after* the riot began, a mission against FBI standards. Patel accused former Director Christopher Wray of lying to Congress by not disclosing the agents' presence when questioned. This revelation, reportedly from agents coming forward, intensifies scrutiny on the FBI's transparency and role during the events of January 6th. Former President Trump also weighed in, suggesting agents might have acted as agitators and called for a full investigation into what he termed "Dirty Cops and Crooked Politicians."</p>

          <p>Europe established a commanding 11½–4½ lead over the USA heading into the final day's Ryder Cup singles matches, needing only 2.5 more points to retain the trophy. This historic lead was achieved despite disruptive and abusive behavior from some American spectators, particularly directed at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, which drew widespread criticism. The article highlights Europe's exceptional performance, contrasting it with American capitulation and rising tensions both on and off the course, including a heated exchange between Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau. This dominant display has already made history with Europe's largest ever pre-singles lead, making Sunday's matches a mere formality for retention.</p>

          <p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland officials vehemently rejected President Trump's directive to deploy federal troops to the city, asserting there was "no need" for military presence and calling it a "threat to communities." Kotek urged residents not to "take the bait" and to protest peacefully, while Police Chief Bob Day reported no recent uptick in violent unrest, contrary to the President's claims. Trump's order, authorizing "Full Force" against "antifa and other domestic terrorists," is part of a broader administration crackdown on alleged domestic terrorism. This article emphasizes the local government's strong opposition to federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Stephany Gauffeny, pregnant wife of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, spoke out after her husband was critically injured and left on life support in a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility. Garcia-Hernandez, a Mexican national detained for DUI, was reportedly shackled in the hospital despite being unconscious, with ICE controlling access to his room. This article highlights the profound personal tragedy and calls for increased security at ICE facilities, contrasting the government's "criminal illegal aliens" label with Gauffeny's portrayal of her husband as a loving father and helpful community member.

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler experienced a historically poor performance at the Ryder Cup, losing his first four matches and becoming the first American to do so in the event's history. Despite his recent dominance in stroke-play, Scheffler's struggles highlighted how the Ryder Cup's team format and intense pressure can expose individual weaknesses, particularly his often-fragile putting. His unraveling was emblematic of the broader American defeat, as Europe secured a commanding lead. The article questions whether his detached mindset, usually an asset, becomes a liability in team competition, where collective passion and nerve are paramount.</p>

He recounts his personal evolution on issues, notably his decisive role in the gay marriage decision and his conflicted stance on abortion, emphasizing that "the cases swung, not me."

While some users report noticeable improvements in skin and hair, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about oral supplements' ability to effectively reach and impact skin cells. Collagen is a large molecule, and even hydrolyzed forms face challenges in absorption and targeted delivery within the body. Topical collagen creams are deemed ineffective for deeper skin layers. Experts ultimately recommend proven methods like sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking as more impactful for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>

          <p>Former MP George Galloway and his wife were stopped by counter-terrorism police at Gatwick Airport upon their return from Moscow via Abu Dhabi. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the stop under Schedule 3 to the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act, but stated neither was arrested and they were allowed to proceed. Galloway's Workers Party of Britain condemned the incident as "politically motivated intimidation" aimed at silencing opponents of war with Russia and China. This event raises concerns about freedom of speech and potential political targeting within the UK, particularly given Galloway's controversial political history and recent activities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan guarantee for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain following a cyber attack that halted production for weeks. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan aims to protect jobs in the automotive sector, which employs around 150,000 people across the UK. The cyber shutdown, costing JLR an estimated £50 million per week, threatened many small suppliers with collapse. This financial intervention, through the Export Development Guarantee, is intended to boost JLR's cash reserves and ensure backlog payments to suppliers, facilitating recovery from the August 31st hack.

          <p>California faces a chronic housing shortage, a point of consensus among lawmakers and experts, yet the exact scale of the deficit remains elusive, with estimates ranging from 56,000 to 3.5 million units. This article delves into why these numbers vary so widely, attributing discrepancies to differing methodologies, target vacancy rates, and definitions of "pent-up demand" or "missing households." Despite the numerical ambiguity, the consistent message is that the shortage is substantial, prompting recent legislative changes to encourage denser development. Experts suggest focusing on the sheer magnitude of the problem rather than a precise figure, emphasizing the immense work still needed.</p>

Hospitals in Gaza are on the brink of collapse due to damage and severe shortages, while aid deliveries to the north have been halted, contributing to a looming famine and widespread suffering.</p>

His remarks come as Labour aims to position itself as a patriotic alternative to Reform, which continues to poll strongly.
