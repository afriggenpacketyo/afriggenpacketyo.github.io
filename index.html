          <p>Texas House Republicans have authorized the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. Governor Greg Abbott ordered state police to locate and return the absent members, though the warrants have no legal power outside of Texas. The showdown occurred after Democrats broke quorum to block a Republican-led effort, backed by former President Trump, to redraw congressional maps in a way that could create up to five new GOP seats and help the party maintain control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>A significant decline in volunteer firefighters across the United States is placing a heavy burden on remaining crews and threatening the safety of smaller communities. The number of volunteers has dropped by over 20% in recent decades while emergency calls have tripled, forcing some towns to switch to costly paid departments. To address the shortage, which saves taxpayers billions annually, lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to encourage recruitment and prevent further strain on essential services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial over allegations that he plotted a coup. The judge cited Bolsonaro's failure to comply with previous restraining orders, including using allies' social media to encourage attacks on the judiciary. The ruling has drawn condemnation from the U.S. State Department and has been labeled a "witch-hunt" by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has used the trial as justification for imposing tariffs on some Brazilian goods.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of Bronze Age cattle, inside a cave in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The finding was part of a larger project exploring caverns near Ingleborough, which also uncovered evidence of Neolithic human burial sites. This discovery provides new insights into prehistoric life and farming practices in the region. The project highlights the crucial role of experienced cavers in accessing and identifying subterranean archaeological sites.</p>

Trump's endorsement on Truth Social celebrated the ad's success and contrasted it with what he termed "woke" advertising, contributing to a meme-driven rally for the financially challenged retailer.

          <p>A report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) indicates that Taiwan's critical energy supplies would be exhausted quickly in the event of a military blockade by China. The analysis, based on 26 war-gaming scenarios, concluded that natural gas reserves would last only 11 days, coal in seven weeks, and oil in 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States.</p>

Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its process for tracing winners, which can be difficult for those with old paper records or gifted bonds. While NS&I states it has paid over 99% of winners since 1957, consumer advocates and solicitors are calling for a more flexible and less bureaucratic system to reunite people with their winnings, especially during the current cost of living crisis.</p>

          <p>Immigration authorities are attempting to use expedited removal proceedings to deport an Arizona woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years, sparking a legal challenge. Her lawyers argue this is a test of a federal law that prohibits the removal of long-term immigrants without a court hearing. The woman, a single mother of three U.S. citizens, was placed in expedited removal after being pulled over, a process her lawyers contend is an illegal overreach of a policy intended for recent arrivals, setting a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p>Storm Floris has battered the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland, with winds exceeding 80mph, causing power outages for over 43,000 homes and significant travel disruption. The storm, the sixth of the season, led to the cancellation of planes, trains, and ferries, with weather warnings for a "threat to life" in effect. Network Rail Scotland reported an "unprecedented" situation, working to clear fallen trees and debris from routes, with disruptions expected to continue. Several events, including shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, were also canceled as a precaution.</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Atlantic argues that several events over five days constitute a significant assault on truth in governance. The article cites the removal of Trump's impeachments from a Smithsonian exhibit, the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over revised jobs data, and the investigation of prosecutor Jack Smith. The author contends these actions represent a coordinated effort to suppress factual reporting, manipulate official statistics, and rewrite the historical record for political purposes, undermining the foundations of accountable government.</p>

          <p>California is on pace for one of its most severe wildfire years, with acreage burned already far exceeding the five-year average, largely due to major fires in Central and Southern California. The Gifford fire, currently the state's largest active blaze, continues to grow amid conditions ripe for "abnormally elevated fire behavior." While Northern California has had a slower start, officials warn that vegetation is drying out, and an impending heatwave is expected to increase fire risk across the entire state's parched landscape.</p>

          <p>An ex-girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was slated to testify against him as “Victim-3” but dropped out before the trial, has written a letter to the judge advocating for his release on bail. In the letter, Virginia Huynh stated she does not view Combs as a danger and believes he has made efforts to become a better person and a committed father. This development adds a complex layer to Combs' legal situation, as his defense team continues to seek his release ahead of his October sentencing for prostitution-related convictions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that Democrats are preparing a ballot measure that would only be triggered if Texas moves forward with its own Republican-led congressional redistricting. This "cause and effect" strategy would ask California voters to approve a temporary, mid-decade redrawing of the state's own congressional map for the 2026 election. The move is a direct response to efforts in Texas to create more GOP-leaning districts, setting up a high-stakes political battle between the two states that could influence control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Korean survivors and their descendants continue to grapple with its devastating legacy of illness, disfigurement, and stigma. An estimated 20% of the initial victims were Koreans, many of whom were in Japan as forced laborers under colonial rule. Survivors who returned to Korea faced prejudice and were largely forgotten by their own government for decades. They and their children, who suffer from high rates of illness, are still fighting for official recognition and justice from Japan, the U.S., and Korea.</p>
