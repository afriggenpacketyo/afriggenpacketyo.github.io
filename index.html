          <p>Reports indicate that at least 27 people were killed and over 90 injured near a Gaza aid distribution center due to gunfire, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The IDF acknowledged a shooting incident approximately 500 meters from the aid site, stating that forces fired at suspects who approached them in a threatening manner, but details of the incident are under investigation. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which operates the aid site, claimed that distribution was conducted safely but acknowledged the IDF is investigating injuries beyond the safe corridor. The UN Secretary-General has called for an independent investigation into the incident, as previous reports have cited violence near aid distribution sites.</p>

          <p>Thames Water faces increased uncertainty after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest Â£4 billion into the company, which serves a quarter of the UK's population. This setback raises the possibility of government-supervised administration, although water services are expected to continue uninterrupted regardless of ownership. Thames Water's chairman expressed disappointment but affirmed ongoing efforts to secure a sustainable recapitalization plan with creditors and stakeholders. The company, burdened with approximately Â£19 billion in debt, is exploring alternative plans to avoid collapse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes two key mistakes made by Red Bull during the Spanish Grand Prix, beginning with the incident between Max Verstappen and George Russell in Turn One, where Red Bull ordered Verstappen to give back his position following an inquiry. Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, cited past incidents as justification, but stewards later deemed Verstappen could have kept the place. The second error was pitting Verstappen for hard tires under a safety car, a decision immediately questioned by the driver. The article delves into racing guidelines and the team's miscalculations during the race.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German police have commenced a new search in Portugal as part of the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, who vanished in 2007. The search focuses on the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz, where Madeleine disappeared, with German investigators leading the effort since identifying Christian BrÃ¼ckner as the prime suspect in 2020. BrÃ¼ckner, currently imprisoned in Germany for another crime, denies involvement, but authorities suspect him of murder despite insufficient evidence. The search, the first in two years, concentrates on the area between the Ocean Club resort and BrÃ¼ckner's former residence, with authorities planning to share any seized evidence with German officials.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of shamelessness in politics, arguing that it is a necessary survival tactic for politicians navigating shifting political landscapes. It highlights President Trump's ability to contradict himself without hesitation as a key factor in his success, contrasting it with instances where politicians like John Kerry were criticized for flip-flopping. The article suggests that voters may appreciate a leader who is willing to adapt and recalibrate, even if it means contradicting past statements, and also notes that the Democrats lack a strong national spokesperson to counter such tactics.</p>

The MIIT has vowed to enhance governance over such competition, while People's Daily described the carmaking sector as being in a "sub-healthy" state due to shrinking profit margins and overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply reduced its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to the impact of President Trump's tariff policies, forecasting only 1.6% growth this year and 1.5% in 2026. The downgrade cites the fallout from tariffs, economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown in immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. The OECD also lowered its global growth forecast, noting that the slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Frequent changes in tariff policies have created uncertainty in global markets and economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to India's heavy industries minister, Tesla is reportedly "not interested in manufacturing in India" despite the country's efforts to attract investment from global EV giants. This statement follows the Indian government's unveiling of incentives for EV manufacturing last March. While Tesla is expected to open two showrooms in India, this marks the first public acknowledgment that India has been unable to secure a manufacturing commitment from Elon Musk. The decision may stem from concerns about the maturity of the Indian EV market, charging infrastructure, and local road conditions.</p>

          <p>A guest essay in The New York Times discusses the recent presidential election in Poland, where nationalist candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly defeated liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. The election is viewed as a setback for Poland's liberals and a reminder of the resilience of populism. The author suggests that the previous two years, during which a centrist coalition attempted to reverse the effects of populist government, may have been a temporary interlude. The results highlight deep dissatisfaction and polarization among Polish voters.</p>
