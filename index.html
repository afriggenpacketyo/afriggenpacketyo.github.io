          <p>The counting of ballots has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to determine the successor to President Michael D Higgins. The two main contenders are independent politician Catherine Connolly, backed by left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, remains on the ballot despite withdrawing, and any votes for him will be transferred. Early indications suggest a low voter turnout, potentially near the record low of under 40% from the 2018 election, with the final result expected to be announced at Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations are taking place in several German cities after Chancellor Friedrich Merz made contentious comments regarding migration and the appearance of cities. Despite widespread criticism from political opponents and even coalition partners, a recent survey indicates that a majority of the public agrees with his statements. The controversy coincides with new government figures showing a significant increase in deportations in 2025 compared to the previous year. Critics argue the chancellor's language is divisive, while supporters believe he is addressing a genuine public concern.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected new talks with the U.S., asserting strength while facing diminished regional influence. Despite escalating tensions and the reinstatement of UN sanctions, experts believe Iran is managing a crisis by buying time, avoiding actions that could provoke a military strike from Israel or the U.S. While Tehran has ceased cooperation with the IAEA on inspections, it has not fully withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This calculated ambiguity suggests the regime is in a dilemma, balancing defiant rhetoric with a pragmatic desire to avoid all-out war.</p>

          <p>Social media claims that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a fact-check investigation. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like low revenue or renovations, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 markets are scheduled to proceed as planned. The viral claims appear to originate from a single, questionable article that used sensationalist language and lacked credible sources. Although security costs have risen for organizers following past attacks, there is no evidence of widespread closures across the country.</p>

A project led by the University of Glasgow is distributing 'Wintering Well' boxes through local libraries, which include therapeutic lamps to counteract the effects of low light. SAD, a type of depression linked to seasonal changes, affects over a million people in the UK with symptoms like low mood and anxiety. The initiative aims to shift attitudes towards winter by encouraging outdoor activity and creating comforting indoor light environments.</p>

          <p>In her posthumously released memoir, "Nobody's Girl," Virginia Giuffre details her experience of being sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The book recounts a brutal sexual assault by an unnamed former prime minister on Epstein's private island, which she describes as a turning point in her understanding of Epstein's cruelty. Giuffre also chronicles non-criminal encounters with powerful figures like Donald Trump, whom she met while working at Mar-a-Lago, and Bill Clinton, who she notes flew on Epstein's plane and attended dinners. The memoir provides her perspective on being drawn into and surviving their abusive network.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of manufacturing a pretext for war after the Pentagon deployed the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean. The U.S. claims the military buildup is part of its counternarcotics operations, having conducted 10 air strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels. However, President Trump has labeled Maduro the leader of a drug-trafficking organization, fueling fears in Venezuela that the deployment is a prelude to a regime-change operation. Military analysts suggest the scale of the U.S. force far exceeds what is needed for drug interdiction.</p>

          <p>Following their decisive 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series opener, questions have arisen about whether the Dodgers' week-long break after sweeping the NLCS disrupted their momentum.

Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, who had extended rests, both had difficult outings.

Beijing alleges that Hanwha supported a U.S. investigation into Chinese competitors that led to new port fees. The move targets a company that has become a symbol of U.S.-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation, particularly through its recent acquisition of a Philadelphia shipyard. This action represents another escalation in the broader economic friction between Washington and Beijing, placing a key U.S. ally in a difficult position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of donors to President Trump's $300 million White House ballroom reveals that many contributors are corporations with significant interests pending before the federal government. The list includes major tech firms like Google and Microsoft, defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, and cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase. These donations have raised conflict-of-interest concerns, as many of the companies are seeking favorable policy decisions, regulatory approval for mergers, or lucrative government contracts. The White House has dismissed the criticism, stating the project improves the "People's House" for future generations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is set to extend into another week with no resolution in sight, forcing the House of Representatives to cancel votes for the fifth consecutive week. Amid the stalemate, the Pentagon confirmed it has accepted an anonymous $130 million donation to help cover the salaries of service members who risk going without pay. President Trump revealed the donation came from a "friend of mine" and praised the donor as a patriot. Lawmakers expressed frustration over the lack of progress, with one senator describing the situation as a political game that is causing real suffering for the public.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant show of support just before early voting begins. Jeffries stated he respects the will of primary voters and Mamdani's commitment to addressing the city's affordability crisis.

His opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, recently secured the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, setting the stage for the final stretch of the campaign.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea is being viewed by experts as a symbolic and carefully planned effort to mend strained relations between the two nations. While immediate major breakthroughs are not expected, the trip signifies a potential restart for diplomacy. The visit contrasts with Xi's 2014 trip, which occurred during a high point in bilateral relations and led to a free-trade agreement. Since then, issues like denuclearization on the Korean peninsula have created distance, making this summit a critical step toward rebuilding trust and cooperation.</p>
