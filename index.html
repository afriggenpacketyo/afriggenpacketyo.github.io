          <p>Despite a potential U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits are expected to continue getting their monthly checks without interruption. This is because the program is funded through mandatory spending, which does not require annual congressional approval. However, the Social Security Administration has warned that other services, such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards, could be disrupted or halted. A prolonged shutdown could also delay the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement.</p>

          <p>During a severe storm in western Alaska, a man named Steven Anaver found himself floating for roughly a mile inside his home after it was torn from its foundation by record-high floodwaters. The remnants of Typhoon Halong caused widespread devastation, displacing over 2,000 people and resulting in at least one fatality. Anaver documented the terrifying experience from inside his drifting house, describing it as being "inches away from death" before the structure eventually came to rest. He was later rescued by neighbors once the water receded.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government facing another shutdown, this article provides a historical overview of the 14 previous funding lapses that have occurred since 1980. The practice of halting government operations during funding gaps became standard after legal opinions from the Attorney General during the Reagan administration. The article details the duration and cause of each shutdown, from brief, one-day interruptions to the 34-day partial shutdown in 2018 over border wall funding. This context highlights how shutdowns have become a more frequent and disruptive political tool over the past decade.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, certificates of deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure savings option, with top accounts offering returns that outpace the current inflation rate. This article details the national average CD yields for various terms and contrasts them with the higher rates offered by online banks, which often have lower overhead costs. It notes the current phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs provide higher interest rates than longer-term ones. The article suggests strategies like laddering CDs to maximize returns in this environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several states are alerting millions of Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that their benefits may not be distributed in November if the federal government shutdown continues. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees the program, has informed states of insufficient funds to cover the benefits and instructed them to pause processing for the upcoming month. While the USDA has contingency funds that could potentially be used, it remains unclear if the administration will choose to release them, creating uncertainty for over 40 million recipients.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown will require all active-duty U.S. military personnel to continue performing their duties without pay until Congress reaches a funding agreement. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for government employees after a shutdown, military pay requires separate legislation, which has not yet passed. Essential civilian Department of Defense personnel will also work without pay, while others will be furloughed.

Conventional mortgages from private lenders should proceed as usual, but loans insured or issued by the FHA, VA, and USDA may experience processing slowdowns due to furloughed staff. A key concern is the potential disruption to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by FEMA, which could delay closings for homes in high-risk flood zones that require federal flood insurance.</p>

This approach aims to address food insecurity for a population heavily dependent on fishing, where traditional conservation methods like protected areas have often failed due to extreme poverty.

The positive revision is also attributed to a reduced expected impact from tariffs.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that these supply chains are the result of market forces and corporate choices. The comments follow an agreement between the U.S. and Australia to boost their collaboration on critical minerals, shortly after Beijing imposed stricter export controls on rare earths, citing concerns about their potential misuse in military sectors.</p>

          <p>A potential tragedy was prevented at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport after police arrested a man whose family reported he was heading there to "shoot it up." The family alerted authorities that Billy Joe Cagle was livestreaming his intentions on social media and was armed with an assault rifle. Police located Cagle inside the terminal and found an AR-15 with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck parked outside. Officials praised the family's decision to "see something and say something," which led to the successful intervention and Cagle's arrest on multiple felony charges.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and strong winds expected to impact southern and eastern England on Thursday. A deepening low-pressure system is forecast to bring widespread rainfall of 20-50mm and wind gusts of 45-55 mph, with potential for localized flooding and transport disruption. While the impacts in the UK may not be severe enough for the Met Office to name the storm, meteorological agencies in France or Belgium might name it Storm Benjamin if conditions are more intense there. The public is advised to stay updated on the forecast due to some remaining uncertainty.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced plans to cut red tape for businesses by scrapping "needless form filling" and simplifying corporate rules. The proposed reforms, which she claims will save firms nearly £6 billion annually, include streamlining the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. The announcement comes ahead of next month's Budget and aims to boost growth and make the UK more attractive for global investment. However, business groups have expressed caution, stating the true test will be whether the government avoids raising other business taxes.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's optimistic statements about securing a "fantastic deal" with China, analysts believe a comprehensive trade agreement remains unlikely in the near term. Trump's recent conciliatory remarks, which included a desire for China to purchase more soybeans, were tempered by a simultaneous threat to impose 100% tariffs if negotiations fail. The mixed messaging comes as the U.S. signs a critical minerals deal with Australia aimed at reducing reliance on China. This complex dynamic suggests that while dialogue continues, significant hurdles and uncertainty still define the U.S.-China trade relationship.</p>

          <p>A national energy assistance group warns that the U.S. government shutdown and mass layoffs could cause unprecedented delays in distributing aid from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap). This threatens to leave millions of vulnerable households without critical funds as heating bills are expected to rise this winter. The program, which helps nearly 6 million families, is already chronically underfunded, and the recent firing of its entire staff has left no one to process the allocations. Advocates are urging utility companies to suspend disconnections for overdue bills until the federal funding is released.</p>

          <p>Rural economies in the U.S. Midwest that depend on the multi-billion dollar deer hunting industry are facing a significant threat from infectious diseases like Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) and Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD). Landowners and hunters in states like Ohio are reporting a sharp increase in deer deaths, leading to widespread cancellations of hunting trips and substantial financial losses. Experts suggest that climate change, with warmer temperatures and drought conditions, may be exacerbating the spread of these diseases by concentrating deer at fewer water sources, raising concerns for local economies.</p>
