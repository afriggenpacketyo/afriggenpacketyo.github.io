          <p>Recent protests and unrest in Los Angeles have temporarily united factions within the Trump right, who were previously divided on issues like trade. The unifying factor is a shared belief that progressives and left-wing activists pose an existential threat to the United States. This sentiment is rooted in a narrative drawn from the events of 2020, which conservatives view as a culmination of Covid restrictions, calls for social change, and street upheaval. The right sees Trump as the best defense against a repeat of what they consider the excesses and dangers of modern progressive politics.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police made mass arrests as protesters defied an overnight curfew imposed after days of demonstrations against President Trump's immigration policies and military deployment. The curfew, covering a square mile area of downtown LA, aimed to curb protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). California Governor Gavin Newsom filed an emergency request to block the Trump administration from using military forces to assist ICE. Trump has deployed thousands of National Guard members and Marines to LA, citing the need to quell protests, while Newsom condemned the targeting of immigrant families and the militarization of the city.</p>

          <p>Young Angelenos who participated in the docuseries "Social Studies" shared their perspectives on cellphone bans and Instagram age limits. They noted that while adults often react with horror to the depiction of online life, teenagers find it relatable and even humorous. The participants supported the Los Angeles Unified School District's cellphone ban, emphasizing that it works best when it applies to everyone. They also suggested raising the minimum age for joining Instagram, with some advocating for age 16 or older to allow for the development of critical thinking skills.</p>

          <p>A California law aimed at reducing greenhouse gases by diverting organic waste from landfills is exacerbating illegal dumping in the Antelope Valley. The law requires residents and businesses to separate food waste and yard trimmings, but the Los Angeles area lacks the infrastructure to process the increased organic waste. This has led to waste haulers illegally dumping unprocessed mulch, often containing invasive plant species and toxic herbicides, on desert land. Residents and officials are concerned about the lasting damage to the fragile desert ecosystem and the impact on air quality.</p>

          <p>The rise in unnatural heat waves due to climate change raises the question of responsibility for resulting deaths, with some arguing that fossil fuel companies should be held accountable. A wrongful-death suit has been filed in Seattle, alleging that fossil fuel companies failed to warn the public about the dangers of planet-warming emissions. Criminal homicide prosecutions of corporate actors are part of US history, and if fossil fuel companies knowingly created lethal climate harms, homicide charges may be appropriate. Public opinion seems to favor judicial action, with a majority believing fossil fuel companies should be held legally accountable for contributing to climate change.</p>

          <p>Changes proposed under President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" could undermine Obamacare enrollment and coverage, potentially causing millions to lose coverage by 2034. The bill includes provisions that would end automatic re-enrollment, require more documentation for tax credits, shorten the open enrollment period, and eliminate a special enrollment period for lower-income individuals. Additionally, enhanced tax credits created during the pandemic are set to expire, which would further increase premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
