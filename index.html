        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, in collaboration with Florida law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 undocumented immigrants in a statewide operation. The operation, initiated on Monday, primarily targeted individuals with existing deportation orders, leading to over 275 arrests. This initiative marks the first formal collaboration with state law enforcement under a 287(g) agreement, reflecting the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to accelerate deportations. The arrests have sparked debate regarding immigration policies and the role of state and federal cooperation in enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Animal rights groups are advocating for the relocation of two killer whales, Wikie and Keijo, from the closed Marineland Antibes zoo in France to a sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada. The French government is considering options after Spanish authorities blocked a transfer to Loro Parque in Tenerife due to inadequate facilities. While Marineland emphasizes the urgency of moving the whales to an operational destination, activists argue for a sanctuary environment where they can have more space and freedom from breeding or performance demands. The Whale Sanctuary Project has proposed a site in Port Hilford Bay, aiming to provide a more natural habitat for the orcas.</p>

The camp's notoriety stemmed from the chilling accounts of journalists and soldiers, as well as the intact evidence of atrocities.

          <p>New polls indicate that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump across a range of key issues. A majority of those surveyed described the president's second term as “scary”. The polls show poor ratings on the economy and Trump’s immigration policy. They also indicate that a minority of Americans believe Trump has focussed on the right priorities as president. The results suggest a decline in Trump's popularity and growing dissatisfaction with his leadership.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attendance at Pope Francis's funeral led to a potential shift in his perspective on Russia's intentions in Ukraine. After a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump expressed doubts about Vladimir Putin's desire for peace. The meeting, and Trump's subsequent comments, could signal a change in U.S. policy toward the conflict. However, Trump's mercurial nature leaves the future direction of U.S.-Ukraine relations uncertain.</p>
