Senate Republicans utilized the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority, to advance the legislation. In response, Democrats forced votes on an unlimited number of amendments to put their colleagues on the record regarding controversial provisions, as GOP leaders worked to secure the necessary votes from within their own party before a July 4 deadline.</p>

          <p>The private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI for China unexpectedly rose to 50.4 in June, indicating a return to growth, particularly among export-oriented firms. This result diverged from China's official government PMI, which showed a third straight month of contraction for the manufacturing sector. Analysts noted the Caixin reading was supported by increased production and promotional activities, though new export orders continued to decline and employment in the sector remained weak due to cautious hiring.

          <p>Two tropical systems are currently impacting Mexico, with Tropical Storm Flossie strengthening into a hurricane off the country's southwestern Pacific coast. While Flossie is expected to remain over open water, it is forecast to bring heavy rainfall to several coastal states. Meanwhile, on Mexico's eastern coast, former Tropical Storm Barry made landfall as a tropical depression and was rapidly weakening as it moved inland, though it still poses a threat of significant localized flooding from heavy rain.</p>
