          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in contraction territory for the third straight month in June, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. Despite a slight improvement to 49.7 from May's 49.5, the figure still falls below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The data reflects ongoing challenges for manufacturers, including a domestic supply glut, sluggish consumer demand, and a deepening price war. These economic headwinds persist despite Beijing's stimulus efforts and ongoing deflationary pressures that have troubled the sector for over two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least two firefighters were killed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being targeted by sniper fire while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. According to the Kootenai County Sheriff, first responders were under active fire from a suspect using high-powered rifles, creating an extremely dangerous and dynamic situation. The incident has prompted a large-scale law enforcement response involving local, state, and federal agencies, with authorities working to neutralize the shooter and rescue civilians still on the mountain.

          <p>As the U.S. Senate began debate on a major legislative package championed by President Trump, a new analysis from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projected it would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The report also estimated that the bill would lead to significant losses in healthcare coverage, further complicating its path forward. Despite the fiscal concerns, President Trump has been actively pressuring Republican lawmakers to support the bill ahead of a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The legislation's future remains uncertain amid internal party divisions and strong Democratic opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The arrest of two elementary school teachers in Japan for taking and sharing indecent photos of female students has raised significant alarm about child safety in schools. The educators allegedly used a private social media group with other teachers to circulate voyeuristic images, including some reportedly taken with a school camera. This case has prompted widespread concern among parents and the public, highlighting systemic issues and the challenges of protecting children from trusted authority figures.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, a growing number of passengers are reporting experiences of motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now examining. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a primary cause. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, creates low-frequency deceleration that can induce nausea and discomfort. Researchers are exploring solutions to mitigate this effect and improve the passenger experience as the automotive industry continues its transition to electric power.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came just hours after President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The rift occurred after Tillis opposed the president's major tax and spending bill, citing concerns over its deep cuts to Medicaid that would negatively impact his state. In his announcement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating that the political environment has become increasingly hostile to independent thinking. His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a historically Republican state.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" but not "total damage" on Iran's nuclear capabilities. His assessment suggests that while the program was significantly set back, Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to rebuild if it chooses to do so. Grossi's comments contrast with more absolute statements from U.S. officials who claimed the facilities were "obliterated."

Nearly 46,000 care home residents died with Covid in England and Wales, and the inquiry will scrutinize the government's claim of having thrown a "protective ring" around these facilities.

Despite a heavy police presence designed to prevent large gatherings, activists carrying rainbow flags clashed with officers in the city center.

          <p>Pride Month celebrations around the world, from New York City to Budapest, have been marked by a dual spirit of joyful celebration and determined protest. While participants waved rainbow flags to celebrate LGBTQ+ identity, many also carried signs denouncing increasing political attacks and discriminatory policies in the U.S. and abroad. In New York, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," commemorating the Stonewall Riots legacy. Meanwhile, in Hungary, tens of thousands marched in defiance of a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, highlighting the ongoing global struggle for equality and inclusion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is pledging focused action to combat a significant rise in attacks against religious institutions, which one official described as a form of terrorism. FBI data indicates that assaults at churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023. The department is prioritizing these cases, securing lengthy prison sentences for individuals convicted of planning or carrying out such attacks. This increased focus comes as religious communities across the country enhance their own security measures in response to the growing wave of threats, often driven by white nationalism or other extremist ideologies.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has called for reforms to the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), warning that some savers may get less money out than they originally invested. LISAs, designed for first-time home buyers or retirement savings, offer a 25% government bonus but impose a steep penalty for early withdrawals. This penalty means individuals facing unforeseen circumstances could lose 6.25% of their own contributions. The Treasury Committee's report also criticized the product's complexity and noted that its rules could unfairly penalize individuals who are also eligible for certain government benefits.

          <p>According to a new assessment by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a major budget bill backed by President Trump could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage. The report also projects that the legislation would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, largely due to deep cuts in healthcare funding for programs like Medicaid. These stark figures have become a major flashpoint as the bill faces a difficult path in the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority and face unified Democratic opposition.

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a U.S. expert on Chinese law at the University of Pennsylvania, believes that historical precedent offers hope for the future of U.S.-China relations. Reflecting on a recent trip to China with students, he noted that the current period of disruption feels similar to the post-1989 era, after which student and scholarly exchanges eventually resumed and flourished. While acknowledging the immense changes in China over the past 30 years, Mahboubi suggests that the underlying potential for connection and dialogue can help the relationship survive the current rupture between the two global powers.</p>
