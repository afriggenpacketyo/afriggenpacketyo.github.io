          <p>Israel's military has announced the death of Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, in a targeted airstrike in Gaza City. The operation, a joint effort by the IDF and Shin Bet, was based on prior intelligence identifying his location in the al-Rimal neighborhood. Hamas has not yet confirmed the death, which comes as Israel prepares for a broader offensive into the city. The strike also resulted in civilian casualties, according to local reports, amidst a worsening humanitarian crisis with famine conditions confirmed in the area.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, supporting an estimated 4,000 UK jobs and strengthening NATO's northern maritime capabilities. This strategic partnership aims to create a combined fleet to counter Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic. The deal was secured over competing bids from France, Germany, and the United States, marking a significant win for the British defense industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is offering 24 months of free credit monitoring to those affected. Security researchers have linked the attack methodology to the extortion group known as ShinyHunters.</p>

This achievement adds a unique bookend to his career, as he was also the second-youngest scorer back in 2002 with Leeds United. The goal marked his first in six years and highlighted his remarkable longevity and fitness in top-flight football. Teammates and pundits praised Milner's experience and character, calling him a "legend of the game" for his sustained high-level performance.</p>

The flotilla aims to deliver essential supplies such as food and medicine to the Palestinian territory, where experts have warned of famine conditions. Organizers state the mission is a response to Israel's ongoing violations of international law by preventing aid from reaching the besieged strip.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting 10 unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The ruling came after advocacy groups argued the planned removals would violate U.S. laws that provide specific protections for vulnerable children arriving at the border without guardians. The administration had recently established an agreement with Guatemala to facilitate such deportations. The judge's 14-day order blocks the immediate transfer of the children, aged 10 to 17, to immigration enforcement for removal.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK in 2025. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the infection during her pregnancy, a measure highly recommended to provide passive immunity to newborns. This tragic event highlights growing concerns over declining vaccine uptake for childhood diseases, with none of the main vaccines meeting the 95% target needed for herd immunity last year. Health officials are urging pregnant women and parents of young children to ensure their vaccinations are up to date to prevent further severe cases.</p>

          <p>This article explores the difficult situation of being laid off months before qualifying for retirement benefits, a scenario that can jeopardize a lifetime of financial planning. It details the potential loss of pensions, vested 401(k) matches, and subsidized health coverage, which often far outweighs the value of a severance package. While federal law prohibits firing an employee solely to prevent them from collecting retirement benefits, proving such intent can be challenging. The article advises individuals to carefully calculate the total value of their lost benefits before accepting a severance offer that requires them to waive their right to sue.

Moore defended his state's progress on crime while calling the president's comments cynical and his actions "performative."

          <p>Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor, expressed concern over the recent ouster of the CDC director and other top officials, warning it creates a dangerous leadership vacuum. She argued that this turmoil directly affects public health, as critical vaccine policy is now being dictated by "political fiat" rather than a transparent scientific process. This has led to confusion about insurance coverage and vaccine recommendations for COVID-19, RSV, and Hepatitis B. Gounder highlighted that upcoming advisory meetings may see an unprecedented revisiting of long-standing childhood vaccine schedules, driven by politics instead of science.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a forgettable 0-0 draw, a result that highlighted the struggles of both teams. Rangers, under manager Russell Martin, showed improved defensive resilience and fight, which was seen as a small positive amid their worst league start since 1983. In contrast, Celtic's performance was described as "powder-puff," with the team failing to create any significant scoring opportunities and looking creatively bankrupt in attack. The lackluster match puts pressure on both managers, particularly Celtic's Brendan Rodgers, to improve their squads before the transfer window closes.</p>

The urchin population had exploded due to an ecological imbalance, creating "urchin barrens" where kelp could not grow. With the urchins cleared, the kelp has returned rapidly, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species and demonstrating a successful model for ecosystem recovery.</p>

Calling the ruling "weaponized partisan injustice," Navarro warned that if the decision is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The court found that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the broad tariffs.

          <p>CBS News is mourning the loss of veteran correspondent Mark Knoller, a revered figure in the Washington press corps for over three decades.

          <p>Swimming advisories have been issued for beaches across the United States for the Labor Day weekend due to unsafe levels of fecal bacteria in the water. Destinations from Florida to Maine and California are affected, with health officials warning that the contamination can cause gastrointestinal illnesses and rashes. A recent report from Environment America found that 61% of U.S. beaches tested had at least one day of potentially unsafe water quality in the past year. The contamination is often caused by polluted runoff, failing sewer systems, and industrial livestock operations, highlighting ongoing challenges with water infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. companies, including Walmart and J.M. Smucker, are warning that President Trump's tariffs are leading to higher prices on store shelves for groceries, electronics, and other goods. Executives state that as they replenish their inventory at higher post-tariff costs, the price increases passed on to consumers will likely accelerate in the coming months. This pressure is causing a shift in consumer behavior, with many shoppers opting for lower-priced brands or shopping at discount retailers. The situation remains uncertain following a recent court ruling that found most of the tariffs illegal, a decision the administration is appealing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned any potential plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling it an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about such a plan but argued that the president has ulterior motives beyond fighting crime, suggesting it could be a move to disrupt future elections. The comments come after President Trump criticized Chicago as a "mess" and hinted at federal intervention, similar to actions taken in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The White House responded by calling Pritzker "weak and pathetic" for deflecting from the city's crime crisis.</p>

The protest was intended to highlight the Spanish government's alleged "complicity" in the devastating summer wildfires that have ravaged the country. The group claims that a majority of the fires are linked to the livestock industry and that insufficient action is being taken to address the climate emergency.

          <p>An investigation into heat-related fatalities in Arizona reveals the deadly danger of indoor heat, particularly for low-income and medically vulnerable residents when air conditioning fails. The article details the case of Richard Chamblee, 52, who died just two days after his home's AC broke during a 115°F heatwave because his family could not afford immediate repairs. In Maricopa County, nearly a quarter of all heat deaths occurred indoors, with most victims having a broken AC unit. Experts warn these preventable deaths could surge due to rising energy costs and insufficient social safety nets.</p>

Rhian Boxall was looking after Tilly, her brother's dog, who was only expected to have about six puppies but ended up giving birth to fourteen over a 15-hour period. With the dog's owner on holiday abroad, Boxall and her family managed the delivery, successfully saving twelve of the pups, including one born outside that required warming with a hairdryer.
