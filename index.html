          <p>Elon Musk publicly criticized NASA administrator Sean Duffy, asserting he is not smart enough for the role, following NASA's decision to consider lunar lander proposals from companies other than SpaceX. Musk, on X, accused Duffy of "trying to kill NASA," despite SpaceX holding a $2.9 billion contract for the Artemis III mission. NASA aims to return astronauts to the moon before China, and Duffy emphasized not waiting for a single company. Musk defended SpaceX's pace, predicting Starship will ultimately complete the entire moon mission, while Duffy welcomed the competition as beneficial for American innovation.</p>

          <p>Demolition has commenced on the White House's East Wing to make way for President Trump's privately funded ballroom addition, despite his earlier assurances it wouldn't interfere with the existing structure. The project, costing $250 million, is fully funded by private contributions and aims to significantly increase capacity for official functions. However, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and other architectural groups have expressed deep concerns that the proposed 90,000-square-foot annex will overwhelm the White House's classical design and disrupt its balanced appearance. They urge a pause for public review processes, highlighting the controversy surrounding this major architectural change.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports in September ended a four-month decline, increasing 4.2% year-on-year, primarily driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, particularly mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to drop by 13.3%, despite a trade deal that reduced tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a key growth driver, rising 12.6%. Analysts noted the rebound was partly due to a low base from the previous year, with concerns remaining about U.S.-China trade tensions. The yen's weakness under the new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's policies is expected to further benefit exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) will close Terminal 5 on October 28 for a complete demolition and overhaul, part of a $30-billion renovation project in preparation for the 2028 Olympics. This extensive modernization aims to deliver a new terminal and improved airport experience, building on previous reshuffling and renovation efforts. Airlines previously housed in Terminal 5, including JetBlue, Spirit, and American, are being relocated to other terminals. The opening of the new Midfield Satellite Concourse South will help maintain operations during construction, which is expected to conclude just before the Olympic games.</p>

          <p>The National Guard's deployment in Washington, D.C., could be extended through summer 2026, according to recent court filings and internal emails. Brig. Gen. Leland Blanchard II advised officers to "plan and prepare for a long-term persistent presence," citing the America 250th anniversary celebration in 2026 as a factor. Currently, 2,400 Guardsmen from D.C. and eight states are deputized as federal law enforcement. The District of Columbia's attorney general alleges that this federalization violates the U.S. Constitution by overriding local authority, with the Pentagon exercising pervasive control over the troops.</p>

This perspective is underscored by insights from Nobel laureates, suggesting that policies like the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and immigration could undermine innovation. The article also highlights how large tech corporations can stifle competition through acquisitions and lobbying, which, according to mathematical modeling by Aghion and Howitt, ultimately hinders economic growth and creative destruction essential for progress.

          <p>North Korea test-fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday, detected by South Korea's military flying approximately 350 kilometers eastward from near Pyongyang. Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi confirmed no missiles reached Japanese waters, and no damage was reported. This launch occurs ahead of a planned visit to South Korea by U.S. President Donald Trump for an APEC summit, dampening hopes for improved inter-Korean relations. The test marks the first since South Korean President Lee Jae-myung took office, who has advocated for dialogue despite North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's continued weapons tests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy criticized Democrats, calling the ongoing government shutdown a "'Seinfeld' shutdown because it's a shutdown about nothing." He argued that Democrats are declining to pass a "clean" continuing resolution to keep the government open, instead pushing for extensions to health insurance subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid restrictions. McCarthy contrasted this with the 2013 shutdown, where Republicans sought policy changes. He suggested Democrats are "trying to find a message" and are "fearful" of their rank-and-file, highlighting increased political division and mutual blame in current funding impasses.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner expressed optimism about the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas peace plan, despite recent violence, calling the progress "better than expected." Two more hostage bodies were returned to Israel, bringing the total deceased identified to 15, alongside 20 living hostages released. Vance urged patience for the return of all remains, acknowledging difficulties in locating bodies. While Netanyahu affirmed commitment to peace, some Israeli critics remain skeptical of his long-term intentions, fearing a resumption of military operations.

          <p>The UK government announced new proposals to make fining English water companies for raw sewage spills "quicker and easier," aiming to give the Environment Agency stronger enforcement powers. The plans include automatic fines up to £20,000 for minor offenses and a reduced burden of proof for more serious ones, potentially leading to fines up to £500,000 without court proceedings. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds expects the system to raise £50-£67 million annually, with costs borne by shareholders, not customers.

          <p>Gold prices suffered their worst single-day drop in 12 years on Tuesday, falling as much as 6.3%, prompting billionaire investor Bill Gross to suggest the precious metal is behaving more like a "meme stock." Gross, known as the "Bond King," attributed gold's volatility and recent surge partly to hype and speculation, making it vulnerable to sharp declines. He noted gold remains sensitive to short-term interest rates and has been buoyed by central bank buying due to "policy uncertainty." While Gross believes gold will "hold up better than stocks" in the coming weeks, he anticipates a potential price pullback. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, stressing that healthy hair stems from fundamental care, not expensive products or complex routines. They clarify that cold water doesn't add shine, and no product can repair damaged hair or split ends, which only a haircut can fix. Furthermore, the concept of "self-cleaning" hair is dismissed, as regular washing is crucial for scalp health to prevent oil and bacteria buildup. Experts advise against using dry shampoo as a daily substitute for washing, recommending it only once between washes to avoid scalp issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to broker peace in Ukraine have stalled, contrasting with his recent success in securing a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release. The article analyzes that Trump possessed greater leverage with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu due to his strong pro-Israel stance and political ties in the region. In Ukraine, however, Trump's influence is diminished, having fluctuated between pressuring Putin and Zelensky without significant effect. Putin, it is suggested, may be leveraging Trump's desire for a deal to influence U.S. policy, making a resolution more elusive for the U.S. president.</p>
