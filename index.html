          <p>Constellation Brands has significantly reduced its fiscal year guidance, citing a challenging economic environment that is dampening consumer demand. The maker of Modelo and Corona beer reported a notable deceleration in sales, particularly among Hispanic consumers, who constitute a large portion of their customer base. The company's stock fell over 6% following the announcement, which also included a lowered forecast for net beer sales and free cash flow. This revision reflects broader trends of volatile consumer purchasing behavior and the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported beer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new cryptocurrency token, WLFI, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, has nominally increased the family's wealth by approximately $5 billion. Despite the token's value dropping nearly 50% from its peak shortly after its debut, the family's large holdings account for the substantial valuation on paper. The venture has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, though the White House has dismissed these claims. The token provides holders with governance rights, but its founders' holdings are currently locked and cannot be sold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite national attention on its gun violence, Chicago is experiencing a dramatic downturn in violent crime, with robberies down by a third compared to last year. The city is on pace to record its lowest murder rate in over a decade, challenging the narrative of it being a "killing field." While violence remains concentrated in specific neighborhoods, tourist areas have generally been safe. The article suggests that while gun crime is decreasing, other forms of street crime, such as theft, may still pose a risk to visitors.</p>

The annual pass allows for unlimited flights for a penny plus taxes and fees, with certain restrictions and blackout dates. This year's pass is valid for 20 months, the longest travel window offered since the program's inception, a move industry experts see as an attempt to capture market share from struggling budget competitors. The pass allows for domestic flight bookings one day before departure and international flights ten days prior.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration will ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn a federal appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the authority to impose tariffs is a power vested exclusively in Congress. Trump argued that the tariffs are essential for the nation's financial stability and claimed the stock market was down due to the ruling. If the decision is upheld, it would nullify duties on nearly 70% of U.S. imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over the Labor Day weekend, Chicago recorded 37 separate shooting incidents that resulted in eight deaths and 50 injuries, according to police data. The violence occurred despite a general downward trend in homicides and shootings in the city for the year. This specific weekend's events have drawn national attention amid the Trump administration's threats to deploy federal forces to the city to address crime. In response, Chicago's mayor signed an executive order to prevent city departments from collaborating with what he termed "federal overreach."</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a strike on a boat originating from Venezuela that was allegedly carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean Sea.

This military engagement occurs amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela. The strike follows a recent U.S. Navy deployment near Venezuela as part of a broader anti-drug cartel mission in the region.</p>

The decisive loss raises questions about the team's preparation and the demanding schedule, which saw some players arriving just a day before the match after competing in The Hundred tournament.

The author points to examples like the executive order on flag-burning and the levying of tariffs, suggesting these moves are designed for political theater and to project strength, not to create durable policy. The column posits that Trump avoids working through Congress, which would make his policies more permanent, because it would make him appear weak.

          <p>This article explains the distinction between two common strategies for managing debt: debt consolidation loans and debt consolidation programs. A debt consolidation loan involves taking out a new loan, typically with a lower interest rate, to pay off multiple existing debts, simplifying payments into a single monthly bill. In contrast, a debt consolidation program is a service offered by a debt relief company that helps a consumer obtain such a loan and manages the repayment process. The best option depends on an individual's credit score and financial situation, with direct loans often being better for those with good credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back customers who have cut back on spending due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The promotion includes deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. This move comes after the company's CEO acknowledged a double-digit decline in traffic from low-income consumers and sluggish breakfast sales. The focus on value is part of a broader strategy to remain competitive as consumers become more price-sensitive, a trend affecting various sectors including the beverage industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts should avoid several key mistakes this month. Financial experts advise against shopping around for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their rates, making it crucial to lock in a high rate quickly. Savers should also actively monitor the rate climate and avoid letting existing CDs automatically roll over upon maturity, as the new rates will likely be lower. Instead, they should have a plan to reinvest or transfer the funds to maximize their returns in a changing interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details three ways retirees could potentially lose or see a reduction in their Social Security benefits. The first is by working while claiming benefits before reaching full retirement age, which can trigger temporary reductions if earnings exceed a certain limit. Second, benefits can be garnished to pay for federal debts like taxes or student loans, and up to 85% of benefits can be subject to income tax depending on one's total income. Finally, changes in eligibility, such as a divorced spouse remarrying before age 60, can also impact the amount received.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie has filed a discharge petition in an attempt to force a full House vote on legislation compelling the Department of Justice to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Democrat Ro Khanna, would require the release of the documents within 30 days. The move seeks to bypass House leadership, which has scheduled a vote on a different bill directing the Oversight Committee to continue its investigation, a measure Massie criticized as a tactic to provide political cover for members who oppose the release.</p>

          <p>As lawmakers return to Washington, they have only 14 legislative days to pass a funding bill and prevent a government shutdown at the end of the month. A short-term continuing resolution is expected, but crafting a bipartisan deal is complicated by deep divisions over spending levels and policy. Democrats have denounced Republican proposals for significant cuts to health, education, and science programs. The situation is further strained by the White House's recent "pocket rescission" of foreign aid, which Democrats have called an unconstitutional overreach of executive power.</p>

This is the latest in a series of rare grand jury rebukes against cases brought by the U.S. Attorney's office following the administration's law enforcement surge in the capital. The woman's attorney argued the evidence was weak, and legal experts speculate that residents serving on grand juries may be protesting what they perceive as federal overreach.</p>

Trump sought to remove Cook for "cause" based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which the economists argue is a politically motivated move to influence monetary policy. The signatories emphasized their support for Cook and the institutional safeguards that protect the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>
