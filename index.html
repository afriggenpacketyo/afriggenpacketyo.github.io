          <p>A shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas resulted in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, noting the gunman, who died by a self-inflicted wound, left anti-ICE messages on shell casings. This event follows other recent security threats at ICE facilities in Texas, prompting the Department of Homeland Security to increase security nationwide and officials to condemn the escalating rhetoric and violence against federal law enforcement.</p>

Fact-checkers have debunked these rumors, citing extensive scientific research confirming the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, but deep-seated vaccine mistrust in the country poses a significant challenge to public health efforts.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, former attorneys for Donald Trump. The lawsuits accused Giuliani and Powell of spreading damaging falsehoods about Dominion's voting machines following the 2020 presidential election. The terms of both settlements are confidential, bringing an end to the high-profile legal battles that began in January 2021. The cases were central to the legal fallout from unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has found that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol by eating fermented fruit. Researchers observed chimpanzees in Uganda and the Ivory Coast consuming the equivalent of a small bottle of beer for a human each day. This behavior, documented across different primate groups, suggests that alcohol consumption is not a uniquely human cultural trait and may have deep evolutionary roots. The findings support the idea that the use of ethanol has long played a role in primate, and subsequently human, societies.</p>

          <p>The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been running on emergency diesel generators for five consecutive days, raising significant safety concerns. The plant, Europe's largest, lost its external power connection after its final line was severed, marking the tenth such incident since the 2022 invasion and increasing the risk of a nuclear accident. Concurrently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a new $90 billion arms agreement with the United States to bolster his country's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sharply criticized Reform UK, stating their policies "will tear this country apart" ahead of the Labour Party conference. Starmer highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as particularly "shocking," arguing it would affect people who have long contributed to British society. He positioned the Labour conference as an opportunity to present an alternative of "patriotic national renewal" against what he described as Reform's politics of "toxic divide and decline."</p>

          <p>Market strategist David Zervos has warned that the rapid growth of artificial intelligence could pose a significant problem for the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. He suggests a scenario where AI drives strong economic growth while simultaneously causing a rise in unemployment as millions of jobs are displaced over the next few years. This would create a dilemma for the Fed, forcing it to navigate an economy with robust GDP but a weakening labor market, challenging its traditional policy responses to inflation and employment.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that an Israeli-supplied Patriot air defense system has been operational in Ukraine for the past month. He also announced that two more Patriot systems are expected to arrive this fall. The development is notable given Israel's historically cautious stance on providing military aid to Ukraine, as it has tried to balance its relationship with Russia. This move suggests a potential shift in Israel's position as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly summoned hundreds of senior U.S. military generals and admirals from around the world to a meeting in Virginia, an unusual move that has stirred unease within the armed forces.

Despite the amicable statement, BYD's shares have fallen amid signs of slowing growth, including a recent cut to its 2025 sales target and its first quarterly profit decline in over three years.

          <p>Strong consumer spending, powered by the "wealth effect" from a rising stock market, appears to be keeping the U.S. economy from a recession despite a weak jobs picture. However, this reliance on market performance creates a significant vulnerability. Since the top 10% of earners own 87% of the market, the economic benefits are not widely shared, and overall consumer sentiment remains low. Economists warn that if the stock market were to decline, the subsequent drop in spending could quickly push the economy into a recession. (not investment advice)</p>
