          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone bombardment on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, just before a scheduled discussion between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, signaling a show of force as Trump pushes for a cease-fire. The article reports that the drone barrage, consisting of an estimated 273 drones and decoys, resulted in one death and several injuries. President Zelensky met with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome, reinforcing efforts to demonstrate unity and negotiate a lasting peace. The Trump administration's approach to the war has faced criticism for pressuring Ukraine and offering concessions to Moscow.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated extensive ground operations in both northern and southern Gaza, aiming to pressure Hamas amid ongoing cease-fire negotiations. Simultaneously, Israel announced it would permit a limited amount of food to enter Gaza, reversing a 10-week blockade prompted by attempts to secure an extension of a previous cease-fire deal. This decision follows mounting international concern, including pressure from President Trump, about a potential famine in Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu's office cited an ‚Äúoperational need‚Äù for the military expansion as the reason for resuming aid, though details on distribution remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is characterized by a high Gleason score, indicating its aggressive nature, but appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. The article also notes that the diagnosis has resurfaced questions about Biden's health and fitness for office, particularly in light of a recently released audio recording revealing his fragile voice and difficulty recalling details.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick disclosed that he spent $5,000 on special milk to keep Tom Brady and Antonio Brown's relationship positive during Brown's brief tenure with the New England Patriots. Brown had ordered the expensive milk for Brady, who is very nutrition-oriented, but it spoiled due to a mix-up in the mailroom. Belichick approved the expense to avoid damaging the relationship between the two players, who later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick is now head football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

Trzaskowski, a member of Tusk's Civic Platform, will face Karol Nowrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, in a runoff election. While the Polish presidency is largely ceremonial, it holds veto powers that can significantly impact the government's agenda, making the election a key test of Tusk's ability to dismantle the legacy of the Law and Justice party.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is reviewing Trump v CASA, a case that challenges the interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. The central issue is whether the amendment's promise of citizenship to 'all persons born or naturalized' in America extends to children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa-holders. President Trump issued an executive order asserting that the clause was never intended to apply to this group. This case could redefine American citizenship and judicial power.</p>

          <p>Ukraine claims Russia launched its biggest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began, targeting several regions including Kyiv, where one woman died. The barrage came just a day before a scheduled call between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 273 drones by 08:00 Sunday (05:00 GMT) targeting the central Kyiv region, and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east. The strikes killed one person in Obukhiv district in the Kyiv region, and injured at least three others - one of whom was a four-year-old child - officials reported.</p>
