          <p>Data released Thursday revealed a contraction of 0.3% in the UK economy during April, following a 0.2% growth in March. This decline is attributed to the introduction of global trade tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump and domestic tax increases, creating uncertainty for businesses. Industrial production and services output experienced significant drops, while construction output saw growth, according to the Office for National Statistics. The UK was subjected to a 10% "reciprocal tariff" from the U.S., despite having a relatively balanced trading relationship, though it has since struck a trade deal with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Changes in toilet habits can be indicators of underlying health issues, and it's important to consult a doctor if these changes persist. Experts recommend seeking medical advice for major changes in stool, blood in the stool, changes in urine, frequent or infrequent urination, mucus in the stool, and pain or straining during bowel movements. It is important to be aware of one's baseline 'normal' and to seek medical attention if deviations from that baseline occur, as early detection can lead to better outcomes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles to address protests against immigration sweeps has raised significant legal questions and prompted a challenge from California. Governor Gavin Newsom argues that the deployment is unnecessary and illegal, as the situation does not warrant the use of federal troops. Legal experts are debating whether Trump has the authority to mobilize the military on U.S. soil under the invoked statute, Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code. California seeks emergency relief, claiming Trump inflamed the protests by sending in the military when it was not necessary.</p>

          <p>High-level talks between the United States and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program are set to resume in Oman on Sunday.

Critics argue that this strategy bypasses the legal system and denies individuals a fair opportunity to present their case. The new policy aims to streamline cases and expedite deportations, aligning with the Trump administration's goal of removing people without legal status from the U.S.</p>
