            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) traveled to El Salvador to investigate the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, who was erroneously deported during the Trump administration. Van Hollen aimed to meet with Abrego Garcia, who remains detained despite court orders for his return to the U.S., and to pressure both the U.S. and El Salvadoran governments. The White House criticized Van Hollen's trip, alleging Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, a claim disputed by Abrego Garcia's family and attorneys, and not substantiated in court. The Supreme Court has ruled that Abrego Garcia's deportation was illegal, but the El Salvadoran government has not released him.</p>

            <p>Thirty-six members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews have publicly condemned Israel's government for the "heartbreaking war" in Gaza. The letter, published in the Financial Times, stated that they "cannot turn a blind eye or remain silent" at the "renewed loss of life and livelihoods" as a result of Israel's renewed offensive. The Board of Deputies acknowledged the diversity of opinion within its membership, noting that others would emphasize Hamas's responsibility for the situation. The condemnation reflects growing concern among some British Jews about the ongoing conflict.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on a Chinese refinery, shipping companies, and vessels for allegedly facilitating Iranian oil exports. The Treasury Department designated Shandong Shenxing Chemical Co Ltd for purchasing over $1 billion worth of Iranian crude oil. These actions are part of the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign to curtail Iran's energy-dominated economy. The sanctioned entities are accused of using ship-to-ship transfers to conceal Iran's petroleum deliveries to China.</p>
