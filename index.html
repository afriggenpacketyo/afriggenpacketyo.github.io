          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, impacting over 8,000 individuals who had work permits and deportation reprieves due to unsafe conditions in Afghanistan. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem cited an improved security situation and stabilizing economy in Afghanistan as reasons for the decision, reversing the Biden administration's extension of the program following the Taliban's 2021 takeover. Advocates have criticized the move, while the Trump administration is also challenging a court halt to its rollback of TPS for Venezuelans, arguing it was based on negative stereotypes.</p>

          <p>Following a historic election loss, Australia's Liberal Party has appointed Sussan Ley as its first female leader, succeeding Peter Dutton. Ley, a moderate, won by a narrow margin over Angus Taylor, who campaigned on restoring conservative values. This leadership change comes after the Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the May 3rd election, attributed to divisive leaders and policies that alienated women and younger voters. Ley aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, acknowledging the need to respect and represent modern Australia. </p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic led to flight delays of up to seven hours. The FAA stated that at least three controllers were scheduled each hour, but sources indicated that only one or two fully certified controllers were on duty during peak times. This staffing crisis is the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark, including recent radar outages caused by software and hardware issues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for mishandling the relocation of air traffic control from Long Island to Philadelphia and announced plans to reduce flights at the airport to mitigate delays.</p>

          <p>A Democratic National Committee panel has recommended redoing the election of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta as party vice-chairs due to alleged violations of the party's charter during the February vote. The resolution, prompted by a challenge from Kalyn Free, argues that the DNC improperly combined questions, giving male candidates an advantage. This development coincides with controversy surrounding Hogg's efforts to primary some Democratic politicians, leading to calls for neutrality among DNC officers. Hogg contends that the re-vote is an attempt to remove him due to his reform efforts within the party.</p>

          <p>Professor Ralph Keeling warns that proposed cuts by the Trump administration threaten NOAA's global CO2 program, potentially ending decades of critical scientific research. The program, initiated by Keeling's father, has been monitoring CO2 levels since the 1960s, providing crucial data on climate change. Eliminating funding would halt the collection of CO2 samples and degrade the nation's ability to project future climate impacts. Keeling compares this to "turning off the headlights on a dark street at night," emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring. </p>

While gold is considered a safe haven asset, its price is not immune to fluctuations, and past surges have been followed by significant falls. Central banks' increasing gold reserves and fears of the weaponization of the dollar system are also contributing to the demand.
