          <p>A man inside the Larne Leisure Centre in County Antrim recounted the fear experienced by customers and staff during an attack by rioters, who set the building on fire. Northern Ireland Assembly Member Danny Donnelly reported that families and children were using the centre for swimming and classes when youths targeted it, also providing emergency shelter for families fleeing violence in Ballymena. A brick was thrown through a window during a yoga class, causing members to flee, and windows were systematically smashed, with paint thrown over fire doors, leading staff to evacuate through the back. The PSNI is facing a crisis due to underfunding, exacerbating the challenges of responding to the unrest, while Councillor Andrew Clark expressed shock and dismay at the destruction of a community facility. The article details further incidents of disorder in other towns, including attacks on officers and disruptions to transportation. </p>

          <p>Oil prices have spiked amid geopolitical concerns as President Trump has taken a more negative stance on nuclear talks with Iran and announced the withdrawal of some U.S. personnel from the Middle East. The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of troops and non-essential staff from embassies in Baghdad, Kuwait, and Bahrain, citing potential dangers. Trump accused Tehran of delaying negotiations, while Iran's defense minister warned of military retaliation if talks fail, threatening U.S. bases in the region. The IAEA Board of Governors has declared Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations, marking a significant shift after previous rounds of positive discussions, highlighting the risk of military conflict between the U.S. or Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years. The motion, submitted by the US, UK, France, and Germany, highlights Iran's failures to provide full answers about its undeclared nuclear material and activities, expressing concern about Iran's enriched uranium stockpile. Iran has condemned the resolution as political and announced plans to open a new enrichment facility. The IAEA report criticized Iran's lack of cooperation and noted that it has enough uranium enriched to 60% purity, nearing weapons grade, to potentially make nine nuclear bombs, though Iran insists its nuclear activities are peaceful.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Toronto, Canada, suggests that following a low-calorie diet may lead to negative mental health effects, including depressive symptoms. Researchers analyzed nearly 29,000 adults and found that those on calorie-restrictive diets, even overweight individuals, experienced an increase in depressive symptom severity. Nutrient-restricted diets showed an even larger increase in symptoms, while men on any diet reported higher somatic symptom scores. While weight loss is about calories in and calories out, it’s also about the type of calories and what we need for fuel, protection against disease, and mental and physical satisfaction.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a resurgence in uranium mining due to skyrocketing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. Despite being the world's largest producer of nuclear power, the U.S. imports over 95% of its uranium, creating a policy incongruence. The Biden administration banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion to expand domestic enrichment capacity, while President Trump signed executive orders to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will continue to rely on other countries for uranium due to limited reserves.</p>

          <p>Two police officers who defended the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, attack have filed a federal civil lawsuit seeking a court order to hang a plaque honoring police heroes. The lawsuit cites a 2022 law requiring the plaque's installation by March 2023, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to doing so. The officers argue that the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution, noting that Congress has honored the man who inspired the violence while neglecting to honor those who defended the Capitol. The plaque remains in storage, fueling disputes over Trump's pardons of Capitol riot defendants and the lack of Republican statements commemorating the assault's four-year mark.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to a lower-than-expected 2.82% in May, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. This year-on-year headline inflation is the lowest since February 2019, falling below Reuters' median poll estimate of 3%. Food inflation, a key metric, dropped to 0.99% in May, significantly below April's 1.78%, with vegetable inflation dipping by 13.7%. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, recently slashing its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A skier died in an avalanche on Alaska's Mount McKinley, just days after a climber fell 3,000 feet to his death on the same peak. Nicholas Vizzini, 29, of Washington state, and his snowboarding partner triggered the avalanche while descending a slope, with the avalanche running from approximately 16,600 feet down to 15,000 feet. Mountaineering rangers responded, but Vizzini was pronounced dead at the scene, while his partner sustained minor injuries. Earlier in the month, Alex Chiu died from a 3,000-foot fall on the mountain's West Buttress climbing route, highlighting the dangers of the climbing season, which typically runs from early May to early July.</p>

          <p>Some parents are actively trying to delay their daughters' first periods due to concerns about the trend of earlier menarche and associated health risks. The average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier, from 12.5 between 1950 and 1969 to 11.9 between 2000 and 2005. Parents are making changes to diet, personal care products, and screen time, focusing on eliminating chemicals called endocrine disruptors, which can mimic the activity of hormones in the body. Experts say limiting exposure to endocrine disruptors is reasonable, but it's impossible to avoid them completely, and some worry about unintended consequences like eating disorders.</p>
