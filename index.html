          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 17:44:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A confidential United Nations nuclear watchdog report indicates that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, marking a significant increase since February. The report raises concerns as Iran remains the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, with approximately 92.5 pounds of 60% enriched uranium theoretically sufficient to produce an atomic bomb if enriched further to 90%. The IAEA urges Iran to cooperate fully with investigations into uranium traces discovered at undeclared nuclear sites, while Israel views the report as a clear warning sign of Iran's determination to complete its nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment, part of the Strategic Defence Review, aims to create an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up. The initiative will also support the production of over 7,000 British-built long-range weapons, including drones and missiles, creating approximately 1,800 new jobs. Defense Secretary John Healey emphasized that a strong defense industry is crucial for national security, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the link between a strong economy and national defense.</p>

A senior Hamas official indicated the need for amendments, particularly regarding U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli forces withdrawal. Despite this, the U.N.

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), an ambitious reforestation initiative, is under scrutiny due to satellite data and field reports indicating potential deforestation within program sites. An analysis of satellite imagery suggests that some NGP land has experienced deforestation, with native trees being cleared to make way for cash crops. The program's effectiveness is further questioned due to limited community support, poor site selection, and inadequate long-term sustainability planning, raising concerns about potential "greenwashing" practices. These issues highlight the challenges in achieving genuine reforestation and sustainable land management.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), launched in 2011, aimed to address deforestation by planting 1.8 billion seedlings over 2 million hectares. However, an analysis of satellite images suggests that some NGP land has experienced deforestation, with native trees cleared to grow cash crops. Communities often have short-term access to the land and are required to grow single cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods. The program also faces issues such as poor site selection, limited community support, and weak long-term sustainability planning, raising concerns about "greenwashing."</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to close the area and advise the public to stay away. The incident occurred early Friday morning, and beekeepers worked to recover the hives and re-hive the bees. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee. By morning, most bees were expected to return to their hives, with those responsible for their delivery taking charge.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing severe drought conditions this spring, with rainfall at a historic low and soil dryness posing significant challenges for agriculture and ecosystems. The lack of precipitation has led to increased wildfire risk, low water levels in the Rhine River, and potential price increases for consumers. Experts warn that the dryness is particularly concerning for groundwater recharge and the health of plants, which are experiencing drought stress early in the season. The situation underscores the growing impact of climate change on water resources and the need for sustainable water management strategies.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has voiced his disapproval of a new regulation concerning front wing flexibility at the Spanish Grand Prix, labeling it a "waste of money." The FIA introduced a stricter load test to limit the extent to which teams could manipulate front wing movement for aerodynamic benefits. Hamilton contends that the rule change has had minimal impact, as wings still exhibit bending, and teams were compelled to invest in new wings, suggesting the funds could have been better allocated to charitable causes. The FIA has opted not to comment on Hamilton's remarks.</p>

          <p>The classic New York City bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich is facing the pressures of inflation, with bodegas like El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn raising prices for the first time since 2019. The rising cost of eggs, bacon, and other ingredients has forced owners to increase the sandwich price to $5, up from $4.50. Despite the increase, bodegas struggle to compete with larger supermarkets due to their inability to buy in bulk. Bodegas like El Vacilon, however, remain a staple of New York City culture, serving as both convenience stores and delis.</p>
