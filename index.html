          <p>Electric vehicle maker Lucid Group has revised its full-year production forecast downward, now expecting to produce between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles. This adjustment follows second-quarter financial results that fell short of Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, with a reported net loss of $855 million. The company is grappling with slower-than-expected demand for EVs and is focusing on cost management as it prepares for the launch of its Gravity SUV. The news prompted a more than 6% drop in Lucid's stock during after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock increased by nearly 8% after the software analytics firm reported its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, surpassing analyst forecasts. The company attributed its strong performance to high demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and raised its full-year revenue guidance. U.S. commercial revenue nearly doubled, and government revenue also saw significant growth, leading to a net income jump of 144% compared to the previous year. Despite the impressive results, some analysts remain cautious about the company's high valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase fell over 6% after the company announced a private offering of $2 billion in convertible senior notes. The decline comes amid a broader market downturn and follows a period of significant volatility for the stock, which is now down more than 30% from a record high set in July. Despite recent legislative momentum for the crypto industry, shares have been falling since the passage of the GENIUS Act. The company's recent second-quarter revenue report also disappointed investors, contributing to the downward pressure on its stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Key Considerations for Homeowners Before Borrowing Against Home Equity</h2>

          <p>This article advises homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to ask critical questions before borrowing, especially with amounts as large as $100,000. While HELOCs offer lower interest rates compared to credit cards, their variable rates mean payments could change with market conditions. Homeowners should assess the likelihood and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which may not translate to immediate, substantial savings. The article also suggests comparing the flexibility of a HELOC against the stability of a fixed-rate home equity loan to determine the best fit for their financial situation.

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her case, arguing it would violate her due process rights while her conviction appeal is pending.

The filing also noted that the grand jury did not hear directly from any alleged victims, only from two law enforcement officers.

It also caps the value of the deduction for those in the highest tax bracket.

The northern and southern sections of the reef were the most affected, prompting warnings that the ecosystem may be approaching a tipping point where it can no longer recover between catastrophic events, facing a highly volatile future.</p>

          <p>Over 240 supporters of ousted Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan were arrested during nationwide rallies marking the second anniversary of his detention. The protests, organized by his PTI party to call for his release, were met with a strong police response, including tear gas in cities like Karachi. A government ban on gatherings was imposed to counter the demonstrations. Khan, who is serving sentences on multiple convictions he claims are politically motivated, had urged his followers to protest peacefully for the restoration of democracy.</p>

          <p>An unusual agreement has been reached in President Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, where Murdoch will provide regular, sworn updates on his health to postpone his deposition. Trump's lawyers had sought an expedited deposition, citing the 94-year-old media mogul's age and potential health issues. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein. This deal postpones discovery in the case until a judge rules on the defendants' motion to dismiss, highlighting a strange turn in the relationship between the president and the head of the supportive Fox News network.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments on potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair have influenced prediction markets, with Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh emerging as frontrunners. In a CNBC interview, Trump spoke favorably of "both Kevins," leading to their chances on the Kalshi prediction market rising to 35% each. The speculation comes as Trump continues to criticize current Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates high. The recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler also gives Trump an opportunity to appoint a new board member who could later be elevated to the top position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, total U.S. credit card balances rose to $1.21 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, matching the all-time high set last year. The report also highlighted elevated delinquency rates, particularly among subprime borrowers, suggesting that some consumers have overextended themselves amid higher living costs. While many cardholders pay their balances in full, a significant portion carries debt at high interest rates, indicating growing financial strain for some households. This trend points to a widening "K-shaped" split in consumer financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

Data shows a decline in their public activities compared to previous years. The analysis suggests that with the administration aggressively pursuing policies like mass deportations, which align with the groups' own goals, there is less need for them to act independently.

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs economist, the labor market impact of generative AI is already visible, starting with a hiring pullback in the technology sector that disproportionately affects younger employees. While most companies have not yet fully deployed AI, unemployment rates for tech workers aged 20-30 have jumped significantly this year. The analysis suggests that as AI handles more routine tasks, companies are slowing down the hiring of junior staff. This trend offers the first concrete evidence of AI-related job displacement, a phenomenon expected to grow in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

Witnesses reported that Black, who also suffered from dementia and other health issues, appeared to be in pain shortly after the execution began.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that a segment of the pro-Israel right is shifting the definition of anti-Semitism to encompass legitimate criticism of Israeli government policy, thereby weakening the fight against genuine Jew-hatred. The author cites examples where critics of Israel, including Jewish Senator Bernie Sanders, have been accused of "blood libel," a term for a medieval anti-Semitic canard. The article contends that this rhetorical strategy, which resembles illiberal tactics from the left, provides cover for actual anti-Semites on the far-right who support Israel for their own reasons. This ultimately devalues the charge of anti-Semitism and harms the Jewish community.</p>
