          <p>President Trump has directed an investigation into the Biden administration's alleged use of an autopen to sign presidential documents, including pardons. Trump claims this was a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and questions the legality of executive actions signed via autopen. The investigation aims to determine if Biden's aides deceived the public about his mental state and unconstitutionally exercised presidential authorities. Previous legal contributors have stated that Trump cannot revoke his predecessor's pardons, even if an autopen was used, but Trump continues to allege that Biden's use of an autopen could be illegitimate.</p>

          <p>Marissa Rothenberger, a transgender pitcher, propelled Champlin Park Rebels to the Minnesota High School Girls' Softball State Championship. Rothenberger pitched a complete game and contributed two doubles in the semifinal victory. However, the win sparked controversy, with some parents from the opposing team expressing frustration over the fairness of allowing a transgender athlete to compete against cisgender female athletes. The Minnesota State High School League permits student-athletes to compete in events consistent with their gender identity, regardless of biological sex, which is a policy that some parents feel is unfair to their daughters.</p>

The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, has been notified of the alleged violation.

Research indicates that specific beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. The study analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years, finding that babies with B. longum were significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. The researchers suggest this discovery could lead to new therapies aimed at boosting beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

The order halts work on the onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review or public process. The ruling forces Sable to postpone its restart timeline, now targeting August 1, 2025, for first sales.</p>

The review follows concerns about the drug's safety, fueled by a report from a right-wing advocacy group. Experts argue that concerns about mifepristone's safety are misguided, citing the FDA's initial approval in 2000 and subsequent reviews that have not found new safety concerns. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge to the availability of mifepristone in 2024, preserving access to the drug.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, wrongfully deported to Mexico, has been brought back to the U.S. following a judge's order. The Trump administration obeyed the judge's instructions, a significant departure from its stance in other immigration matters. The man, identified as OCG, had expressed fears of persecution in Mexico. The Department of Justice admitted that its claim that OCG had not expressed fear of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information.</p>
