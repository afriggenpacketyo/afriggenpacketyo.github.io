          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded without a clear direction as investors anticipated a key monetary policy decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve, where an interest rate cut is expected. While Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight increase, markets in Australia and South Korea declined. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose, boosted by a surge in Baidu's shares following the company's new AI-focused collaborations and a successful bond offering. The varied performance reflects regional economic data and global uncertainty pending the Fed's announcement.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche described determining the credibility of Ghislaine Maxwell as an "impossible question" following his two-day interview with her in July. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, largely repeated her denials of involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. Blanche stated that the purpose of the interview was not to pressure-test her answers but to provide her an opportunity to speak on the record. He suggested it is up to the American public to assess the truthfulness of her statements from the released transcripts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval for the deployment of the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, to address the city's high crime rate has generated mixed reactions. Some residents and state officials support the move, believing a federal presence will help deter violent crime and accelerate existing law enforcement operations. However, others, including Memphis Mayor Paul Young, argue that the deployment is unnecessary, citing a recent downward trend in crime and expressing concerns about the potential negative impact on the community and local businesses.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company is actively working to reduce internal bureaucracy in an effort to operate more like an innovative startup. Speaking at a conference, he emphasized that as companies grow, they can accumulate unnecessary processes that stifle agility. Jassy has implemented measures such as flattening management structures and creating an email alias for employees to report excessive rules. This cultural overhaul is part of a broader strategy to increase efficiency and competitiveness following a period of significant cost-cutting and layoffs.</p>

          <p>Over a dozen people were injured in two separate mass shootings at homeless encampments in Minneapolis on the same day, highlighting a surge in violence within the city. One shooting occurred at a transit station, while another took place at a controversial encampment on private property. The incidents have intensified the public debate over how the city should address homelessness and public safety. Following the violence, the city moved to clear the encampment, a response that critics argue displaces vulnerable people without solving the root problem.</p>

          <p>A judge in New York has dismissed the two state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. In the ruling, the judge found the terrorism charges to be "legally insufficient," stating that the evidence pointed to a targeted killing rather than an act intended to cause widespread public fear. Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder, and also faces a separate federal case where the death penalty is a possibility.</p>

          <p>This article offers a retrospective on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, celebrating his consistent choice to tackle complex, often flawed characters instead of relying on his conventional good looks for simple heroic roles. It highlights how films like "The Candidate" and "All the President's Men" utilized his all-American image to explore deeper critiques of idealism, success, and corruption. The piece concludes that Redford's enduring legacy is built on his willingness to challenge audiences and sidestep the easy path of a traditional movie star.</p>

          <p>A broad coalition representing University of California faculty, staff, and students has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an unlawful campaign to undermine academic freedom and free speech. The legal action follows the administration's decision to freeze research funding and impose a $1.2 billion fine on UCLA over allegations of on-campus antisemitism. The lawsuit claims the administration is using civil rights laws as a pretext to impose politically motivated demands, including ending diversity scholarships and cooperating with immigration enforcement.</p>

City Attorney's office announced a plea agreement with the property's current developers, who pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders. Construction on the homes was halted in 2002, and the structures have since become a safety hazard and a point of frustration for the community. The demolition is required to be completed by August 2026.</p>

He attributed this potential to the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the strong leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer also observed a positive trend for the entire banking sector, noting that Wall Street appears increasingly willing to assign higher price-to-earnings multiples to financial institutions, signaling growing confidence in their stability and profitability.

          <p>New data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency shows a dramatic shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being taken in automatic cars. This trend is strongly linked to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), which do not use manual gearboxes. With the UK's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars set for 2030, driving instructors say more learners are opting for automatics, which can be simpler to learn and are seen as the future of driving.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 0.25 percentage point cut to its key interest rate, marking the first reduction since last December. The move is seen as a response to recent signs of a weakening labor market, with policymakers aiming to provide a boost to the economy. This decision comes after sustained public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for much deeper cuts. The rate reduction signals a significant shift in the central bank's policy stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, claiming that several articles published in 2024 were malicious and intended to damage his presidential campaign. This article explains that the lawsuit is part of a larger strategy by Trump to intimidate the press and discourage critical coverage. Legal experts believe the suit is highly unlikely to succeed, as defamation cases brought by public figures must meet the extremely high standard of proving "actual malice," and truth serves as an absolute defense.</p>
