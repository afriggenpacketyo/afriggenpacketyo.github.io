        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Portland's mayor, are strongly opposing a potential deployment of federal troops ordered by former President Donald Trump. In an open letter, 110 community leaders argued that such a move would be counterproductive to the city's recovery, citing economic harm and drawing parallels to the divisive 2020 federal intervention. Local law enforcement officials assert that, contrary to the administration's claims, there has been no significant uptick in violent unrest, and that a federal military presence is both unwanted and unnecessary. This situation highlights the ongoing friction between federal and local governance on matters of law enforcement.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has expressed hope that a government shutdown can be avoided ahead of the Tuesday deadline, with a key meeting scheduled between congressional leaders and President Trump. A major point of contention is the Democratic push to extend the Affordable Care Act's tax credits, which they argue are critical for American families facing rising costs. While Republicans like House Majority Leader Steve Scalise advocate for a short-term funding bill to allow for further negotiations, both sides are publicly stating their desire to find a bipartisan agreement. The outcome of Monday's White House meeting is seen as crucial for resolving the impasse.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Jennifer Lopez reflects on her leading role in the new movie musical "Kiss of the Spider Woman," calling it a part she has been waiting for her entire life. She discusses the personal challenges she faced during filming, as it coincided with her divorce from Ben Affleck, who served as one of the film's executive producers. Lopez explains that channeling her energy into the role was a positive outlet during a difficult time and ultimately contributed to her personal growth. The film, a story of two prisoners finding escape through imagination, is described by Lopez as a love letter to the Latin and queer communities.</p>

          <p>The Des Moines school board has placed Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid administrative leave after he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Federal agents allege that Roberts, who previously competed in the Olympics for Guyana, is in the country illegally and subject to a final removal order from 2024. The school board stated it was unaware of any citizenship issues, noting that multiple background checks before his hiring revealed no problems. The Iowa Department of Education is now reviewing the district's hiring procedures, as Roberts had affirmed he was a U.S. citizen on his application for an administrator license.</p>

It examines indices from organizations like Truflation, the Institute for Supply Management, and Adobe, which track real-time prices for commodities, online goods, and business expenses. While some alternative metrics suggest current inflation is lower than government figures, others, particularly from business surveys, indicate that rising costs for manufacturers and small businesses may lead to future price increases for consumers.

          <p>China is developing a new industrial strategy, known as a "pull" system, to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of car manufacturing. This approach aims to transform the aerospace production process by having final assembly stages pull components from suppliers on an as-needed basis, rather than relying on traditional forecasting. The goal is to lower costs, reduce delays, and increase flexibility in space system production. This industrial revolution is seen as a critical step for China to dominate the exponentially growing global space economy.</p>

          <p>According to self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi, certain limiting beliefs prevent many people from increasing their income. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to manage money and earn more, which creates shame and prevents them from seeking help. Another is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and consistent effort. Finally, the tendency to procrastinate by telling oneself they will start "later" is a major obstacle, as the perfect time never arrives. Overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward taking meaningful action to improve one's financial situation.</p>

Democrats view the measure as a crucial step to counter Republican gerrymandering in other states and impede a potential authoritarian agenda.

          <p>Another migrant has died while attempting to cross the English Channel, with a body discovered on a beach near Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France. This death is the latest in a series of tragedies this year, bringing the total number of fatalities from crossing attempts to at least 27. The incident occurred during a weekend that saw a significant surge in crossings, with 895 people arriving in the UK on Saturday alone. The continued attempts highlight the persistent challenges faced by both French and UK authorities in preventing these dangerous journeys, despite increased resources and financial support aimed at stopping them.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos across the United States are installing air quality sensors at their homes and community centers to gather localized pollution data. Motivated by health concerns like asthma, these citizen-led initiatives aim to fill data gaps left by official government monitors, which are often located away from the most affected neighborhoods. Organizations like the Hispanic Access Foundation are providing the tools for communities from Los Angeles to the South Bronx to track harmful pollutants. This grassroots data is then used to advocate for stronger regulations and better enforcement to protect public health in disproportionately affected areas.</p>

          <p>An American expatriate who has helped hundreds of others move abroad addresses several common misconceptions about relocating. Contrary to popular belief, living in Europe is not as cheap as many think, with housing costs rising significantly. She also dispels the myth that Americans are unwelcome, noting that while anti-tourism sentiment exists in some hotspots, genuine efforts to integrate are usually well-received. Other debunked ideas include the inevitability of loneliness, the fantasy of a perfect, problem-free life, and the notion that it is ever "too late" in life to make such a significant move.</p>

          <p>Despite the persistent threat of urban fires, the United States has made remarkable progress in fire safety over the last four decades, cutting the per-capita fire death rate by roughly two-thirds since 1980. This significant reduction is not due to a single breakthrough but rather an accumulation of small, crucial improvements. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, the increased use of automatic sprinkler systems, and the implementation of safer national standards for furniture and cigarettes. These regulatory and public safety efforts demonstrate how incremental changes in building codes and product safety have saved countless lives over time.</p>
