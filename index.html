            <p>Technology stocks faced a sharp downturn on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite on track for its worst single-day performance since 2020, reversing gains from Wednesday's historic rally. The index plummeted by over 7%, driven by declines in major tech companies like Apple, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Wednesday's surge was fueled by President Trump's announcement of a 90-day tariff pause and a reduction in tariffs, but markets corrected course as the White House clarified that the cumulative tariff rate on China would total 145%. This volatility underscores the market's sensitivity to trade policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson condemned the U.S.'s tariff policies, stating they are being used as a weapon to exert pressure and seek selfish gains. This statement followed President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, despite a temporary pause on tariffs for other trade partners. China retaliated by increasing tariffs on all U.S. goods to 84%, asserting its commitment to safeguarding its economy and upholding international interests. The spokesperson emphasized that China does not desire a trade war but will not hesitate to defend itself, indicating escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

            <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona and Modelo, reports that President Trump's immigration policies are negatively impacting beer sales, as Hispanic consumers in the U.S. reduce their spending. CEO Bill Newlands stated that concerns within the Hispanic community regarding immigration issues and potential job losses are causing them to cut back on discretionary spending, including social gatherings where beer is often consumed. This pullback in spending has affected Constellation's beer sales, despite the company's efforts to broaden its consumer base. Constellation gave a weaker-than-expected outlook for its fiscal 2026, also influenced by tariffs on Mexican imports.</p>

            <p>Inflation eased in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, but economists caution that new tariffs could reverse this trend, with groceries remaining a concern. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4% year-over-year, down from 2.8% in February, while core CPI also decreased, reaching its lowest level since March 2021. Economists warn that tariffs, which act as taxes on U.S. importers, will increase costs for businesses, ultimately passed on to consumers. Projections estimate that Trump's tariff policy could push U.S. inflation to around 4% by the end of 2025, significantly above the Federal Reserve's target.</p>

            <p>A significant short squeeze contributed to Wednesday's historic stock market rally, as hedge funds rushed to cover their short positions amid news of a tariff pause. Ahead of the announcement, short bets against U.S. stocks had reached record levels, but the tariff pause triggered a surge in stock prices, forcing hedge funds to buy back borrowed stocks to limit losses. This artificial buying pressure led to the S&P 500 achieving its third-biggest gain since World War II, with a basket of the most shorted stocks jumping by 12.5%. The session saw a record-breaking 30 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to partially roll back sweeping tariff announcements reveals the ongoing influence of Wall Street on his administration. The reversal came after a week of market turmoil, with stocks plunging and investors expressing unease over the potential economic impact of the tariffs. Trump cited market reactions and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's warning about a potential recession as factors in his decision to pivot. This incident demonstrates that despite Trump's tendency to challenge norms, the market and key figures in the financial sector still play a significant role in shaping his policies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China, now at 145%, could significantly impact the cost of popular gadgets like iPhones, laptops, and tablets in the U.S. Analysts predict that if these costs are passed on to consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise substantially, potentially by hundreds of dollars. Apple is exploring options to mitigate the impact, including increasing production in India and diversifying its supply chain. The tariffs may also lead to longer phone contracts to spread out the cost of devices, with some analysts suggesting the possibility of five-year contracts.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's partial pause on tariffs, significant and lasting damage has already been inflicted on businesses, financial markets, and consumer confidence. The initial tariff announcements triggered market turmoil, undermined faith in U.S. Treasuries, and prompted the Federal Reserve to hesitate on monetary policy adjustments. This volatility has created uncertainty for businesses and investors, hindering investment and hiring decisions. Furthermore, the continued high tariffs on China and the possibility of future policy reversals maintain a climate of instability, posing long-term risks to the U.S. economy and its global standing.</p>

            <p>Adam Beckman, a minor league player for the New York Islanders, has been suspended for 10 games for physical abuse of an official. The incident occurred during a game against the Charlotte Checkers, where Beckman appeared to shove a referee into the boards, resulting in a harsh reaction from fans. The suspension means Beckman will miss the remainder of the regular season and the next five games he is active on an AHL roster. Beckman was acquired by the Islanders in a trade with the New Jersey Devils less than a month prior to the incident.</p>

            <p>Economist Justin Wolfers discusses the economic impact of President Trump's recent tariff policies, describing the situation as "tariff-mageddon." While Trump has announced a pause on some tariffs, tariffs on China have increased to 125%, and a 10% tariff remains in place for every country worldwide. Wolfers suggests that the president's actions have created a high level of economic uncertainty, potentially leading to a recession and stagflation. He also suggests that the bond market's reaction to the policies indicates a lack of confidence in the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The film âWarfare,â co-written and directed by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, offers a taut and realistic portrayal of combat, stripping away Hollywood clichÃ©s. Based on a real incident in Ramadi, Iraq, in 2006, the film focuses on the experiences of a platoon of Navy SEALs during a firefight. The film features a cast of young actors, including Will Poulter, Charles Melton, and Joseph Quinn, and emphasizes the chaos and intensity of war. Unlike typical war movies, "Warfare" avoids speeches and sentimental moments, instead focusing on the brutal and often mundane realities of battle.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's announcement of a "reciprocal tariffs" followed by a 90-day pause has created a historic upheaval in American trade policy, sending shockwaves through the global trading system. While the pause provides some relief, a new minimum 10% tariff rate remains in place for goods from all countries, and tariffs on China have been hiked to 125%. Economists warn that this represents a major shift in US trade policy, harming the global economy and creating uncertainty. The UK and other countries with existing free trade deals with Washington will also be subject to the 10% tariff.</p>

            <p>The US House of Representatives has approved a budget bill championed by President Trump, which includes significant cuts to taxes and government spending. The bill passed despite opposition from Democrats and some Republican hard-liners, marking a key step in Trump's legislative agenda. While the House bill features deeper spending cuts than the version passed by the Senate, the two versions must now be reconciled into a single bill for Trump to sign into law. Trump celebrated the bill's passage, calling it a "big, beautiful bill" that sets the stage for historic tax and regulation cuts.</p>

The budget resolution will open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts. Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority.</p>
