          <p>President Trump has reportedly approved attack plans on Iran but hasn't yet given the final order to proceed.  Sources say he's waiting to see if Iran will negotiate an end to its nuclear program.  The plans involve multiple strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the Fordo facility.  The Israeli experience with incomplete air defense neutralization is a concern.</p>
