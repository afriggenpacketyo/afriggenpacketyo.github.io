          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson criticized China for straining relations with the U.S. due to the ban on Nvidia's AI chips, citing intellectual property theft and disregard for fair trade. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed disappointment but acknowledged larger agendas between the two countries. China's access to the U.S. chip market is crucial for U.S. chipmakers, and this ban is the latest in a series of economic battles over high-end AI chips. The White House previously reached a deal with Nvidia and AMD to resume chip sales to China with a 15% sales payment to the U.S. government. The article highlights the ongoing tensions and economic implications of the chip ban. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy has denied these claims, stating Monarez told him she was untrustworthy.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attributes a surge in assaults against ICE agents to dangerous political rhetoric targeting immigration enforcement, citing a 1,000% increase in such incidents. The DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called on the media and the left to cease what she described as hateful rhetoric aimed at President Trump and DHS law enforcement, arguing that this demonization inspires violence. The DHS provided examples of inflammatory rhetoric, including comparisons of ICE to slave patrols and the Gestapo, and cataloged instances of physical violence against ICE officers. The article underscores the growing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the potential consequences of divisive language.</p>

          <p>Kenya's public pension and health insurance systems are plagued by fraud, leaving many citizens without promised security in retirement and health care. An Auditor General's report revealed over 260,000 cases of fraudulent activities targeting pension schemes, resulting in the loss of over $515 million between 2013 and 2020. Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale admitted that hospitals stole over $804 million from the health tax fund. The article highlights the systemic weaknesses, mismanagement, and corruption within Kenya's social security systems, leading to public unrest and a loss of confidence in the government's policies.</p>

          <p>A Yale study reveals that Russia is subjecting thousands of abducted Ukrainian children to forced militarization in at least 210 facilities across Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine. These children are being indoctrinated with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian narratives and, in some cases, engaged in combat and paratrooper training or the production of military equipment. Ukraine's "Bring Kids Back" program reports over 19,500 children have been abducted, with only about 1,600 returned. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova for war crimes related to the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children. </p>

          <p>Experts advise caution regarding financial planning opportunities arising from President Donald Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction, as further clarification is needed. The deduction allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in "qualified tips" per year from 2025 through 2028. However, eligibility depends on whether the job is a "specified service trade or business" and whether the worker is a W-2 employee or self-employed. The article recommends consulting with a tax professional or financial advisor once more details are released by the Treasury and IRS. (not investment advice)</p>
