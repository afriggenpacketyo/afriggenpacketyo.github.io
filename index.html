        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's National Health Service is attempting to maintain services during a five-day strike by resident doctors over a long-standing pay dispute. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has vowed to limit the impact, instructing hospitals to avoid canceling treatments except in exceptional circumstances, a departure from previous walkouts. The British Medical Association warns this approach could stretch staff too thinly and risk patient safety, emphasizing that pay restoration is key to resolving the conflict. The strike proceeds after talks on non-pay issues failed, with over a million appointments having been canceled in previous industrial actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Bullingham, chief executive of the English Football Association, has stated his opposition to expanding the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football. He believes the current model already causes sufficient interruptions to the game's flow. This stance comes amid speculation that football's law-making body, IFAB, might consider extending VAR's powers to decisions like corner kicks and second yellow cards. The FA, which holds a vote on IFAB, has made its position clear, prioritizing game fluidity over increased technological intervention for more minor officiating calls.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has lowered its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The company attributes the decline to the significant impact of U.S. import tariffs, increased sales of lower-margin electric vehicles, and restructuring costs. The auto giant is navigating a challenging market characterized by strong competition and trade uncertainties. As a result, Volkswagen now projects a full-year operating return on sales between 4% and 5%, down from its previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to contain an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a parasite whose larvae eat the flesh of living animals. The infestation has prompted the United States to once again bar imports of Mexican cattle, creating significant economic pressure. Veterinarians and ranchers in the state of Chiapas report being overwhelmed, with the cost of medicine soaring and a new sterile-fly production plant not expected to be operational until next year. The situation highlights a growing agricultural crisis that threatens livestock and has frozen a key export market for Mexico.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits his Scottish golf properties, the U.K. government aims to resolve outstanding issues in its recent trade agreement with the United States. While a deal with a 10% baseline tariff is in place, key commitments, such as the removal of a 25% tariff on U.K. steel and aluminum, remain unfinished. Discussions are also ongoing regarding the U.K.'s digital services tax, which Washington opposes. The visit provides an opportunity for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to negotiate these final points, potentially trading concessions on the digital tax for the removal of metal tariffs.

          <p>Kelly Osbourne expressed her grief following the reported death of her father, heavy metal pioneer Ozzy Osbourne, at the age of 76. In a social media post, she shared lyrics from their number-one hit duet 'Changes,' stating she had lost her 'best friend.' The article reports that the Black Sabbath frontman passed away on a Tuesday, just weeks after a final farewell performance in his hometown of Birmingham. The father-daughter duo were known for their close bond, famously documented on the MTV reality show 'The Osbournes' in the early 2000s.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell at the Florida prison where she is serving a 20-year sentence. The interview is part of an effort to gather information about other individuals who may have been involved in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. The meeting comes amid increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to the Epstein case. Maxwell's attorney confirmed she answered all questions during the full-day session, which marks the first time the government has formally interviewed her for this purpose since her conviction.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced another round of severe flash flooding following heavy afternoon rainfall, leading to road closures and water rescues. The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the surrounding hillsides of vegetation. Videos on social media showed a mobile home being swept away by the torrent of muddy water, which caused the Rio Ruidoso to rise dramatically. This event follows deadly floods earlier in the month, as the community grapples with the ongoing threat posed by the summer monsoon season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has employed an unusual legal tactic to ensure Alina Habba, the president's former personal attorney, remains in charge of the U.S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey. After federal judges in the state selected a different candidate, the White House withdrew Habba's official nomination only to immediately reinstall her as the 'acting' U.S. Attorney. This move appears to exploit a vacancy law to bypass the judicial selection process and restart the clock on her temporary term. The maneuver has drawn criticism and created confusion over leadership at the key prosecutor's office.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to his Scottish golf courses is being framed as a trip that offers a temporary escape from the persistent controversy surrounding his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. However, the story is likely to follow him, as his visit is met with large-scale protests and intense media scrutiny that will keep the issue in the public eye. The trip, intended for business and informal diplomacy, is overshadowed by political drama back in the U.S., where questions about the Epstein files continue to mount. This creates an awkward backdrop for meetings with UK and Scottish leaders.</p>

          <p>Three officials who were abruptly fired from the Department of Justice have filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi, challenging their terminations. The plaintiffs, including a veteran prosecutor who handled January 6th cases, argue their dismissals were unlawful and did not follow established civil service procedures. They were informed of their firings in brief memos citing the president's Article II powers, without specific cause. The lawsuit seeks their immediate reinstatement and back pay, alleging the firings were arbitrary and part of a broader, politically motivated purge within the department.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds actually slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to how bending the material changes electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels. The breakthrough could pave the way for developing ultra-low-friction nanodevices and more efficient machines with minimal wear.</p>

Its population surged from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 in 2023, driven by affordable housing compared to the rest of the county. This explosive growth has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt new construction to allow infrastructure like roads, water, and sewer lines to catch up.

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior ice hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, Justice Maria Carroccia stated she did not find the complainant's evidence to be 'credible or reliable,' and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The high-profile trial centered on the issue of consent, with the players contending the encounter was consensual and the woman testifying she was intoxicated and fearful. The verdict concludes a case that has drawn significant public attention and scrutiny in Canada.</p>
