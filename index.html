          <h2>Tropical Depression Chantal Causes Widespread Flooding in North Carolina</h2>

          <p>Tropical Depression Chantal brought heavy rainfall to North Carolina, resulting in significant flash flooding and numerous water rescues across several counties. The storm system, which was downgraded from a tropical storm after making landfall, caused infrastructure damage, including a collapsed highway, and prompted flood watches across multiple mid-Atlantic states. While no injuries were immediately reported, the event highlights the ongoing risks of an active Atlantic hurricane season, with forecasters expecting continued rain and dangerous surf conditions along the coast. The National Weather Service noted that some river levels were approaching historic records set in 1996.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 81 fatalities, with another 41 people reported missing as of Sunday. The disaster, concentrated in Kerr County, tragically impacted a riverside Christian girls' camp, where multiple children and the camp's director died after the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in under an hour. A massive search-and-rescue effort is underway, though officials expect the death toll to rise. President Trump has declared a major disaster, activating federal aid, as communities grapple with the horrific aftermath and brace for more rain.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. have created small robots, known as "Pipebots," designed to autonomously navigate inside water mains to find and fix leaks without disruptive excavation. These robots use cameras and acoustic sensors to identify cracks in aging infrastructure, a significant issue in the U.K. where old pipes waste millions of gallons of water daily. The initiative is part of a broader plan supported by the UK's water regulator to modernize infrastructure maintenance. This technology could offer a more efficient and cost-effective solution for managing water systems globally.</p>

          <p>Huawei's Noah’s Ark Lab has publicly defended its open-source Pangu Pro MoE 72B artificial intelligence model, stating it was developed indigenously on its own Ascend AI chips. The statement comes in response to allegations from a whistleblower on GitHub who claimed the model showed an "extraordinary correlation" with Alibaba's Qwen-2.5 14B model, suggesting it was built upon the competitor's work. Huawei acknowledged using some open-source code from other models but asserted it strictly followed licensing requirements. The controversy arises as Huawei strives to maintain its competitive edge in China's growing LLM landscape.</p>

          <p>Mexican prosecutors have alleged that former boxing champion Julio César Chávez Jr. served as a henchman for the Sinaloa cartel before his recent arrest in the U.S. An indictment claims he was directed by cartel leader Néstor "El Nini" Pérez Salas to physically assault rival gang members. The allegations are based on intercepted phone calls and other evidence. Chávez Jr., who was arrested by U.S. immigration officials citing cartel affiliations and an active Mexican arrest warrant, is currently facing deportation proceedings. His family has expressed confidence in his innocence, while his father has suggested he is in rehab.</p>

Reich argues this is part of a broader, politically motivated strategy by the Trump administration to exert control over higher education, following a playbook similar to that of Hungarian President Viktor Orbán. He contends that targeting universities under the guise of issues like DEI or antisemitism is an attempt to suppress independent thought and weaken a key obstacle to authoritarianism.</p>

The lawsuit, brought by the American Association of University Professors and other academic groups, argues the policy is unconstitutional and has created a chilling effect on free speech across university campuses. The government contends it has the authority to deport noncitizens whose presence it deems a threat to U.S. foreign policy.

          <p>The traditional American model of suburban sprawl, long a source of affordable housing, is showing signs of strain, particularly in the fast-growing Sunbelt region. A new economic paper reveals that housing construction in metros like Phoenix and Atlanta has plummeted, causing prices to surge and mirroring the affordability crises seen in coastal cities. The analysis suggests that restrictive zoning laws and local opposition to new development in established suburbs are "closing the suburban frontier." This trend indicates a systemic failure in housing policy that requires a fundamental rethinking of how American suburbs can grow and adapt.</p>

It argues that contemplative practice can enhance one's ability to act compassionately, while engagement with the world's problems can deepen spiritual insight. The piece recommends integrating both pursuits by building periods of retreat and reflection into an active, service-oriented career, rather than viewing them as a binary choice.</p>

While some experts see the dollar's fall as a temporary correction after a long period of strength, others argue it reflects a broader trend of de-dollarization accelerated by recent policies. The debate centers on whether this is a momentary adjustment or the beginning of a shift toward a multi-polar currency system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Democratic Party Reportedly Scaling Back on Ambitious Climate Policies Amid Affordability Concerns</h2>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Democrats in California and other states are retreating from aggressive climate change initiatives due to concerns about the rising cost of living and recent electoral losses. In California, this has included softening environmental review laws, pausing a cap on oil industry profits, and reconsidering clean fuel mandates. This retrenchment echoes Republican arguments and frustrates environmental allies, who see it as a capitulation to political pressure. The pivot highlights a broader challenge for the party as it attempts to balance long-term environmental goals with the immediate economic anxieties of working-class voters.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Weigh In on the Controversy Surrounding Seed Oils and Health</h2>

          <p>The claim that seed oils like canola and soybean oil are toxic and driving chronic disease has gained traction, but many nutrition researchers say the science is being misrepresented. While these oils are highly processed and rich in omega-6 fatty acids, clinical studies have not found that they cause inflammation. In fact, research shows that replacing saturated fats with these plant oils can lower bad cholesterol and reduce heart disease risk. Experts agree that Americans should consume fewer ultra-processed foods, where seed oils are prevalent, and focus on a balanced diet rich in whole foods and omega-3s.</p>

          <p>Biosphere 2, the massive enclosed ecosystem in the Arizona desert once famous for its controversial 1990s human survival experiments, has been transformed into a serious scientific research facility. Now operated by the University of Arizona, scientists use its contained environments—including a rainforest, an ocean, and a desert—to conduct large-scale experiments on climate change. Current projects include studying the heat tolerance of coffee and cacao trees, creating a refuge for endangered pupfish, and testing methods to restore coral reefs. The facility has evolved from a pop culture punchline into a unique laboratory for understanding and adapting to changes on Earth.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, potentially over a million undocumented and unplugged oil and gas wells, known as orphan wells, are leaking methane and other toxins into the air and water. These relics of past drilling booms, abandoned by defunct companies, contribute to climate change and pose environmental risks. A multi-billion dollar federal effort is now underway to locate and plug these wells, a complex task involving historical research, modern technology like drones, and fieldwork. However, experts warn that without policy changes to hold current operators accountable, the number of orphan wells will continue to grow.</p>

          <p>The Park Slope Food Co-op in Brooklyn, a 52-year-old member-owned grocer, has become a flashpoint for conflict over the war in Gaza. A pro-Palestinian faction is pushing for a boycott of Israeli-made products, while a pro-Israeli group opposes the move, citing divisiveness and alleging a hostile, antisemitic environment. The dispute has intensified, influencing board elections and leading to formal discrimination complaints. The co-op, which has a history of politically motivated boycotts, is now struggling to manage the internal strife, reflecting how global conflicts are impacting local community spaces.</p>

          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old from London, has been released from a Dubai prison and has returned to the UK after receiving a royal pardon. He was sentenced to a year in prison in December for having a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old British girl while on holiday, as the age of consent in the UAE is 18. The case was reported by the girl's mother and drew international attention. The campaign group Detained in Dubai, which supported Fakana, highlighted the case as an example of the risks tourists face from the UAE's strict laws.</p>

According to police, the woman confined her medium-sized dog in the locker, which already contained a stroller, so she could tour the castle. Security staff were alerted by other concerned visitors and freed the animal. The dog was reported to be unharmed but was visibly relieved upon being rescued from the hot and cramped space. The incident has prompted a police investigation under Germany's animal welfare laws.</p>

          <p>The legacy of Kenya's "Saba Saba" (July 7) protests of the 1990s, which pushed for multi-party democracy, is being compared to the recent youth-led demonstrations against new tax laws and police brutality. Analysts note that both movements were driven by a demand for better governance, accountability, and an end to corruption, though today's protests are more grassroots and technologically savvy. Despite a new constitution, many of the old grievances remain, including the use of state force against demonstrators. The ongoing unrest highlights a persistent struggle for political accountability and human rights in the country.</p>

          <p>Groq, an AI semiconductor startup positioning itself as a challenger to Nvidia, has announced its first European data center in Helsinki, Finland, as part of its international expansion. The company designs specialized chips called Language Processing Units (LPUs) optimized for AI inferencing, the process of generating answers from trained models. CEO Jonathan Ross stated that Groq's technology, which does not rely on the same supply-constrained components as Nvidia's GPUs, is well-suited for the high-volume inference market. The move into Europe aims to capitalize on growing demand and the push for "sovereign AI" capabilities within the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has extended the deadline for new sweeping tariffs to August 1, delaying an earlier July 9 cutoff and providing trade partners with a brief reprieve. Concurrently, President Trump announced that any country aligning with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS" would face an additional 10% tariff, with no exceptions. The threat came as the BRICS bloc of developing nations issued a statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. The administration will begin sending letters detailing country-specific tariff rates and any deals reached, continuing a period of global trade uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
