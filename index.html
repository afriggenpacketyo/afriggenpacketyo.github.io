          <p>Billy Vigar, a 21-year-old striker for Chichester City FC and a former Arsenal youth player, has died after sustaining a significant brain injury during a match. The injury occurred during a game against Wingate and Finchley in the Isthmian League Premier Division. It is believed the injury resulted from a collision with a concrete wall adjacent to the pitch, though this has not been officially confirmed by the club. Vigar's family expressed their devastation, stating he was injured while playing the sport he deeply loved, highlighting the tragic and unforeseen nature of the incident.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is encountering significant backlash from fellow Labour Party MPs regarding his perceived leadership aspirations. Following a series of interviews where he criticized the current Labour government and claimed MPs were urging him to challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, a BBC survey revealed little appetite for such a move. Many MPs expressed that a leadership challenge would be destabilizing and self-indulgent, urging Burnham to concentrate on his mayoral duties. The internal friction comes as Starmer's government navigates recent scandals and staff resignations, adding another layer of complexity to the party's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has suspended specific cloud and AI services for Unit 8200, a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, following an investigation into its practices. The decision was prompted by a report from The Guardian alleging the unit developed a system to track Palestinians' phone calls using these services. Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, confirmed that their review found evidence supporting the report, specifically related to the use of Azure storage and AI services. This action follows internal pressure from Microsoft employees protesting the use of company technology in the Gaza conflict and comes shortly after a UN commission's report on Israel's actions.</p>

          <p>Shares of used-vehicle retailer CarMax fell by over 20% after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that failed to meet Wall Street's expectations. The company's revenue was approximately $6.6 billion, a 6% decrease from the previous year, with overall vehicle sales dropping by 4.1%. CEO Bill Nash described the quarter as challenging, attributing the poor performance to shifting market conditions and depreciation of its inventory. The significant stock drop, reaching its lowest point since March 2020, also negatively impacted the stock prices of other auto retailers, as CarMax's results are often seen as an industry indicator.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign a deal that will permit TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a potential ban. The agreement structures TikTok's U.S. operations as a joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will manage the security of U.S. user data and review the app's code. Under the deal, TikTok's recommendation algorithm will be retrained using only U.S. user data, while its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, will retain a minority stake below the 20% foreign ownership limit set by law.

          <p>The individual who opened fire on a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, killing one detainee and injuring two others, left a note indicating a desire to instill terror in ICE agents. The FBI revealed the note, which stated, "Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror." The shooter, identified as Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the attack. An investigation found that Jahn had searched for apps tracking ICE agents and downloaded a list of DHS facilities, suggesting a high degree of planning for what is being investigated as an act of targeted violence against law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is ending its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks, mandating a shift to electronic payments for its nearly 70 million beneficiaries starting September 30.

The SSA notes that electronic payments are significantly less likely to be lost or stolen than paper checks. While the transition is comprehensive, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means to receive payments, addressing concerns for the unbanked population who rely on the traditional system.</p>

          <p>In a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump heavily criticized European immigration policies and singled out London, claiming the city wants to adopt "Sharia law" under its "terrible mayor." He asserted that an influx of what he termed "illegal aliens" is causing serious trouble for Europe. London Mayor Sadiq Khan responded forcefully, labeling President Trump as racist, sexist, and Islamophobic. Khan suggested the comments were a personal attack and emphasized that a strong U.S.-U.K. relationship should allow for calling out a partner when they are wrong, highlighting a significant diplomatic clash between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump publicly urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop purchasing oil from Russia. Trump framed the request as a crucial step in cutting off Moscow's energy funding amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, calling it "the best thing" Erdogan could do. The discussion occurred as Turkey seeks to resolve issues with the U.S., including its removal from the F-35 fighter jet program after acquiring a Russian air defense system. While Trump expressed optimism about lifting sanctions and resolving the F-35 issue, the meeting concluded without any firm commitments on these key diplomatic points.</p>

          <p>Major streaming platforms, including Disney+ and Apple TV+, are implementing another round of price hikes, adding to consumer frustration over the rising cost of digital entertainment. What was once seen as a cost-effective alternative to cable has evolved into a significant financial burden for many households, with subscribers now facing a complex landscape of bundled services and frequent price changes. Industry experts note that streaming companies are battling for profitability and trying to combat 'churn,' where users subscribe and cancel based on content. This has led to a strategic shift, with companies reintroducing bundles and raising prices, testing the loyalty of a consumer base that increasingly views these services as essential.</p>

The Taliban has rejected any proposal to hand over the base, citing the 2020 Doha agreement.

In recent meetings, senior U.S. officials communicated to their Argentine counterparts that Washington expects a reduction in the use of a Chinese credit line, currently valued at approximately US$18 billion. The U.S. position is that this financial dependence poses a long-term threat to Argentine sovereignty and provides China with an avenue to expand its influence in South America. This demand highlights the ongoing geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China for influence in the region, placing Argentina in a delicate diplomatic position.</p>

Unreliable cellular service and a variety of unconnected platforms prevented the sharing of real-time information.

          <p>With the median annual cost of nursing home care exceeding $120,000 and expected to rise, planning for long-term care has become a critical issue for retirees. This article examines whether long-term care insurance is a worthwhile investment, especially as many people mistakenly believe Medicare will cover these expenses, when it typically only covers short-term skilled care after a hospitalization. The analysis highlights that purchasing a policy earlier in life, while still in good health, is crucial for securing affordable premiums and avoiding denial of coverage. For middle-income retirees with significant savings to protect, this type of insurance can be a vital tool to prevent the depletion of assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce government plans for a mandatory, UK-wide digital identification scheme. According to senior officials, the initiative is aimed at curbing illegal employment and modernizing state services by linking an individual's ID to a central database for right-to-work checks. The proposal marks a significant policy shift, as a similar ID card plan by a previous Labour government was scrapped by the subsequent coalition. The announcement has already drawn criticism from opposition parties, including the Conservatives and Reform UK, who have raised concerns about civil liberties and questioned the scheme's effectiveness in tackling illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled its "Pride in Place" program, a long-term investment of up to £5 billion designated for 339 communities across the country. The funding is intended to boost local high streets, parks, and public spaces, with spending decisions to be driven by local community groups and organizations rather than council bids. Some areas will receive £2 million annually for a decade, while others get a one-off £1.5 million payment. The initiative also aims to empower councils to purchase derelict properties for redevelopment and block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops, in an effort to restore local pride.</p>

          <p>Denmark is grappling with how to respond after a coordinated series of drone sightings over multiple airports and military bases exposed significant vulnerabilities in its national security. The incidents, which occurred across the Jutland peninsula, forced the temporary closure of Aalborg and Billund airports and involved drones over critical military installations. While no damage was caused and officials decided against shooting them down over safety concerns, the event has been labeled a "hybrid attack" by the Defence Minister. The Danish government is now assessing its response and considering whether to invoke NATO's Article 4 for consultation, highlighting the growing threat of hybrid warfare across Europe.</p>

The move reflects growing concerns in Washington about reliance on foreign supply chains for critical products and is intended to assess whether domestic production can meet national demand.

This is the second deadly prison riot in the country in just a few days, adding to the approximately 500 inmates killed in such violence since 2021. The incident underscores the extreme lack of control authorities have over the nation's overcrowded prisons, which have become command centers for powerful gangs like Los Choneros and Los Lobos. Ecuador, situated between major cocaine producers Colombia and Peru, continues to struggle with spiraling gang-related violence both inside and outside its penitentiaries.</p>

He credits his early dedication to challenging stage work, including a one-man show where he played 19 characters, with giving him the confidence for the part.

The verdict has deeply divided France, with Sarkozy and his supporters claiming he is the victim of a long-standing vendetta by a left-wing judiciary. Critics, however, view the sentence as just accountability for a political figure who has consistently pushed legal boundaries, noting his previous corruption convictions. The case highlights the persistent political polarization in the country, with arguments over the ruling echoing the deep-seated rifts between the nation's right and left factions.</p>

The ruling found the remarks broke guidelines against abusive language aimed at real people and could be characterized as antisemitic.

In a trial conducted with IBM, the bank combined classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, resulting in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of algorithmic bond price predictions. This enhancement allows for a better estimation of the likelihood that a trade will be completed at a quoted price, which can lead to increased margins and greater market liquidity.
