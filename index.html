          <p>A Russian overnight strike on Kyiv resulted in 14 deaths and over 100 injuries, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack involved hundreds of drones and missiles, with Ukraine's air force reporting that many were neutralized but impacts occurred in 10 locations, leaving debris in 34. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as pure terrorism, stating that impacts were also reported in Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Kirovohrad, and Mykolaiv. He urged the U.S. and Europe to respond appropriately to Russia's actions, which he attributed to Putin's desire to continue the war.</p>

Leiter clarified that Israel is not seeking regime change but aims to neutralize the threat posed by Iran's nuclear weaponization program and ballistic missile program. He mentioned ongoing efforts to dismantle surface-to-surface missile systems throughout Iran, including a recent strike on a broadcast center in Tehran after warning residents to evacuate.

          <p>Fans attending the Club World Cup match at the Rose Bowl described conditions as 'dangerous' due to high heat, lack of water access, and tightly packed crowds. Attendees reported having to dispose of water bottles before entry, long lines for water purchases, and crowded misting stations, with temperatures reaching at least 88F (31C). The Rose Bowl typically allows sealed water bottles, but FIFA regulations took precedence, banning most bottles except empty, transparent, reusable ones. Several attendees expressed reluctance to attend future events, including the World Cup, due to the poorly managed experience.</p>

          <p>President Trump's early departure from the G7 summit signals a potential escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, following his urging of Iranians to evacuate Tehran. G7 leaders affirmed support for Israel while calling for a resolution to escalating tensions. Trump dismissed claims of a ceasefire offer, stating the situation was "much bigger than that." The conflict continues, with Israel claiming to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander. The G7 economies comprise the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>

The total amount of purchases will decline to about 2 trillion yen monthly in early 2027.
