          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-31 01:06:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's parliament voted to significantly increase military spending, abandoning decades-long pacifist sentiments fueled by its history.  This decision is driven by concerns about Russian aggression and a perceived weakening of US protection. The article highlights differing opinions among Germans regarding this shift, with some expressing unease about militarism while others see it as a necessary response to current geopolitical realities.  A potential bias is present in the article's focus on the urgency of the military buildup, possibly downplaying counterarguments and emphasizing the threat perception.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk donated over $20 million to support a conservative candidate in Wisconsin's Supreme Court election, framing the race as crucial for Donald Trump's agenda.
