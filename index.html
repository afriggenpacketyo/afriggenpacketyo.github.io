          <p>The recent Middle East conflict has not caused a major oil crisis, despite initial price spikes. This resilience is attributed to several factors: Iran's avoidance of disrupting oil supplies, traders' skepticism towards geopolitical price hikes, the approach of the lower-demand autumn season, an oversupplied oil market, and the US's significant oil production capacity. These factors have mitigated the expected impact on global oil prices.</p>
