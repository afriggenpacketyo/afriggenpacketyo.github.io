          <p>After being held captive by Hamas since October 7, 2023, American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, 21, was released on Monday following negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas. The International Committee of the Red Cross facilitated his transfer to Israeli authorities, and he spoke with his mother by phone. Alexander, who moved to Israel from New Jersey at 18 and was serving in the IDF, was the last living American citizen believed to be held hostage by Hamas. His release is viewed as a goodwill gesture toward the Trump administration and a potential opening for broader conflict talks, though negotiations for the remains of dead American hostages are ongoing.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in the United Kingdom recently uncovered a Late Bronze Age settlement and cremation cemetery dating back 3,000 years while constructing a highway. The excavation site, located on the construction site of Europa Way in Suffolk, revealed 18 burials dating back to 1200 B.C., along with remains of structures and ancient artifacts. Finds included postholes of roundhouses, cremation urns, a copper-alloy pin, and a rare flint quern used for grinding grain. Experts suggest the discovery is important for understanding prehistoric activity in the Gipping valley.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in their ongoing trade war, according to the article. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement, which suspends tariffs for 90 days, aims to allow further negotiations focused on opening China to American businesses. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the two countries shared an interest in avoiding economic decoupling, with China agreeing to suspend countermeasures adopted in retaliation for escalating tariffs.</p>

          <p>Sharpe James, the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, who served for 20 years and oversaw a downtown resurgence, has died at the age of 89.

He was convicted of conspiring to sell city-owned properties to a former companion at a fraction of their value.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices in the United States, but the order's practical implementation and legal authority remain unclear. The order asks drugmakers to voluntarily reduce prices of key medicines, threatening regulatory actions or drug imports from other countries if they don't comply. This move is seen as a win for the pharmaceutical industry, which had been bracing for more damaging policies. The order also calls for investigating why European countries get lower prices and pushing them to pay more, though the administration's leverage to do so is limited.</p>

While acknowledging the positive impact of the trade discussions, Cramer notes that the agreement is temporary and investors should closely monitor trade talks for a longer-term deal.</p>

It asserts that tariffs are regressive taxes disproportionately affecting lower-income individuals, while the administration's fiscal plans exacerbate the U.S. government's deficit and federal debt. The author claims that these policies maximize the presidentâ€™s power to punish enemies and sell favors, creating an environment of financial volatility and potential speculative profits for those with inside access.</p>
