          <p>Willie Mullins expressed immense joy after his son, jockey Patrick Mullins, led a 1-2-3 victory in the Grand National. Mullins, typically composed, was overcome with emotion, describing the win as the peak of his career and like a scene from a Disney film. Nick Rockett secured the win at Aintree, followed by I Am Maximus and Grangeclare West, solidifying Mullins' dominance in the sport and positioning him to potentially repeat last year's British championship win. This victory held special significance due to the familial connection and the unprecedented achievement of training the top three horses. </p>

          <p>Torrential rains and flash flooding struck parts of the Midwest and South, exacerbating the devastation caused by recent tornadoes. A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky died after being swept away by floodwaters while walking to his school bus, and another man also died in Kentucky, bringing the weather-related death toll to nine. The National Weather Prediction Center warned of potentially historic rainfall amounts, with some areas expected to receive 10-15 inches or more, leading to catastrophic flash flooding risks. Water rescue teams were deployed, and FEMA is preparing to distribute aid as the region braces for continued severe weather. </p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Women May Possess More Sensitive Hearing Than Men</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Scientific Reports indicates that women may have more sensitive hearing than men. Researchers conducted hearing tests on 448 individuals from 13 global communities, finding that gender and environment are the primary influences on hearing sensitivity, followed by age. Women consistently showed higher sensitivity by an average of two decibels across all populations sampled. The study suggests this could be due to hormonal differences or slight structural variations in cochlear anatomy, while also noting that increased sensitivity in noisy environments may not always be beneficial. </p>

          <p>New York state officials have declared they will not comply with the Trump administration's demand to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in public schools, despite threats to terminate federal education funding. Daniel Morton-Bentley, counsel and deputy commissioner of the state Department of Education, stated that the federal agency lacks the authority to make such demands. He emphasized that no federal or state laws prohibit DEI principles and that the state has already certified compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are challenging the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions and results in inflated rates. According to the American Enterprise Institute, the formula uses an elasticity rate lower than it should be, leading to tariffs that are significantly higher than justified. If the elasticity assumptions are adjusted, the report says no country's tariff would exceed 14%, and most would be at exactly 10%. Another report from the Cato Institute also found flaws in the formula, stating that the trade-weighted average tariff rates are higher than in practice. </p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of over seven years for former U.S. Representative George Santos, citing a "brazen web of deceit." Santos is accused of defrauding donors, misleading voters, and falsifying campaign finance reports to advance his political career. The government alleges that Santos, with the help of his former Campaign Treasurer, fabricated donor contributions, laundered money through a fraudulent political consulting firm, and used an elderly woman's credit card for personal expenses. Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023 and has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity fraud. </p>

          <p>Michigan has joined 18 other states in filing a lawsuit against President Trump's election order, arguing that it violates the Constitution. The lawsuit challenges key aspects of the order, including requirements for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and the demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. State attorneys general argue that the President lacks the authority to control state voting laws and that the order disrupts elections. The lawsuit underscores a growing conflict between state and federal powers regarding election administration. </p>

          <h2>Trump Tariff Formula Misrepresents Global Trade Economics, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 12:40:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic experts are criticizing the Trump administration's tariff formula, stating that it misrepresents global trade economics. The formula, which calculates tariffs based on the trade deficit of each nation with the value of its imports, is considered flawed and not aligned with modern definitions of trade deficits. Experts argue that trade deficits are influenced by financial markets, not solely by demand for imports and manufacturing. The use of this formula raises concerns about the accuracy and fairness of the tariffs imposed on various trading partners. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump’s announcement of nearly global tariffs included a 25 percent hike on goods imported to the U.S. from South Korea. Some skin-care enthusiasts had been preparing for possible trade disruptions, and are now springing into action, as tariffs will hit their next shipment to the U.S. and will have to be passed on to customers. The tariffs will test whether a higher price outweighs other benefits. </p>
