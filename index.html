          <p>Xia Baolong, Beijing’s top official on Hong Kong affairs, strongly condemned the US tariffs on Hong Kong, claiming they aim to undermine the city’s existence, not just trade. Xia asserted that the US is targeting Hong Kong's survival, despite the city being a significant source of the US trade surplus. Some observers interpreted Xia's speech as a call to Hong Kong officials and businesses to unite with Beijing in the ongoing trade conflict with the US. This marks a notably harsher tone compared to previous statements, signaling heightened tensions between the regions.</p>

          <p>The escalating trade war between China and the United States is pushing the global economy towards recession, with neither side showing signs of de-escalation. While both countries have reasons to negotiate, neither wants to make the first move to avoid appearing weak. To break the deadlock, Beijing could invite the US to negotiate in China, or a neutral third party could broker a meeting during a regional summit. The US government has also barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chip to China, further escalating tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts report that Washington’s revised port-fee plan has lessened the pressure on China’s shipyards while increasing the burden on major shipping carriers. The finalized plan to charge Chinese-linked ships entering American ports includes a phased fee structure with exemptions, a significant change from the stricter original proposals. The most significant alteration for Chinese shipyards is the removal of fees based on the number of Chinese-made vessels in a company's fleet or orders placed with Chinese shipbuilders. This adjustment alleviates concerns for clients placing orders with Chinese shipbuilders, providing a boost to the industry.</p>

          <p>Communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India's West Bengal are being exploited for political gain by rival parties. Recent violence, stemming from an amendment to Waqf laws, has resulted in deaths, injuries, and property damage. The ruling TMC party accuses the BJP of orchestrating the violence, while the BJP alleges that Banerjee is leveraging the issue for political advantage. Experts suggest that West Bengal's history of political violence and intense competition between the TMC and BJP contribute to the volatile climate, particularly with upcoming state assembly elections in 2026.</p>

Harvard argues that the funding halt will impede critical research and innovation, while the Trump administration asserts that taxpayer funds are a privilege Harvard fails to meet basic conditions to access.</p>

          <p>The Republican Party's coalition is maintained by giving different factions what they want most: low taxes for the rich for traditional conservatives and a free hand to wield state power against their enemies for national conservatives. This authoritarian-libertarian synthesis is based on the belief that progressive taxation and the welfare state are the most sinister threats to liberty. Trump's trade war has tested this alliance, but abandoning tax cuts for the wealthy would shatter it. The party's stance on taxes is unlikely to change significantly.</p>

          <p>As part of negotiations over tariffs imposed by Washington, the Japanese government is contemplating increasing tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice. The proposal involves raising the amount imported from the United States to approximately 410,000 tons, up from the current 350,000 tons. This move comes amid growing calls for more affordable imported rice in Japan, where prices are surging due to supply shortages. The proposal aims to secure exemption from U.S. tariffs while balancing the impact on domestic farmers.</p>
