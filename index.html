          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of trade negotiations with Washington, potentially raising the amount from 350,000 tons to around 410,000 tons. This proposal aims to secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs and address rising rice prices in Japan due to supply shortages. While it could impact domestic farmers, the additional imports would fall within Japan's minimum access commitment. Economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa is expected to hold further talks with the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tariff announcements have triggered economic anxiety, with consumer confidence plummeting. Consumers are panic-buying products likely to face price hikes, while businesses anticipate a slowdown in production. The tariffs are having the opposite of their intended effect, as US manufacturing slows and economists express skepticism. The economic fallout highlights the risks of Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Japan is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of trade negotiations with the United States. The proposal involves increasing the amount imported from the U.S. to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons. Japan traditionally protects its domestic rice industry, but the government sees concessions as necessary to secure exemption from U.S. tariffs. The proposal also addresses growing calls for more affordable imported rice amidst domestic supply shortages.</p>
