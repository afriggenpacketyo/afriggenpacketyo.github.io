          <p>West Ham has hired former Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo as its new head coach, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. Nuno has signed a three-year contract with the club, which currently sits 19th in the Premier League table. The 51-year-old manager was sacked by Forest earlier in September, despite leading them to their highest league finish in nearly three decades last season. He expressed his pride in joining the club and stated his objective is to make the team as competitive as possible.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about a potential recession, the U.S. economy is showing surprising strength, largely powered by a resilient stock market that boosts consumer spending through the "wealth effect." However, this growth may be precarious, as the majority of stock market gains benefit the top 10% of earners, while broader consumer sentiment remains low. Economists warn that this reliance on market performance makes the economy highly vulnerable, as a significant downturn could quickly trigger a recession, especially with stagnant job growth.

          <p>Activist investment firm Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, arguing it is the best path forward for shareholders. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners, which led to the divestiture of Clear Channel's European assets, transforming it into a U.S.-focused company. Despite these changes, the company's stock has underperformed, and Anson believes a sale to a strategic acquirer or private equity would unlock more value than a slow, costly public market restructuring.

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is addressing the U.S. housing crisis by manufacturing homes in a factory, a process that can reduce costs by 20% and cut construction time in half. This method proved effective in providing rapid disaster relief housing for victims of the Maui wildfires, where the company built 82 homes in just two months. While modular construction currently represents a small fraction of the housing market, proponents argue its efficiency, quality control, and reduced waste offer a viable path to making homeownership more attainable for many Americans.</p>

          <p>Amid a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is developing advanced cockpit alert systems designed to give pilots critical extra seconds to avoid collisions at airports. The new technology, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), uses GPS data to provide automated audio and visual warnings if another aircraft is on the runway during takeoff or landing. Safety experts and the NTSB have been advocating for such systems to add another layer of protection in an increasingly congested aviation environment, with some airlines already adopting earlier versions of the technology.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered that a man was using their social media photos to create nonconsensual, explicit "deepfake" images on a "nudify" website called DeepSwap. Their experience exposed a significant legal gray area, as the creation of such content for personal use without distribution is not explicitly illegal in many places. This realization spurred them into activism, working with lawmakers to push for new legislation that holds AI companies accountable and criminalizes the creation, not just the dissemination, of such harmful material.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast groups Nexstar and Sinclair have resumed airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live" after a brief boycott, marking a retreat in their power struggle with ABC. The stations had initially pulled the show following pressure from the FCC over Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination, a move that seemed to assert their growing leverage over networks. However, the boycott proved more costly for the affiliates, who lost viewers to replacement programming and faced the network's potent threat of withholding valuable content like college football, demonstrating that networks still hold significant power.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after the Eaton fire destroyed thousands of structures in Altadena, California, the path to recovery is proving to be a slow and emotionally draining process for residents. Many homeowners who initially vowed to rebuild are now reconsidering due to widespread frustration with insurance disputes, bureaucratic delays, and the daunting prospect of living in a construction zone for years. This "dose of reality" has replaced early defiance, as survivors grapple with financial shortfalls, concerns over contamination, and the uncertainty of whether their community will ever be the same.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the enduring debate over free speech by revisiting the 1977 case where the ACLU defended a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a town with many Holocaust survivors. The author interviews the ACLU lawyer from the case, David Goldberger, who, despite finding the case personally painful, reaffirms the core constitutional principle. He argues that if speech can be denied simply because it is offensive, then any speech disliked by those in power could be suppressed, emphasizing that free speech must be protected even when we disagree with it.</p>

          <p>The recent federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey for making false statements to Congress could face significant legal challenges due to President Trump's long history of public attacks against him. Legal experts argue that Trump's repeated calls for Comey's prosecution and his celebratory comments following the indictment provide strong evidence for a defense motion to dismiss the case on grounds of selective or vindictive prosecution. The unusual circumstances, including the last-minute appointment of a new prosecutor and internal disagreement at the Justice Department, further complicate the government's case.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for high-skilled foreign workers is being criticized by economists as detrimental to the U.S. economy. Wharton School economist Britta Glennon argues the policy is based on the flawed belief that there is a fixed number of jobs, ignoring that skilled immigrants are highly innovative and entrepreneurial, often creating more jobs. She warns that such a high fee would disproportionately hurt startups and universities, and could drive U.S. companies to offshore jobs rather than hire American workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis of Kamala Harris's new book, "107 Days," argues that it reveals the steep challenges she faced in the 2024 presidential campaign but fails to acknowledge her own shortcomings. The author contends the book portrays Harris as indecisive, particularly in her choice of Tim Walz as a running mate, whom she now criticizes for his debate performance. The review suggests the memoir offers little coherent policy vision on key issues like immigration and inflation and avoids grappling with the role identity politics played in her defeat.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, prominent figures in the Trump administration and allied charismatic Christian movements are portraying the event not as a political act but as a battle in a "spiritual war." This rhetoric is rooted in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a movement that believes Christians are called to take dominion over all spheres of society and combat demonic forces. Leaders have cast Kirk as a "martyr of the third Great Awakening," mobilizing followers who see politics as a cosmic struggle between good and evil.</p>

In many low- and middle-income countries, informal operations crack open batteries and melt down the lead in unsafe conditions, releasing toxic dust that contaminates communities. Experts argue that this public health disaster can be solved through policy changes, such as removing taxes on scrap for formal recyclers and implementing "extended producer responsibility" laws that make manufacturers accountable for safe disposal.</p>

A more positive economic outlook from the OBR could reduce the pressure on the government to implement spending cuts or tax increases to address a potential fiscal gap.</p>
