        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Kingdom car production fell to its lowest level for the month of May since 1949, primarily due to the impact of new U.S. tariffs and ongoing factory retooling for electric vehicles. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported that output dropped by nearly a third compared to the previous year, with exports to the United States being halved. The tariffs prompted some UK manufacturers, including Jaguar Land Rover, to temporarily halt shipments. An agreement to reduce these tariffs is expected to be implemented soon, which the industry hopes will provide some relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified crackdown on immigration is causing significant concern among US businesses that rely on immigrant labor, with some already reporting workforce losses. The policy, which targets both undocumented workers and those with temporary protections, threatens to disrupt key sectors like cleaning, caregiving, and construction. Economists warn that shrinking the workforce could limit economic growth, fuel inflation by creating labor shortages, and transform the U.S. into a more stagnant economy. Business leaders argue that immigrant workers are essential for filling available jobs and that mass deportations would have far-reaching negative consequences.</p>

The Venezuelan government has initiated a special response plan to provide medical care, food, and essential supplies to those affected by the disaster.

          <p>Profits at China's major industrial firms experienced a sharp 9.1% year-on-year decline in May, the most significant drop since October of the previous year. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the slump to insufficient domestic demand, falling industrial product prices, and a deepening price war across various sectors. Despite a recent recovery in retail sales, businesses have struggled to translate this into higher profitability. The weak data adds to a mixed economic picture, but analysts suggest it may not be enough to prompt significant new stimulus from Beijing, which is tracking toward its annual GDP growth target.

While Kennedy did not mention President Trump by name, his remarks followed a series of presidential attacks on judges who have ruled against his administration.

The memorable event was not his famous solo try, but a powerful carry in the second Test where he lifted Australian player Israel Folau onto his back and used him to drive through the defensive line. North, now 33 and playing in France, recalls the moment with amusement, acknowledging it as the thing fans most remember. He fondly looks back on the 2013 tour as the peak of his career.</p>

The defendant, who was a student at the university, had claimed she was bullied by some students, though the court found no evidence that the victims were involved.

          <p>A year after a landslide election victory, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is navigating significant crises, marking a stormy end to its first year in office. The initial optimism has been replaced by challenges, including managing difficult domestic issues like the Southport riots and internal party tensions over the role of his former chief of staff, Sue Gray. While Starmer has earned praise for his pragmatic approach on the world stage, particularly in relations with the US and Europe, his government faces growing pressure at home. Recent poor local election results and a major rebellion over welfare reforms highlight the battle he faces to maintain authority and direction.</p>

          <p>The UK government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer has made a significant U-turn on its planned welfare state reforms following intense pressure and a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The proposed cuts, which were central to the government's fiscal policy, were met with widespread opposition within the party, culminating in a capitulation to avoid a parliamentary defeat. This reversal is seen as a major blow to the authority of both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, who had championed the changes as necessary for long-term fiscal sustainability.

While this approval from the central government's nuclear disaster prevention meeting is a significant milestone, the final decision to restart the reactors still requires consent from local residents. The plans were approved in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, moving the world's largest nuclear plant closer to resuming operations.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved evacuation plans for the area surrounding the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, a critical step toward potentially restarting the world's largest nuclear facility. The plant, operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company, has been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The approval of the disaster prevention plans by a government committee marks significant progress for the operator. However, the final hurdle remains securing consent from local residents in Niigata Prefecture, where the massive seven-reactor complex is located, before any restart can proceed.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil continues to stir debate, having outlasted Germany's own nuclear phase-out. Signed in 1975 between West Germany and Brazil's military dictatorship, the treaty aimed to build eight nuclear plants but has resulted in only one operational plant, Angra-2, and one unfinished site, Angra-3. Critics, including Germany's Green Party, have long called for its termination, citing safety concerns and the project's limited success. However, with nuclear power seeing a global resurgence and shifting politics in Germany, the future of the controversial half-century-old pact remains uncertain.</p>
