          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, have left Paul Weiss after the firm made a controversial agreement with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The agreement involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono services. The executive order from Trump criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz and for taking on a pro bono case involving the January 6 Capitol riot. Other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional, after Trump's apparent deals with Paul Weiss and other firms proved controversial in the legal community. </p>

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal connecting Jiangxi province, a rare earth hub, to Zhejiang, a wealthy coastal province. This mega-project aims to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with coastal hubs. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of $44.4 billion. The canal, designed as a Class III waterway, will accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, connecting Jiangxi's manufacturing sector with Zhejiang's seaports.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has significantly restricted press access inside the Pentagon, citing concerns about leaks of classified and unclassified information. These changes confine credentialed reporters to a limited area and require escorts for movement within the building. The Pentagon Press Association has criticized the move as an attack on press freedom. The new restrictions follow an investigation into multiple disclosures, including classified information about potential military actions regarding the Panama Canal. Hegseth's actions are seen as punitive, drawing comparisons to limited press access at the White House.</p>

          <p>The European Union is advocating for a trade agreement with the United States based on mutual respect rather than threats, following President Trump's proposal of a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized the EU's commitment to a beneficial deal and readiness to defend its interests. European governments have cautioned that higher tariffs would harm both sides, while negotiations remain the preferred path. President Trump has expressed impatience with ongoing EU-US trade negotiations, but European leaders warn that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides.</p>

Kim Jong Un blamed military officials for the incident, demanding repairs be completed before the communist Working Party's meeting in June.

The average rice price in Japanese supermarkets reached a record high, doubling last year's level due to a poor harvest and increased demand.

Meteorologists emphasize that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture, which cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar.

EU leaders and ministers echoed this sentiment, emphasizing de-escalation while preparing to respond. Talks between the US and EU have stumbled over issues such as food safety standards and digital services taxes.

          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn following President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Apple and the European Union. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all closed lower. Analysts attributed the market decline to uncertainty caused by the renewed tariff threats. Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on Apple if production isn't shifted to the U.S. caused Apple's stock to fall. Concerns over rising debt and ongoing tariff policies are creating volatility in both equity and bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The iconic singer was advised to refrain from performing and will undergo physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. NPH is a condition where fluid builds up in the brain, causing pressure on brain tissue. The condition is relatively uncommon and more likely to occur in older people, but is usually treatable with a surgical procedure to implant a shunt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued the administration, alleging the move violated the First Amendment and Due Process Clause. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a "critical step" to protect international students' rights. Harvard accused the administration of an "unprecedented and retaliatory attack" for supporting policies the administration dislikes.</p>
