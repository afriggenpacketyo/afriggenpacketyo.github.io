        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include higher initial government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale value, and the rapid pace of technological advancement in battery range and features. However, as more affordable EV models enter the market and the used EV supply grows, this depreciation gap could begin to narrow, making them more attractive to value-oriented used car buyers.</p>

          <p>Qualifying for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out most unsecured debts, is not guaranteed and depends heavily on an individual's financial situation. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares a filer's income to their state's median income; those earning below the median often qualify automatically. For higher earners, approval depends on demonstrating a lack of disposable income after accounting for necessary expenses. The article notes that factors like recent luxury purchases or dishonesty on paperwork can also lead to denial, while alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy exist for those who do not qualify.</p>

Customers reported being unable to access their reservations, check in for flights, or drop off bags, leading to some flight delays. The incident underscored the aviation industry's vulnerability to failures in third-party cloud infrastructure, echoing the severe travel chaos caused by a massive CrowdStrike outage in July 2024 that grounded thousands of flights and cost airlines hundreds of millions in revenue.</p>

          <p>In his first year as Indonesia's president, Prabowo Subianto has taken a notably active role on the global stage, making numerous diplomatic visits and engaging in major international issues. He has offered to send peacekeepers to Gaza and supported the U.S.-led peace plan, while also condemning Israel's actions at the UN. Domestically, his administration finalized a long-negotiated trade deal with the EU to boost economic growth. However, some analysts criticize his approach as "FOMO diplomacy," driven more by personal presence than a coordinated long-term strategy with his foreign ministry.</p>

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a Mexican cartel leader known as "El Gato," is facing a new federal charge of continuing a criminal enterprise, which makes him eligible for the death penalty. He is accused of orchestrating the 2013 murder-for-hire of a man in a Southlake, Texas, shopping center as an act of revenge against a rival cartel. After years on the FBI's most wanted list, Villareal-Hernandez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S., where he now faces multiple charges related to the high-profile killing.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is convening to finalize its next five-year plan, which is expected to prioritize industrial policy and investment in high-tech sectors like semiconductors to achieve technological sovereignty. This focus comes as Beijing navigates significant economic headwinds, including sputtering exports, a real estate crisis, and weak domestic consumption. While policymakers acknowledge the need to stimulate consumer spending, analysts believe the primary goal will be strengthening China's resilience against geopolitical pressures from the U.S., even if it means fewer resources are directed toward boosting household income.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's decision to stop using his royal titles has not quelled the public and political scrutiny over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There are ongoing calls for his titles, such as the Duke of York, to be formally and permanently removed through an act of Parliament. The pressure on the prince is compounded by new claims in a posthumously published memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with him, a claim he denies. The Royal Family is reportedly treating the ongoing situation with great concern.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the U.S. should expand Medicaid to cover GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic for the estimated 14 million eligible low-income Americans. While acknowledging the high initial cost to state budgets, it contends that the long-term benefits, including reduced healthcare spending on obesity-related diseases and improved longevity, justify the investment. The author suggests that costs are overstated, as Medicaid pays significantly less for drugs than private insurers, and prices are expected to fall as more competitors enter the market, making coverage both a moral and economically sound decision.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become more frequent over the past decade. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during funding gaps, but legal opinions from that era established the current practice of halting non-essential services. The article reviews the 14 previous shutdowns, noting that President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight, while the longest was a 34-day impasse in 2018 under President Trump. These events, often driven by partisan disputes over policy, have resulted in significant economic losses and disruptions for federal workers.</p>

          <p>While a short government shutdown is unlikely to severely impact U.S. air travel, a prolonged one could lead to significant disruptions. Most FAA and TSA employees are deemed essential and must work without pay, but extended shutdowns in the past have led to increased sick calls from unpaid staff. This can cause labor shortages, leading to longer security lines and flight delays, as seen during the 2018-2019 shutdown. Travel industry groups warn that a shutdown could also halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, exacerbating an existing shortage.</p>

          <p>As of October 20, 2025, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.37%, while a 15-year loan is at 5.80%. The article advises prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing to strengthen their credit profiles, as the best rates are typically offered to borrowers with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. It also emphasizes the importance of shopping around and comparing lenders to secure the most favorable terms. Despite rates being higher than in previous years, there are still opportunities to find affordable options in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks during the government shutdown, as the program is funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning some customer services could be impacted. According to the agency's contingency plan, services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards may be halted. The shutdown could also potentially delay the annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which is based on inflation data released by the Labor Department.</p>
