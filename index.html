            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Donald Trump's political pressure on Harvard University, demanding viewpoint diversity and faculty audits, is a misuse of the concept and an attempt to impose political authority over academic life. While viewpoint diversity is important, Trump's approach, which involves affirmative action for conservatives and abolishing other diversity policies, is contradictory and undermines scholarly objectivity. The author contends that fostering a richer culture of debate requires encouraging freedom of expression and the capacity to engage with different points of view, not through state mandates or bureaucratic procedures, which can further fragment intellectual discourse.</p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after a suspension that affected around 550,000 people. The suspension was due to track-switching work for a new route aimed at improving access to Haneda airport. East Japan Railway Co. carried out platform expansion work at Tamachi Station and relocated nearby tracks, with the new route scheduled to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031. This project aims to enhance transportation infrastructure and accessibility in Tokyo.</p>
