          <p>French asset manager Amundi has significantly scaled back its investments in China's September equity rally, reallocating funds towards dividend stocks due to ongoing concerns about the country's economic outlook and perceived overvaluations. Philippe d’Orgeval, the firm's deputy group chief investment officer, indicated that while future re-engagement is possible if conditions improve, the current macro environment offers less support for equity markets. This strategic shift by a firm managing €2.3 trillion reflects broader market skepticism regarding the sustainability of China's recent rebound, which was largely fueled by AI enthusiasm. The article underscores Amundi's prudent approach in navigating a volatile investment landscape, prioritizing safer plays amidst uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order committing the US to use all lawful and appropriate measures, including military action if necessary, to defend Qatar against external attack. This pledge, dated Monday but released Wednesday, aims to reassure Qatar following a recent Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Doha. The order cites the two nations' "close cooperation" and shared interests, declaring any armed attack on Qatar a threat to US peace and security. This unprecedented move underscores the strategic importance of Qatar, which hosts a major US military base, and comes after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed regret for the strike during a Washington visit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the first day of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration froze approximately $26 billion in funds designated for projects in Democratic-leaning states. This action specifically includes $18 billion for major transit projects in New York, home to top Democratic congressional leaders, and nearly $8 billion for green energy initiatives across 16 Democrat-run states. Critics, including Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, accused President Trump of using American citizens as "pawns" for partisan aims, warning that such moves could create a toxic environment in Congress. The article highlights a significant escalation of political tensions and the weaponization of federal funding during the ongoing shutdown.</p>

          <p>Brendan Carr, the pro-Trump chair of the Federal Communications Commission, has reportedly agreed to testify before the Senate commerce committee following Disney’s temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show. This development stems from Carr's public pressure on network affiliates to cease airing Kimmel's program, prompted by comments Kimmel made regarding the death of far-right pundit Charlie Kirk. The controversy led to a brief suspension and subsequent return of the show, along with sharp criticism from Senator Ted Cruz, who likened Carr's remarks to those of a "mafioso." The article details the political and media freedom implications of the incident.</p>

          <p>The White House has officially withdrawn the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a decision confirmed by an administration official who described Antoni as a "brilliant economist." Antoni was initially nominated in August after President Trump fired the previous BLS Commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that Trump publicly attributed to her. A fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, Antoni had previously voiced strong criticisms of the BLS and even suggested suspending its monthly jobs report. His withdrawal underscores the political tensions surrounding economic data reporting and key government appointments within the current administration.</p>

          <p>Amid the US government shutdown, a central dispute involves Democratic efforts to restore Medicaid eligibility for certain noncitizens, which Republican lawmakers have inaccurately framed as providing free healthcare to immigrants in the U.S. illegally. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" had previously restricted Medicaid access for lawful residents, refugees, and asylum seekers, and Democrats aim to reverse these cuts, potentially affecting 1.4 million individuals. While federal law prohibits Medicaid for those without legal status, this article clarifies that Democrats are advocating for healthcare for legally present individuals and for Affordable Care Act tax credits. The dispute highlights a deep partisan divide over immigration and healthcare funding.</p>

This strategic collaboration aims to significantly expand both companies' presence in the burgeoning South American market, with Chery expected to fully fund these ambitious projects.</p>

Her net worth, estimated between $9.4 million and $14.61 million, also includes multiple luxury properties.

Critics, including California Senator Adam Schiff, condemned the move as political retaliation, warning it would lead to higher energy prices and job losses.

          <p>Jake LaRavia, a 23-year-old wing, has joined the Lakers, with superstar LeBron James specifically highlighting his potential contribution alongside other key offseason acquisitions. LaRavia, a career 42.9% three-point shooter, aims to be a quiet connector and energy provider for the team, complementing stars like Luka Doncic. The Lakers, in need of "three-and-D" players, quickly signed LaRavia after his team option was not picked up by the Sacramento Kings.

          <p>Christa Gail Pike, 49, is scheduled for execution in Tennessee on September 30, 2026, marking the state's first execution of a woman in over 200 years.

Her attorneys argue that her young age and undiagnosed mental health issues at the time of the crime should warrant a life sentence without parole instead of the death penalty.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils, offering practical guidance on selecting healthy options and their appropriate culinary uses. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils, despite some negative press, are beneficial due to their low saturated fat content and high levels of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, containing minimal trans fats, making them suitable for a balanced diet. The article explains that extra virgin olive oil is best suited for salad dressings due to its low smoke point, while vegetable or sunflower oils are recommended for deep frying because they withstand higher temperatures without breaking down.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has dramatically escalated its drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in recent months, leading to significant fuel shortages and price increases in various parts of Russia. An analysis by BBC Verify and BBC Russian revealed that 21 out of 38 large refineries have been hit this year, with August and September seeing record attack levels, some targeting facilities deep inside Russia. These strikes, part of President Zelensky's strategy to pressure Russia, have forced at least 10 refineries to suspend operations, impacting national production. While the full economic impact on Russia's war funding remains unclear, the campaign is intensifying the pain of the protracted conflict.</p>

The article argues these settlements represent corporate cowardice and an effective admission that their post-insurrection content moderation decisions were flawed, signaling a pivot towards lighter moderation. This shift, exemplified by reinstating banned creators and loosening content rules, aligns with a broader trend among tech platforms to avoid difficult editorial decisions and embrace a "less responsible" stance on content.</p>
