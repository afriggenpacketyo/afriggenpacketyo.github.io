          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced a partnership with Miral to develop a new Disney theme park and resort on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. This will be Disney's seventh theme park destination, with Disney's Imagineers leading the creative design and operational oversight, but Miral will be fully developing and building the park. While Disney will not be investing capital in the project, it will benefit from royalties, and this project is separate from Disney's $60 billion investment in its theme parks over the next decade. The park's opening date is yet to be determined, but designs are already underway.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results revealed that while earnings per share surpassed expectations, revenue fell slightly short, leading to a drop in company shares. The ride-hailing giant reported a net income increase and growth in its mobility and delivery sectors, with monthly active platform consumers rising to 170 million. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted Uber's advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, noting a significant number of autonomous vehicle trips. The company is also facing an FTC lawsuit over its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi dismisses as unfounded, while also requiring employees to return to the office three days a week.</p>

          <p>Far-UVC light, a type of ultraviolet light that can kill airborne pathogens without harming humans, is emerging as a promising tool for preventing respiratory diseases and pandemics. Recent advancements include the development of cheaper and more efficient solid-state lamps using secondary harmonics, making far-UVC disinfection more accessible. While concerns about ozone production exist, new research suggests that moderate use and ceiling placement of far-UVC lamps can minimize air quality issues. Further research is needed, but the technology could potentially reduce the spread of childhood flus, tuberculosis, and pandemic viruses in the future.</p>

Those without acceptable identification may undergo an identity verification process, but those whose identities cannot be confirmed will not be allowed to pass through security, so travelers should arrive at least three hours before their flight.</p>

          <p>Many Afghans living in the U.S. are worried about being deported under President Trump's policies, fearing torture or death if returned to Afghanistan. With the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) approaching, thousands of Afghans face an uncertain future, despite some having aided U.S. forces and now holding legal permanent residency. Advocates and attorneys are urging the administration to reconsider the decision, citing the dangerous conditions in Afghanistan and the potential consequences for those who supported the U.S. mission.</p>

          <p>Following deadly militant attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, triggering a response from Pakistan. Pakistan labeled the strikes "unprovoked" and claimed to have shot down multiple Indian aircraft, while India stated it targeted terrorist infrastructure. The heightened tensions have prompted international concern and calls for restraint from both countries, while the root cause of the Kashmir conflict remains a contentious issue.</p>

These challenges include a stagnating economy, divisions over migration and defense spending, and the need to maintain unity within the coalition government. While the 500 billion euro infrastructure package is expected to remain intact, uncertainties surrounding other economic policies and potential clashes over the budget could hinder progress.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager, has proposed a change to the offside rule to benefit attacking players and increase goal-scoring opportunities. Wenger suggests that a player should only be considered offside if they are clearly ahead of the last defender, and in cases of doubt, the benefit should be given to the attacker. He compared the suggested change to a similar move taken after the 1990 World Cup.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff policy, initially met with alarm, has normalized smaller tariffs by threatening larger ones, a strategy that leverages the psychological effect of anchoring. While investors have shown some resilience to the initial shock, economists warn that the tariffs still in effect represent a significant tax increase for consumers. Despite the perception of lower tariffs as good news, the remaining tariffs still have the potential to harm businesses and the economy.</p>
