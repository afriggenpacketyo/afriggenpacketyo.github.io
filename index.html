        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEOs of NPR and PBS, Katherine Maher and Paula Kerger, respectively, are exploring ways to challenge the Trump administration's executive order aimed at cutting off public funding to their news and media organizations. Maher mentioned that potential funding cuts would disproportionately affect local stations and their audiences, especially in rural communities where access to local news is already limited. Kerger emphasized that they have never faced such a circumstance before and will vigorously push back against the cuts. The CEOs believe that federal funding is crucial for journalists covering local communities and preventing the further spread of news deserts across the nation.</p>

          <p>California's ambitious high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled cost estimates, raising questions about the country's ability to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. The article follows eminent-domain lawyer Mark Wasser as he visits construction sites and clients whose land has been acquired for the rail line, which currently aims to connect Bakersfield and Merced by 2033. Wasser disputes claims that eminent domain is the primary cause of delays, arguing that design changes and other issues are more significant factors. The project has disrupted farmland and local communities, leaving farmers with unusable remnants and altering established infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed questions about defying the Supreme Court regarding the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Trump stated he is relying on Attorney General Pam Bondi to determine the legality of ordering Abrego Garcia's return. When questioned about Secretary of State Marco Rubio's view on due process for citizens and non-citizens, Trump admitted, "I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know." Further pressed on upholding the Constitution, Trump deferred to his lawyers, stating they would follow the Supreme Court's guidance.

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up reservists to intensify and expand operations in Gaza, aiming to pressure Hamas for hostage release and defeat the group. Critics argue the offensive has failed to secure hostage releases and question Prime Minister Netanyahu's objectives. The military plans to operate in new areas, destroying infrastructure above and below ground. This escalation follows failed international negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release. Aid agencies report severe shortages of food, water, and medicine due to an Israeli blockade, raising concerns of war crimes. The move increases pressure on reservists and hostage families, who urge a deal with Hamas.</p>

          <p>The Guardian's editorial condemns Israel's aid blockade of Gaza, calling it a use of hunger as a weapon of war. The piece references proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding whether Israel must allow aid into Gaza, where supplies are dwindling and thousands of children face acute malnutrition. The editorial highlights statements from Israeli officials suggesting a policy of withholding humanitarian aid and argues that this constitutes a war crime. It criticizes the proposed alternative aid delivery mechanism, which excludes the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and urges international pressure for the immediate resumption of aid.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that President Trump's expansion of executive power is not merely an extension of the unitary executive theory but is rooted in a longer tradition of right-wing thought favoring monarchical rule. The article traces the intellectual lineage from Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss to the Claremont Institute and Adrian Vermeule, highlighting their critique of liberalism and emphasis on decisive executive action. It warns that Trump's actions, such as deploying the military to the border and disregarding federal judges, threaten to transform the presidency into a dictatorial office, urging a return to constitutional constraints and the importance of character in leadership.</p>

          <p>After Bayer Leverkusen's historic unbeaten season, Bayern Munich has won back the Bundesliga title, marking their 33rd overall. The article attributes the win to Vincent Kompany's steadying influence as coach, key signings like Harry Kane and Michael Olise, and Leverkusen's inability to sustain their previous season's performance. Kompany's positive relationships with players and effective handling of internal pressures were crucial, while Kane's goal-scoring prowess and Olise's creativity added new dimensions to Bayern's attack. Bayern's strength in depth also allowed them to overcome injuries to key players, ultimately securing the title with one game to spare.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not rule out using military force to gain control of Greenland, an autonomous territory within Denmark. He also mentioned the possibility of annexing Canada, suggesting that the border between the two countries is merely an artificial line. Trump claimed that the U.S. subsidizes Canada to a significant extent and expressed a desire to discuss making Canada the 51st state with the new Prime Minister, Mark Carney. These statements have sparked widespread condemnation and unease in both Greenland and Canada.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies the Most Damaging Phrase in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 12:50:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" is highly detrimental to relationships. This comparison, whether to an ex, friend, or past version of oneself, conveys a message of inadequacy and undermines a partner's sense of worth. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of open communication or uncertainty about the relationship. Instead of making comparisons, the psychologist recommends clearly communicating needs and frustrations to foster a healthier and more secure relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China, acknowledging that current high levies have significantly reduced trade between the two nations. He noted economic challenges in China, including a contraction in factory activity. While praising some recent statements from China as "positive," Trump reiterated that any trade agreement must be "fair." This suggests a potential shift in trade policy, with Trump considering a reduction in tariffs to facilitate renewed economic engagement with China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly scrapped over $800 million in research funding for LGBTQ health, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. The decision aligns with the administration's opposition to diversity programs and gender-affirming care, leading to the termination of grants at various institutions. Critics argue the cuts reflect ideological bias and disregard for scientific evidence, while scientists express concern about the impact on LGBTQ health and the potential for new outbreaks. The move has been described as creating a hierarchy of patients and undermining efforts to address health disparities within the LGBTQ community.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea of retrofitting existing single-family homes into multi-unit dwellings as a potential solution to the affordable housing crisis. With a shortage of millions of homes and rising construction costs, developers and policymakers are looking at ways to utilize the existing housing stock more efficiently. Examples include converting homes into "roommate houses" and adding accessory dwelling units (ADUs) like backyard cottages. These efforts aim to add housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption and can provide homeowners with additional income or housing options for family members.</p>
