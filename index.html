        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Starmer, is beginning discussions to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected and have no further appeal options in the UK. This initiative, announced during Starmer's visit to Albania, aims to process asylum seekers abroad after their claims are denied in the UK. While the government has not disclosed which countries are involved in the talks, previous reports suggest a focus on the western Balkans. Starmer emphasized that these return hubs are not a singular solution but part of a broader strategy to combat organized crime and illegal immigration, particularly to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.</p>

          <p>Former MLB pitcher Trevor Bauer has publicly questioned the league's decision to reinstate Pete Rose while he remains sidelined due to past sexual assault allegations. Bauer, currently playing in Japan, implied that MLB's decision might be influenced by factors beyond guilt or innocence, suggesting that his inability to sign with an MLB team is due to MLB's interference, not a lack of talent. MLB maintains that Bauer is eligible to sign with any team, having served his suspension related to the allegations. Bauer was never charged with a crime, and a restraining order against him was denied.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations will meet in Istanbul for the first direct talks since the early stages of Russia's invasion in 2022, although President Putin will not be attending despite an invitation from Zelenskyy. These talks, facilitated by Turkey, aim to find a path toward peace amidst the ongoing conflict, with Zelenskyy expressing readiness to make decisions leading to a just resolution. President Trump has expressed hope for progress and hinted at potentially traveling to Istanbul.

          <p>China has launched the first satellites for its Three-Body Computing Constellation, a project to create a supercomputer in orbit. The constellation, developed by Zhejiang Lab, aims to provide real-time data processing with a computing capacity of 1,000 peta operations per second. This space-based system could rival the most powerful ground-based supercomputers. Space historian Jonathan McDowell notes the growing trend of cloud computing in space, highlighting the potential for orbital data centers to use solar power and efficiently radiate heat, reducing energy needs and carbon footprints.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a drop following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, which fell short of expectations for both revenue and net income. Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, investors were hoping that investments in artificial intelligence and the core e-commerce business would drive stronger results. The company is navigating macroeconomic uncertainties, including the trade war between Washington and Beijing, which has impacted consumer sentiment in China. Alibaba is also facing intense competition in the Chinese e-commerce market, leading to a price war with rivals.</p>

          <p>Following the end of the civil war, displaced Syrian families are returning to their native city of Homs, facing the enormous challenge of rebuilding their lives amidst widespread destruction. Fatima Hazzouri, who spent 13 years away from Homs due to the conflict, returned with other families from the north, where they lived in tents and makeshift shelters. While the lifting of US sanctions offers hope for economic revival, the city still lacks essential services, and many homes remain in ruins. Providing jobs and rebuilding infrastructure are key tasks for Syria's new rulers, as they strive to resettle millions of displaced people.</p>

The disciplinary measures often went beyond the schools' own rules, with some students facing suspensions and censorship for expressing their views.

          <p>President Trump's new approach to Israel seems like a mirror image of his predecessor's, as he has little interest in restraining or pressuring Israel on its war in Gaza, but perhaps even less interest in supporting Israel on wider regional issues or aligning the two countriesâ€™ approach to the region. The Trump administration has been in direct talks with three of Israelâ€™s main adversaries â€” Hamas, Iran, and the Houthis â€” to cut deals without Israelâ€™s input, a nearly unprecedented situation according to longtime observers of relations between the two countries. This shift reflects a changing GOP and a changing Middle East, where traditional alliances are being re-evaluated.</p>
