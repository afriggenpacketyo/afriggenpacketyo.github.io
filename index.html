          <p>Intel's CFO David Zinser announced the semiconductor giant received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, part of a deal where the White House plans to take a 10% stake in the company. Zinser also indicated Intel might seek external investment for its foundry business, despite reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the deal is still being finalized by the Department of Commerce, while Intel had previously warned of potential "adverse reactions" from stakeholders regarding the government's involvement. This strategic investment aims to bolster domestic chip manufacturing capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending the "de minimis" rule, which previously allowed U.S. consumers to import up to $800 worth of goods free of tariffs and duties. This change is projected to increase prices for inexpensive online purchases, particularly impacting lower-income households and potentially causing short-term shortages. While the administration cites reasons like limiting counterfeits and increasing tax revenue, economists warn of significant price hikes on various imported goods. The move could also create administrative burdens and has already led some international postal services to suspend shipments to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

This move signifies a growing competitive dynamic between Microsoft, a major OpenAI investor, and the AI startup itself, which has recently diversified its cloud providers. The new model, refined using Nvidia GPUs, is being evaluated on LMArena, with Microsoft planning to integrate it into Copilot for text-based applications.

The family's independent investigation, including digital evidence and a possible connection to Kohberger's Instagram, continues to seek answers.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is transferring detainees from Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz," a controversial state-run immigration facility, after a federal judge ordered parts of its operations to cease. The administration criticized the "activist judge" but is complying, moving individuals to other detention centers. This facility, part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand detention capacity with state partnerships, faced allegations of inhumane conditions from advocates. The judge's ruling cited environmental law violations, halting new construction and transfers, though Florida's government has appealed the decision.</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation announced it will reclaim direct management of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, a major transportation hub and national landmark.

While the city's mayor supports federal investment for needed repairs, the administration is shelving a prior expansion plan due to its cost. The federal government will now focus on immediate infrastructure needs and maximizing commercial revenue for reinvestment.</p>

The move has drawn strong criticism from the newspaper's editor, who called it a "direct attack on the free press" and a threat to accountability.

          <p>UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has announced his boycott of an upcoming state banquet for Donald Trump, citing the dire situation in Gaza, and has personally informed King Charles of his decision. Davey believes Trump possesses the unique power to halt the "horrible famine" and secure hostage releases by pressuring Israeli and Qatari leaders. He emphasized that his refusal is not political posturing but a necessary act to convey Trump's moral responsibility regarding the humanitarian crisis. This article highlights a significant diplomatic protest and calls for U.S. intervention in the Middle East conflict.</p>
