          <p>A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a shooting at the Mango nightclub in Birmingham injured four people. The incident, which occurred around 3:00 AM BST, left one man in critical condition. West Midlands Police have also taken three women into custody on suspicion of violent disorder related to the event. Authorities have cordoned off Bristol Street, a major city route, and are appealing to the public for any information, including dashcam or mobile phone footage from inside or near the venue at the time of the shooting.</p>

          <p>Former Labour MP Zarah Sultana has accused Jeremy Corbyn and other members of the new left-wing "Your Party" of making "baseless attacks" on her character and is now consulting defamation lawyers. The dispute stems from an email Sultana sent soliciting party memberships, which Corbyn and four other independent MPs publicly disavowed as "unauthorised." This public falling-out reveals significant internal divisions within the fledgling political party ahead of its founding conference. Sultana alleges she has been sidelined in a "sexist boys' club" and maintains her actions were aligned with the party's established plans.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that President Trump's second-term agenda, focused on economic growth and conservative policies, is being systematically undermined by "lawfare" from Democratic trial lawyers. The author points to legal opposition against executive orders aimed at expanding 401(k) investment options, increasing domestic energy production, and streamlining the federal workforce. These legal actions are framed as attempts to subvert the electoral will of American voters for political and financial gain. The piece calls for the Trump administration to counter these efforts through strong rulemaking to ensure his policies are implemented.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, issuing letters to California, New York, and Illinois demanding they honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has warned that non-compliance could lead to lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice and the potential withholding of federal funding. The administration argues that sanctuary policies release dangerous individuals into communities, while the states maintain their laws, which limit cooperation without a judicial warrant, are necessary to build trust between law enforcement and immigrant populations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline to ensure a car purchase is affordable and to avoid owing more than the vehicle is worth. This framework recommends a down payment of at least 20%, financing the car for no more than four years, and ensuring total monthly vehicle expenses do not exceed 10% of your gross income. While acknowledging that high car prices can make these targets challenging, financial planners emphasize that adhering to them helps prioritize saving for appreciating assets over a depreciating one like a car.

          <p>Palestinian health officials report that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City have killed at least 14 people overnight, including six members of one family. The strikes come as Israel intensifies its military offensive in the area, urging hundreds of thousands of residents to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone in the south. The ongoing operation complicates ceasefire efforts, with aid groups warning that the forced displacement will worsen an already severe humanitarian crisis. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 65,100 since the conflict began, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws a historical parallel between the Nazi party's response to the 1933 Reichstag fire and the Trump administration's reaction to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The author argues that, just as the Nazis used the fire as a pretext to suspend civil liberties and crush political opposition, the Trump administration is using Kirk's death to justify a massive repression of the political left. The article cites threats against media outlets and non-profit organizations as evidence of an unprecedented assault on American democratic norms, warning that history teaches how authoritarians exploit crises to seize power.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a compelling framework for understanding the U.S.-China rivalry, contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He argues that while China has achieved remarkable progress in physical infrastructure and manufacturing, its focus on national power often comes at the expense of individual happiness, contributing to issues like high youth unemployment. Conversely, Wang suggests the U.S. has become physically stagnant and overly procedural. He provocatively proposes that it is time for the U.S. to learn from some of China's successes in dynamism and industrial policy.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting software from Collins Aerospace has caused significant disruptions and delays at major European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the 'Muse' software, which manages electronic check-in and baggage systems for multiple airlines, forced airport staff to resort to manual processing. This led to long queues, with hundreds of passengers affected, and prompted Brussels Airport to request airlines to cancel half of their flights. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected global aviation industry to digital system failures, creating a cascading effect of delays and missed connections across the continent.</p>

In response, groups are advising staff to exercise caution while documenting raids and assisting immigrants, but maintain they will not be intimidated or surrender their First Amendment rights.

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are not just a delicacy but a vital food staple, providing essential protein and vitamins. In the markets of Kinshasa, these insects are sold fresh or fried as a popular snack and meal component, often seen as a more accessible and organic alternative to expensive meat. Villagers harvest the insects from forests, and some NGOs are now farming them commercially to supply orphanages and meet growing demand. This traditional practice, which has expanded in recent decades, offers a sustainable solution to food scarcity in the region.</p>

          <p>A dramatic, youth-led protest movement in Nepal successfully forced the resignation of the government, leading to the appointment of Sushila Karki as the nation's first female prime minister. The upheaval was fueled by widespread anger over government corruption and unemployment, which was amplified by a social media campaign highlighting the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children. The protests escalated into deadly violence after the government suspended most social media platforms, culminating in Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli's resignation. This event underscores a broader trend of generational change and political unrest shaking South Asia.</p>

          <p>Athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including British 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, have raised concerns about the logistical challenges posed by the warm-up facilities. The main warm-up track is located at Yoyogi Park, a 15-minute bus journey from the main stadium, forcing competitors to begin their preparations nearly two hours before their events. Hodgkinson described the situation as "draining." World Athletics president Lord Coe acknowledged the location is "not perfect," explaining that the track used during the Olympics was no longer available, but stated that organizers have done everything possible to mitigate the issue.</p>

          <p>Syria is preparing for its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad dictatorship, employing a complex, indirect voting process due to the country's fragile state. Instead of a direct public vote, an 11-member Supreme Committee will appoint local sub-committees, which in turn will select thousands of electors to form an "electoral college." This college will then vote for 121 members of the new People's Assembly. Another 70 members will be directly appointed by the interim president, raising concerns among critics about the potential for manipulation and the concentration of power, despite the process including some measures for diversity and oversight.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is set to implement a significant change in its media policy, requiring all journalists covering the Department of Defense to sign a new pledge. Under this policy, reporters must agree not to gather any information, including unclassified material, that has not been officially authorized for public release. According to U.S. officials, journalists who refuse to sign the pledge or violate its terms will have their press credentials revoked. This move would effectively cut off their access to the headquarters of the largest department within the U.S. government, raising concerns about press freedom and transparency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for the H-1B visa program on behalf of skilled foreign workers. The administration states the measure is intended to curb alleged "abuse" of the program and encourage the hiring of American workers. This move represents a drastic increase from the previous administrative fees and is expected to price out many small businesses and startups that rely on the program to attract top talent. Major tech companies, the largest beneficiaries of the program, are reportedly advising employees currently abroad to return to the U.S. before the order takes effect.</p>

          <p>The death of a rare pygmy sperm whale near the island of Utila, Honduras, is highlighting the devastating impact of plastic pollution on marine life. Researchers found the young whale in distress after it repeatedly beached itself. A subsequent necropsy revealed an 11-inch plastic bag lodged in its stomach, which likely contributed to a fatal digestive blockage. This incident is particularly tragic as it marks the first confirmed record of this elusive species in Utila. The event serves as a stark reminder that an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and over one million seabirds die each year from ingesting or becoming entangled in plastic waste.</p>

To combat this, a new pilot program called Project Franklin is pairing volunteer cybersecurity experts from the DEF CON hacker community with operators of critical infrastructure, like a small water facility in Vermont.

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book "Smitten" explores the concept of "limerence," a state of profound romantic infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts and extreme emotional highs and lows. While this state can be a natural part of falling in love, it can become a form of addiction if the object of affection is unavailable or unreliable, leading to anxiety and craving. Bellamy offers strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact, consciously turning positive daydreams into negative scenarios, and redirecting energy toward new personal goals. The key is to recognize the obsession as an internal process that can be managed and overcome.</p>

          <p>Turkey's government is facing criticism for an increasing crackdown on female artists, with the girl band Manifest being the latest target of a criminal investigation for "indecent and immoral acts." This follows a pattern where pro-government media and officials target female musicians, writers, and artists for performances or statements deemed to violate conservative moral values, often leading to arrests and cancellations. Critics and feminist historians argue this is part of a broader political strategy by the ruling AKP party to use religion to secure power, silence dissent, and enforce patriarchal norms, undermining the freedom of expression for women in the country.</p>

Leader Sir Ed Davey's playful and unconventional stunts, such as bungee-jumping and jet-skiing, successfully garnered media attention and helped the party win seats. However, new polling suggests that a majority of voters, including many Lib Dem supporters, now view these antics as making the party look less serious. The party must now decide how to build on its success, expand its policy platform beyond care issues, and define its identity to appeal to more voters without relying solely on stunts.</p>

Berlin has stated it will not join this initiative in the short term, arguing that recognition should be the final step of a peace process, a stance critics call unrealistic. This position is rooted in Germany's historical responsibility for Israel's security, which Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called a matter of "reason of state." However, pressure is mounting both internationally and domestically for Germany to take a stronger stance and potentially support sanctions against Israel amid the escalating Gaza war.</p>
