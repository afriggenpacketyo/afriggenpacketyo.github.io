          <p>A federal appeals court has partially granted a stay, allowing the Trump White House to restrict Associated Press (AP) access to spaces like the Oval Office. The court's decision temporarily blocks a lower court ruling that deemed the ban unconstitutional, arguing these spaces are not public forums. The ruling permits the White House to selectively admit journalists based on viewpoint, citing presidential independence. The AP, which reaches billions daily, sued after being denied access for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America in its Stylebook. The White House plans to expand access to new media outlets. The tone of the article is neutral, reporting on the legal back-and-forth and the White House's stance.</p>

          <p>Chicago police are investigating the death of Officer Krystal Rivera, who was shot while conducting an investigatory stop in Chatham. Rivera and her partner pursued a suspect into an apartment where they encountered a second person with a rifle. During the encounter, a weapon was discharged, and Rivera was struck, later dying at the hospital. The vehicle transporting her to the hospital caught fire due to a mechanical issue, further complicating the situation. The investigation is ongoing, with three weapons recovered from the scene, but it is still unclear who fired the fatal shot. The incident is a tragic loss for the Chicago Police Department, especially the 6th District, which recently lost another officer in November 2024.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador nearly four months ago. An indictment unsealed on Friday shows Abrego Garcia facing charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people. Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that the case is about upholding constitutional rights, not about the individual. ICE admitted Abrego Garcia's deportation was due to an administrative error, and a federal judge and the Supreme Court ordered his return. The Trump administration has alleged Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, allegations his attorneys deny.</p>

Given the lack of options, manager Clarke may consider Jon McLaughlin, a two-time Scotland cap, or other Scotland-based options like Scott Bain or Ross Doohan.

There were 17 outbreaks linked to farms in England and Wales in 2024, with a recent outbreak in South Wales affecting dozens. Inspection reports reveal some farms have repeatedly ignored health inspectors' advice, allowing children to handle sick animals in unsanitary conditions. Cryptosporidium can cause severe symptoms, particularly affecting the young, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. The organizers of Open Farm Sunday assert that participating farms maintain high health and safety standards.</p>

          <p>An executive order issued by Donald Trump imposing sanctions that target the work of the International Criminal Court (I.C.C.) is being challenged in court. The order singles out the court’s chief prosecutor for sanctions and forbids the provision of “services” to the prosecutor’s office, punishable by fines or prison.
