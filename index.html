          <p>Manchester United is contemplating whether to sell or continue supporting forward Alejandro Garnacho, whose performance has declined since scoring against Manchester City earlier in the season. After a promising start, Garnacho's form dipped, leading to questions about his attitude and commitment. While head coach Ruben Amorim initially addressed the issue, Garnacho's continued presence in the squad suggests the matter has been resolved. However, his recent performances have sparked fan discussions about his future with the club, as he has only scored one goal in his last 21 appearances.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Britain should not be intimidated by Donald Trump's trade policies but instead should collaborate with other nations to uphold a rules-based global trading system. The author suggests that Britain should work with the G7 (excluding the US), the EU, and Asia to create a new global trade order. Mark Carney, if elected as Canadian prime minister, is seen as pivotal in this effort, aiming to re-orient Canada around this new order. The author emphasizes the need for Britain to make a choice between adhering to Trump's framework or creating a fresh approach that benefits Britain, the world, and potentially the US.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier reportedly explored an alternative route to the east of Taiwan before a recent drill, according to military analysts. The warship appears to have bypassed wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, instead transiting through narrower passages in the Philippine archipelago. This move suggests the PLA is training to counter American warships and exploring alternative routes in case of a conflict over Taiwan. Analysts note that this new route could provide the PLA with southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, a strategic chokepoint.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has acknowledged that its soldiers made errors in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. While insisting that at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, the IDF admits they were unarmed when soldiers opened fire. Mobile phone footage from one of the paramedics contradicted Israel's initial claim that the convoy approached suspiciously without lights. Israel now admits its earlier account was inaccurate and attributes the report to the troops involved.</p>

          <h2>Mark Cuban Warns Trump's Tariff Plan Could Lead to Economic Crisis Worse Than 2008</h2>

          <p>Mark Cuban has cautioned that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies, coupled with DOGE cuts (likely referring to cuts in government spending or personnel), could trigger a long-term economic crisis surpassing the severity of the 2008 financial crisis. Cuban suggests that the combination of inflationary tariffs and workforce reductions in federal agencies could have dire consequences. He points to the 2008 crisis, which saw a significant decline in GDP, a surge in unemployment, and a housing market crash, as a benchmark for potential economic fallout.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported cars have led automakers to take various actions, including job cuts, shipment pauses, and price adjustments. Stellantis announced temporary layoffs at factories in Michigan and Indiana, while Jaguar Land Rover paused shipments to the U.S. Hyundai reported record sales, possibly due to buyers anticipating higher prices, and Ferrari increased prices on some models. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has caused automakers to approach the situation differently, with potential price increases and adjustments expected in the coming months.</p>

          <p>A mother's death from cervical cancer was caused by errors in NHS cancer screening reports, with her family receiving an undisclosed payout. Louise Gleadell's cervical screening results were misreported as negative in both 2008 and 2012, leading to a delayed diagnosis and ultimately her death at 38. An internal review revealed the samples were inadequate for reliable results, but neither Ms. Gleadell nor her family were informed while she was alive. The NHS trust has apologized for its mistakes, acknowledging the devastating consequences.</p>
