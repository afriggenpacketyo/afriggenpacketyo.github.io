        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump asserted that his administration's deployment of federal officers was the primary reason for a recent decrease in crime in Memphis, Tennessee. This claim comes as his administration considers deploying the National Guard to the city, which has faced high rates of violent crime. While some Republican officials in Tennessee, including the governor, have welcomed the potential federal intervention, local Democratic leaders have expressed strong opposition. They argue such a move would be anti-democratic and could instill fear within vulnerable communities, potentially harming the state's reputation for generations.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, though a clear motive remains under investigation. Utah's governor stated the suspect was influenced by "leftist ideology," while reports indicate his parents are registered Republicans and that he lived with a transgender roommate, a community Kirk often criticized. The lack of a confirmed motive has fueled intense political debate across the United States, with public figures offering conflicting interpretations of the tragedy. The event highlights the nation's deep political divisions and the rush to frame violence within partisan narratives.</p>

          <p>A London march organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew a crowd estimated between 110,000 and 150,000 people, significantly exceeding expectations. The event, focused on themes of free speech and anti-migration, turned violent when some attendees clashed with police officers separating them from a smaller counter-protest. Twenty-six officers were injured, some seriously, and at least 25 arrests were made for offenses including violent disorder. The rally featured speeches from European far-right figures and a video appearance by Elon Musk, who criticized the UK government's policies on migration, reflecting growing nationalist sentiments in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools are reporting a significant increase in students suffering from emotionally based school avoidance (EBSA), a condition where attending school becomes too traumatic for a child. This article highlights the story of one mother who regrets pushing her autistic daughter to attend school until she experienced a mental breakdown, including self-harm and night terrors. Educators link the post-pandemic spike in EBSA to heightened anxiety among teenagers, exacerbated by social media pressures and sensory overload in busy school environments. The issue is contributing to high rates of persistent absenteeism, prompting calls for more inclusive, supportive school systems rather than punitive attendance policies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. official confirmed that Coast Guard personnel, operating from the Navy destroyer USS Jason Dunham, boarded and searched a Venezuelan fishing boat for illegal drugs. The inspection was part of the U.S. military's ongoing "counter narco-terror operations" in the Caribbean and was reportedly initiated based on a tip. The search did not yield any contraband, and the U.S. official stated the event occurred in international waters.

          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting to circumvent legal protections for asylum seekers by deporting a group of non-Ghanaian African migrants to Ghana. The judge expressed concern that Ghana intends to return these individuals to their home countries, where they face credible threats of persecution or torture, which would violate U.S. and international law. Attorneys for the migrants argue they are being held in poor conditions and that the deportations represent an "end-run" around their legal safeguards. The judge ordered the government to explain its actions, highlighting a significant legal and ethical challenge to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a controversial bill, SB 237, designed to stabilize the state's energy market by allowing up to 2,000 new oil wells annually in Kern County. This measure, part of a deal brokered by state leaders, aims to address concerns over rising gas prices and the planned closure of two refineries. In exchange for the increased onshore production, the bill imposes stricter regulations on offshore drilling and extends the state's cap-and-trade climate program. While proponents argue it's a necessary step for affordability, environmental groups and some progressive Democrats have criticized it as a concession to the oil industry.</p>

These projects are critical as the canal, a vital artery for global trade and the U.S. economy, is entirely dependent on rainfall for its operations.

          <p>The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks to set their own limits for contactless card payments, potentially removing the current £100 cap. Academics and economists warn this could lead to a rise in spontaneous and debt-fueled spending, as the need to enter a PIN serves as an important "friction point" for consumers. While proponents argue the change aligns card technology with unlimited mobile payments and offers consumer choice, critics raise concerns about security and the potential for economic abuse.

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a landmark lawsuit against the state of Maryland for underfunding its historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has died at 81. His 15-year legal battle resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's colleagues remembered him as a visionary "armed with history" who tirelessly fought for equity in higher education. During his tenure from 1984 to 2010, he oversaw a period of significant growth at Morgan State, and his work brought national attention to funding disparities faced by HBCUs across the country.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new signing, Nick Woltemade, made an immediate impact by scoring the winning goal just 29 minutes into his debut against Wolves. The 6-foot-6 German striker's powerful header secured a crucial 1-0 victory for the team, which had struggled for goals in its opening games. Woltemade's performance was particularly timely, as the club revealed that fellow new forward Yoane Wissa is sidelined with an injury. Despite having only a few training sessions with his new team, Woltemade showed creative flashes and provided a much-needed offensive spark, earning a standing ovation from the home crowd.</p>

          <p>On the television show "The View," co-host Whoopi Goldberg criticized the Democratic party for its public handling of former President Joe Biden's perceived decline. She argued that if concerns had been addressed "in-house" instead of becoming a "public spectacle," the situation would have been better for the party. Her comments were made during a discussion about an excerpt from former Vice President Kamala Harris's new book, in which Harris reportedly described Biden's decision to run for re-election as "reckless." Goldberg suggested that internal party disputes being aired publicly contributed to negative outcomes for Democrats.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government has strongly condemned the United States after accusing the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Jason Dunham of illegally detaining a civilian fishing boat for eight hours. Caracas claims the incident, in which 18 armed personnel boarded the vessel, occurred within its exclusive economic zone and constituted a hostile "direct provocation." Venezuela's foreign ministry asserted that the action was an attempt to escalate tensions in the Caribbean to justify regime change. The accusation marks a further deterioration in relations as the U.S. continues its military patrols in the region to counter drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>According to leaked military planning documents, the Trump administration has drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops for law enforcement operations in the state's urban areas. The plan, which would supplement local police in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge, reportedly hinges on a request from the state's Republican governor. This potential deployment is part of the administration's broader focus on crime in cities, a strategy that has drawn criticism from Democratic leaders who view it as a political show of force. The Pentagon has not confirmed the plan, stating that leaked documents should not be interpreted as official policy.</p>

          <p>A staffer for Mexico's ruling Morena party, Salvador Ramírez, has resigned after making controversial comments on a major news program about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During the broadcast, Ramírez suggested Kirk received "a spoonful of his own chocolate" due to his pro-gun stance. The remarks drew sharp condemnation, including a warning from a U.S. State Department official about visa revocations for foreigners who glorify violence. The news network, Milenio, issued a public apology, and Ramírez later resigned, becoming one of several individuals to face professional consequences for commentary following Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Two separate tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down in rural San Juan County, Utah, on Saturday afternoon before tracking northeast into Colorado. The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for the area, citing a confirmed tornado near Montezuma Creek and a second radar-indicated tornado east of Monticello. The storms produced large hail and warnings of flying debris, though they moved through largely unpopulated areas. While Utah averages only about two tornadoes per year, these events mark the second and third tornadoes recorded in the state for 2025, following a fire-induced tornado in July.</p>

          <p>A recent barrage of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City has killed at least 32 people, including 12 children, according to medical staff at Shifa Hospital. Israel has escalated its offensive in the area, which it describes as Hamas's last major stronghold, and has urged the hundreds of thousands of remaining residents to evacuate. The strikes have destroyed multiple high-rise buildings that Israel claims were used by Hamas for surveillance. Meanwhile, the families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas rallied in Tel Aviv, criticizing the government's military approach as counterproductive to securing the release of their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Authorities revealed that bullet casings found at the scene of Charlie Kirk's shooting featured engravings with references to internet memes, video games, and anti-fascist culture. The messages included the emoticon "OwO" from furry subculture, the button sequence for a bomb in the game Helldivers 2, and lyrics from the anti-fascist anthem "Bella Ciao." Experts caution against drawing definitive conclusions about the suspect's motive from these "extremely online" references, as they are often used ironically or as bait to generate media attention. They suggest the engravings clearly indicate the shooter desired notoriety and wanted the act to be widely discussed online.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin is under intense scrutiny from fans and potentially the board after a 2-0 home defeat to Hearts left the team with a five-game winless streak to start the season. The result, which places Rangers 10th in the 12-team league, marks the club's worst start in 47 years and follows a disappointing exit from Champions League qualification. During a post-match press conference, Martin faced hostile questions about his future and acknowledged the difficulty in winning over the support base. The current crisis raises serious doubts about whether he will be given the time to turn the team's performance around.</p>

          <p>An explosion, believed to be caused by a gas leak, has injured at least 25 people at a bar in the Puente de Vallecas district of Madrid, Spain.

The blast rendered the building unstable, forcing the evacuation and temporary rehousing of residents from the nine apartments above the bar.

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a decades-long ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in border camps. This policy shift is a response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which have led to food shortages and rising malnutrition in the camps. The move is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, while also potentially filling labor shortages in Thailand. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a potential "regional benchmark" for rights-based refugee solutions and a significant turning point for the displaced population.</p>
