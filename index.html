          <p>Australian airline Qantas is alerting millions of customers to a significant data breach that occurred through a third-party customer service platform. The cyberattack exposed personal information such as names, contact details, birth dates, and frequent flyer numbers for up to six million people. While financial data and passports were not compromised, the airline has apologized for the incident and notified Australian authorities. This event is part of a larger trend of cyberattacks targeting the airline industry and contributes to a record year for data breaches in Australia.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Trump concerning a "60 Minutes" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The funds will be directed to Trump's future presidential library, with no money paid directly to him, and Paramount issued no apology. The settlement is seen as a move to clear obstacles for Paramount's potential sale to Skydance Media, which requires FCC approval. First Amendment advocates have criticized the decision, viewing the lawsuit as frivolous and the settlement as a concession of journalistic principles.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle market is experiencing a fierce price war, yet startup Xpeng has maintained strong sales, delivering over 34,000 cars in June. In contrast, rivals like Nio and Li Auto showed more modest or declining figures, while market leader BYD continued its dominance with over 377,000 vehicles sold. The intense competition is also pressuring foreign brands, with Tesla facing reduced sales and new challenges from entrants like smartphone maker Xiaomi. This market dynamic reflects what Chinese officials have called disorderly competition within the rapidly growing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has become deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering after reaching verdicts on four other counts. Legal experts note that the defense's strategy of not calling any witnesses was a high-risk move. The complexity of the RICO (racketeering) charge, which is often difficult for jurors to comprehend, is considered a likely reason for the impasse. The judge has instructed the jurors to continue deliberations, but the situation introduces uncertainty and the potential for a partial verdict or a retrial on the hung count.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 30% or 35% on Japanese goods if a new trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This would mark a significant increase from the current 10% levy and the 25% tax on Japanese vehicles. The threat comes as a 90-day pause on broader global tariffs is set to expire, with Trump expressing doubt that a deal with Tokyo can be finalized in time.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling blocks a plan by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to end the program for Haitians in September, well before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge stated that the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly considering a significant strategic pivot for the company's contract manufacturing business. The potential change involves ceasing to market the 18A chipmaking process to external clients and instead focusing resources on the next-generation 14A process. This move is aimed at better competing with rival TSMC and winning major customers like Apple and Nvidia. Such a shift would represent a departure from the previous CEO's strategy and could result in a substantial financial write-off but is seen as a necessary step to revive the struggling chipmaker.</p>

The facility, surrounded by swamps, was rapidly constructed by the state of Florida to support the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown. Trump praised its secure location, noting the surrounding alligators serve as natural deterrents, and suggested similar facilities could be built in other states to increase deportations. The center, which can house up to 3,000 people, has drawn criticism from advocates who decry it as an inhumane and makeshift prison camp.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S. southern border illegally dropped to a new historic low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded apprehensions. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive enforcement policies, including swift deportations and a halt to migrant releases. These measures are part of a broader crackdown that includes deploying troops to the border and an intense messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation. While the administration touts the numbers as a success, its tactics have drawn widespread criticism and triggered outcry from local communities and politicians.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 7% amid a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump concerning the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Musk criticized the bill for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and EV tax credits, which could negatively impact Tesla's business. In response, Trump suggested he could cut the lucrative government contracts that Musk's companies, like SpaceX, rely on. The dispute adds to investor concerns as Tesla prepares to release its second-quarter delivery numbers, which are expected to show a year-over-year decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature 940-page spending bill, officially HR 1, has sparked intense political debate over its contents and fiscal impact. The legislation aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase defense and border security funding, and implement significant restrictions on social welfare programs like Medicaid. Critics, including former ally Elon Musk, have condemned the bill for potentially adding trillions to the national debt. The bill's narrow passage through Congress, requiring a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President in the Senate, highlights deep divisions even within the Republican party.</p>

The data was reportedly shared from states that offer state-funded health programs to some non-citizen residents.

          <p>The family of a 24-year-old 7-Eleven employee in Los Angeles is preparing to take her off life support after she was left brain-dead following a violent altercation. Her family alleges that her store manager attacked and suffocated her during an argument at their Melrose Avenue workplace on June 24. The victim, Jessica McLaughlin, collapsed after the incident and never regained consciousness due to severe oxygen deprivation to her brain. Police are still searching for the suspect, and the family is now planning for her funeral.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, only three of the "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech stocks managed to reach all-time highs: Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta. Microsoft's stock was boosted by stronger-than-expected growth in its Azure cloud business. Nvidia overcame a rocky start to the year, reaffirming its dominance in the AI chip sector with persistent high demand. Meta's shares rallied after its quarterly earnings far surpassed estimates, showcasing the continued strength of its advertising business, despite broader market declines earlier in the year.
