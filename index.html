          <h2>Newark Airport Faces Continued Disruptions Due to Staffing Shortages and Construction</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant flight delays and cancellations due to ongoing staffing shortages at air traffic control centers, runway construction, and adverse weather conditions. According to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, communication breakdowns between controllers and aircraft led to absences under the Federal Employees Compensation Act. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation into the issues, blaming mismanagement at the F.A.A. and previous budget cuts. United Airlines, the airport's largest carrier, has cut 35 round-trip flights per day from its Newark schedule due to equipment failures and controller staffing issues.</p>

          <p>The Greek government has launched "Kids Wallet," a state-operated mobile application designed to help parents monitor their children's screen time and verify their age on digital platforms.

The app integrates with the government services platform, allowing parents to create accounts, set time limits for app and website access, and confirm their child's age through document uploads.

          <p>OpenAI has announced it will restructure as a public benefit corporation, ensuring its nonprofit parent organization retains control of the company. This decision follows discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware and addresses concerns from civic leaders and former employees. The nonprofit will be OpenAIâ€™s largest shareholder, and the company is still negotiating the specifics of the nonprofitâ€™s stake in the new corporation and the selection process for board members. This move is seen as a victory for critics like Elon Musk, who argued the company was overly focused on profits.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures closed at their lowest level since February 2021, following OPEC+'s agreement to increase production for a second consecutive month. The decision to boost output by 411,000 barrels per day in June has led to concerns about an oversupplied market, exacerbated by fears of a recession due to rising tariffs. Goldman Sachs has cut its forecast for U.S. crude prices this year, and oilfield service firms anticipate a decline in exploration and production investment. Oil majors like Chevron and Exxon have reported lower first-quarter earnings due to the weaker price environment.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson stated that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is still on track to pass President Donald Trump's tax bill around Memorial Day. Johnson acknowledged the timetable is ambitious, but denied any setbacks despite postponed committee meetings. Republican lawmakers remain divided over proposals, including cuts for social safety net programs. Johnson said a key White House meeting with Trump ended early, preventing decisions on some aspects of the bill from being taken.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing its overpayment clawback rate from 100% to 50% after concerns that the initial policy caused financial hardship for beneficiaries. The change comes after the SSA began recovering overpayments by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to SSA's own errors. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, some advocates say it will still burden disabled workers who rely on SSDI benefits.</p>
