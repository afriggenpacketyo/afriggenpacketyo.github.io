        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship violates four Supreme Court precedents during a hearing where the Solicitor General argued against federal district court judges issuing national injunctions. Justice Kagan questioned how the Supreme Court could rule on the order's constitutionality if district court judges could not issue injunctions, with Sotomayor and Kagan pressing the Solicitor General on the legality of Trump's order. Trump defended his order on social media, stating that birthright citizenship was not intended for vacationers. This case highlights the ongoing legal battles over Trump's executive orders and their potential impact on constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changing economic conditions and policy uncertainty. Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, citing the possibility of more volatile inflation and frequent supply shocks. He cautioned that policy changes could create a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation. While he did not directly mention President Trump's tariffs, Powell has previously noted their potential to slow growth and boost inflation, adding to the challenges faced by the Fed.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after stronger-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the first three months of the year. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but analysts warned that the strong rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. The Labour government has made boosting the economy a top priority, but its decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has faced criticism from businesses.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that a recession is still a serious possibility for the United States, even after the recent rollback of tariffs on China. While Dimon acknowledged the positive impact of the tariff pauses, he noted that import taxes remain sharply higher than last year and could still cause economic damage. He defers to his bank's economists, who put recession odds at close to a toss-up, emphasizing the continued uncertainty in the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from about half before the pandemic. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of reach, particularly in cities with restrictive zoning regulations.
