          <p>India stated that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting "terrorist infrastructure" in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam. The Indian government labeled the operation "Operation Sindoor," clarifying that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an "act of war" and promised a robust response, with reports of Pakistani retaliation including shooting down Indian fighter jets. Most airlines are diverting out of Pakistani airspace and the U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope for a swift end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India conducted strikes on what it claims are terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian government stated its actions were measured and non-escalatory, targeting only known terror camps. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war and vowed to respond, leading to retaliatory actions and heightened military activity along the border. The international community, including the UN and the US, has called for restraint and de-escalation amid fears of a broader conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law that prohibits local governments from adding fluoride to the state's public water supply, citing concerns about informed consent and medical freedom. The law does not ban fluoride entirely, as residents can still purchase fluoridated water from private suppliers. Supporters of the bill argue it protects individual choice and reduces reliance on centralized health mandates, while critics argue that fluoridation has long been used to combat tooth decay. The legislation also includes support for Florida's agriculture sector and restrictions on ESG practices targeting farmers.</p>

          <p>Several newspapers report on a new Â£5bn trade deal between India and the UK, which has sparked controversy due to a 'two-tier' tax deal exempting Indian migrants from National Insurance payments. The deal, touted as the biggest since Brexit, aims to reduce tariffs on UK exports like whiskey and cars, but faces criticism from Conservative and Reform parties. Meanwhile, Labour faces turmoil as Keir Starmer refuses to reverse cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners, drawing criticism from within his own party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's claims of securing close to $9 trillion in new investments in the United States are being questioned, as evidence supporting the figure is lacking. While companies have announced significant investments, the White House has not provided data to support the total. Some investments highlighted by the administration were announced before Trump's reelection, and comparisons to the Biden administration are misleading due to differing methodologies. Experts caution that planned investment announcements do not guarantee actual implementation.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat discusses the portrayal of the rich in American television, focusing on the new Apple TV show "Your Friends & Neighbors," which challenges aspirational views of wealth. The show depicts wealthy characters in leafy Connecticut as unhappy and insecure, lacking the glamour and aesthetic distinction often associated with affluence. Douthat contrasts this with other portrayals of wealth, such as in "Mad Men," where even with personal problems, the characters inhabit a more stylish world.

          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty will not run in the Preakness Stakes, officials announced, ending the chance for a Triple Crown winner this year. Trainer Bill Mott stated that the plan is to enter Sovereignty in the Belmont Stakes instead. This decision marks the fifth time since 2018 that the Preakness will proceed without a true shot at the Triple Crown. The announcement has sparked debate about the spacing of the Triple Crown races and potential changes to the racing schedule.</p>
