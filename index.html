          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, former President Trump addressed the possibility of regime change in Iran via a post on Truth Social. He questioned why there wouldn't be a regime change if the current Iranian regime is unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." The article also highlights that Trump campaigned on the promise of "no more wars" during his presidential campaign, but global events have since shifted his views. This marks a potentially significant shift in U.S. policy toward Iran, emphasizing a more assertive stance on the nation's leadership. The events of the day have led to significant changes in Trump's views.</p>

A parishioner struck the suspect with a vehicle, and at least two staff members, including a security guard, shot and killed the attacker. The injured staff member was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, and the FBI is assisting with the investigation to determine the motive behind the shooting.</p>

          <p>China has voiced strong criticism of the United States and Israel, calling for a de-escalation of the conflict with Iran following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, stated that Washington has violated Iranian sovereignty, exacerbated tensions, and undermined the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. He urged the international community to promote peace and stability, with China and Russia defending Iran, while the U.S. and its allies defended Israel during a UN Security Council emergency meeting. Beijing's criticism was largely diplomatic, while Moscow felt less compelled to hold back.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan approaches a potential period without giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two nations, bringing economic benefits as tourist attractions, and China may announce a new loan during a potential visit by a Chinese leader to Japan. However, some experts are skeptical that a new panda loan will significantly impact Japanese diplomatic posture toward China.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a focal point in immigration debates, while he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges; however, he is not expected to be allowed to go free. Prosecutors indicated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would take Abrego Garcia into custody upon release, potentially deporting him before trial. A hearing is scheduled to discuss the conditions of his release, though the government has filed a motion to appeal the judge's order. The judge acknowledged the futility of the release order due to ICE's likely intervention.</p>

Syrian Interior Ministry spokesman Noureddine Al-Baba suggested ISIS as a likely culprit, and the country's foreign ministry condemned the attack as a destabilizing effort.

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a researcher identified five phrases that make children less likely to cooperate. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, the researcher suggests using phrases that honor a child's autonomy and foster cooperation, such as explaining the reasoning behind decisions, giving children agency over when they're ready to meet boundaries, and validating their emotions. This approach aims to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, reducing power struggles and raising emotionally resilient children.</p>

Charities note that constant online monitoring is becoming normalized from a young age, potentially fueling concerning behaviors. Cyberstalking, defined as using digital tools to harass or spread false information, can be psychologically damaging, and young people may be told they should be flattered by such behavior. The normalization of digital surveillance, including location sharing and constant messaging, sets precedents for unhealthy relationships.</p>

The U.S. alerted Israel ahead of the strikes, and Netanyahu praised the president for conducting the strikes.

          <h2>Strait of Hormuz Could Be Vulnerable to Iran Retaliation</h2>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait, a vital oil trade route, connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil daily. Iran controls the northern side of the strait, making it a critical chokepoint. Disruptions to oil flow through the strait could severely impact international energy markets and economies, potentially driving up oil and gas prices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has made it clear that while it was informed in advance of Washington's attacks on Iran, it did not participate and was not asked to. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly pressed publicly for "de-escalation", and questions have seemingly been raised privately within the government about the legality of getting involved. Saying yes to a request for help from the White House might have been difficult, but saying no would have been difficult too, after months of assiduous effort put into developing a good relationship with President Trump. Washington acting alone and choosing to send its planes direct from America meant that massive, binary decision from Starmer wasn't needed.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. China is Iran's most important oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the Islamic Republic. Iran's foreign minister warned that the country "reserves all options to defend its sovereignty" after the U.S. bombed three nuclear sites. An attempt to block the narrow waterway between Iran and Oman could have profound consequences for the global economy, as it facilitates about 20% of global consumption.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. This dominance is attributed to long-term planning, government funding, and the ability to mobilize vast sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has invested billions in developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EVs. This has also allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production, creating the world's largest public charging network.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year, offering the Category B drug as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe depression. This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution over ketamine therapy, but is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

Although the strikes may have been effective, they may have missed the uranium stocks, and Iran could reconstitute the program.
