          <p>Millions of people participated in "No Kings" protests across the United States, organized by a coalition of advocacy groups to demonstrate against perceived abuses of power by the Trump administration. The rallies focused on issues such as immigration policies, the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, and what organizers describe as a trend toward authoritarianism. Speakers like Bill Nye and Senator Adam Schiff addressed large crowds, while Republican leaders criticized the events, labeling them "Hate America" rallies. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, with organizers emphasizing their actions were rooted in a love for the country and its democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia police have discovered human remains in a shallow grave on the grounds of an abandoned school, which they believe belong to 23-year-old Kada Scott, who has been missing for two weeks. The discovery was made following a specific anonymous tip, in an area where items belonging to Scott had been found earlier in the week. While the medical examiner has yet to formally confirm the identity and cause of death, authorities have informed Scott's family of the development. A 21-year-old man, Keon King, was previously charged with kidnapping in connection with her disappearance.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor investigates the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski, a case with personal connections to her Pennsylvania hometown. The report details how Shymanski's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, reported him missing and how her subsequent boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, became the prime suspect. Holbrook was later convicted of the murder after evidence linked him to the disposal of Shymanski's dismembered body. The article explores the contentious divorce, Snyder's decision to invoke her Fifth Amendment right at trial, and the lingering questions from Shymanski's family about her potential involvement.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the Interstate 5 freeway in Southern California was closed for several hours on Saturday for a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire event at Camp Pendleton. The demonstration, marking the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps, was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The closure, which affected a route used by approximately 80,000 drivers daily, was implemented by the California Highway Patrol due to safety concerns over live munitions being fired over the highway. The Marine Corps stated it did not request the closure, creating a point of contention with state officials.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized the Trump administration for a military event at Camp Pendleton that necessitated the closure of a major section of Interstate 5. Newsom accused the president of "putting his ego over responsibility," calling the live-fire exercise an "absurd show of force" and a dangerous disregard for public safety. The dispute highlights the escalating tensions between the state and federal governments, with California officials stating the closure was a necessary safety precaution. A spokesperson for Vice President JD Vance, who attended the event, dismissed Newsom's safety concerns, asserting the event was routine training.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on Palestinian civilians within Gaza. Such an act would be a severe violation of the current ceasefire agreement brokered with Israel. Washington has informed other guarantors of the peace deal, including Egypt and Qatar, and stated that measures would be taken to protect Gaza's population if the attack proceeds. This warning comes as the first phase of the ceasefire, which includes the release of hostages and prisoners, is still in progress, and follows recent authenticated videos of public executions carried out by Hamas.</p>

While its parent company SMEE has focused on less advanced back-end processes, AMIES represents a renewed effort to break the bottleneck in front-end wafer fabrication.

          <p>Ayish Younis, an 89-year-old Palestinian man, is once again living in a tent after being displaced from his home in Rafah during the recent Israel-Hamas war. This experience brings his life full circle, as he first became a refugee at age 12 during the 1948 war when his family fled their village of Barbara. In the intervening decades, he became a teacher, raised 18 children, and built a multi-story home, only to see it destroyed. Despite the current ceasefire, Younis expresses deep pessimism about Gaza's future, believing the devastation is too great to overcome, a sentiment echoed by his children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder and chairman of betting company Betfred, has warned that a significant tax hike on the gambling industry could force the closure of all 1,287 of its UK shops. Such a move would jeopardize 7,500 jobs. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on betting firms, a proposal supported by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to fund child poverty reduction. Done stated that even a moderate increase would render the retail business unprofitable, pushing customers to untaxed offshore betting sites and further decimating the UK's high streets.

          <p>Prince Andrew will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, following intense public and palace pressure over his association with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While the move is a significant symbolic blow to his reputation, his day-to-day life may not change dramatically, as he remains a prince and continues to reside at Royal Lodge in Windsor. The decision, reportedly encouraged by King Charles and Prince William, is an attempt by Buckingham Palace to end the persistent negative headlines. However, with a posthumous memoir from victim Virginia Giuffre set for release, questions surrounding Andrew's conduct are unlikely to disappear.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that a U.S. airstrike destroyed a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean, which he described as a "drug-carrying submarine" loaded primarily with fentanyl. The operation is part of a broader U.S. military campaign targeting narcotics trafficking in the region, which has heightened tensions with Venezuela. Two survivors from the strike, from Colombia and Ecuador, were rescued and have been repatriated to their home countries for prosecution, while two other crew members were killed. The incident occurs amid a significant U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and speculation about covert operations inside Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The Indonesian island of Lombok is undergoing a government-driven transformation to become a major tourist destination, mirroring the success of its famous neighbor, Bali. This "Bali-fication" has brought glitzy resorts, a Grand Prix racetrack, and economic opportunities, with many locals opening businesses and earning more from tourism. However, the development has a dark side, including forced evictions of local families to make way for construction, with residents like surf guide Damar losing their homes. The rapid changes are creating a conflict between the promise of prosperity and the loss of land, culture, and a traditional way of life.</p>
