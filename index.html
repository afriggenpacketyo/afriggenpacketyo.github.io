          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million, accusing him of extensive narco-trafficking. This doubles the previous reward offered by the Biden administration. The indictment, originally from 2020, alleges narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. Despite international pressure and sanctions, Maduro remains in power, with his government dismissing the new reward as a desperate political propaganda move.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing the presence of federal law enforcement agencies in Washington, D.C., to address a recent surge in violent crime. This operation, part of the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," will focus on high-traffic tourist areas and known crime hotspots for an initial seven-day period. The White House stated there will be "no safe harbor for violent criminals," aiming to restore safety for residents and visitors.

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton won the biggest title of his career at the Canadian Open, defeating Russia's Karen Khachanov in a tight three-set final. After dropping the first set in a tiebreak, the 22-year-old rallied to win 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-6(3). The victory makes Shelton the youngest American to win a Masters 1000 tournament since Andy Roddick in 2004. The match was briefly interrupted by technical issues with line-calling equipment, but Shelton maintained his resilience to clinch the deciding tiebreak.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen parents. This marks the fourth court ruling to halt the policy nationwide, following a Supreme Court decision that limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified a class action for all affected children born in the U.S., stating the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed on the grounds that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The administration argues the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to parents without permanent legal status.</p>

          <p>Shares of SoftBank Group jumped 13% to a new record high following the announcement of its fiscal first-quarter profits, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The Japanese investment firm reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp turnaround from a loss in the previous year. The strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, fueled by investments in companies like Grab and Swiggy. Several of its portfolio companies are also expected to launch IPOs soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly stated that the University of California should not yield to pressure from the Trump administration in negotiations to restore over half a billion dollars in frozen federal research grants. The funding for UCLA was suspended amid allegations of antisemitism on campus. Newsom criticized recent settlements by other universities, asserting that UC must not "sell their soul" or compromise on principles like academic freedom. The grant suspensions impact critical research in fields like neuroscience and clean energy, and university leaders are currently in dialogue with the administration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service requested that military engineers raise the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River to ensure safety for Vice President JD Vance's family boating trip. A spokesperson for Vance stated that the Vice President and his staff were unaware of the request, which was made to accommodate security and emergency response watercraft. The Secret Service confirmed the decision was an operational necessity made during standard planning, after a public safety boat reportedly ran aground during a scouting mission. The action has drawn some public criticism and comparisons to a similar incident involving a former vice president.</p>

          <p>A new study in Science Advances quantifies that California's fire season is starting significantly earlier and lasting longer due to human-caused climate change. Researchers found the season begins an average of 46 days earlier in the Cascade Range and 24 days earlier in the Sierra Nevada compared to the early 1990s. The primary drivers are earlier snowmelt and increased drying of flammable vegetation, not an increase in human-ignited fires. The findings confirm anecdotal observations that wildfire has become a year-round threat in many parts of the state, with 2025 already seeing significantly more acreage burned than average.</p>

          <p>The UK government has started detaining dozens of migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new pilot deportation agreement with France. Under the "one in, one out" deal, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept an approved asylum seeker from France via a safe route. The Home Secretary confirmed that transfers to removal centers are underway and the first returns could happen within weeks. The government stated it will robustly defend against legal challenges, asserting that France is a safe country for asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Meta's launch of a new map feature on Instagram, which allows users to share their location with friends, has prompted a significant backlash over privacy concerns. Although Meta states the feature is opt-in by default, many users expressed alarm, with some claiming their location was shared without their consent. Social media users voiced fears that the tool could be exploited for stalking or other malicious purposes. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded, stating the company is investigating but believes the issue is largely due to user confusion.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss pill, orforglipron, showed significant efficacy in a late-stage clinical trial. Adults with obesity who took the pill lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks. The company says the results are on par with injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound, though some participants experienced side effects like nausea and vomiting. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, potentially making a more accessible and convenient pill-based option available by 2026.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing federal agencies to consider rule changes that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to offer investments in alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity. While not an immediate change, the move could significantly broaden the investment options for millions of Americans beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Proponents, including investment firms and the crypto industry, argue it provides greater choice, while critics have historically cited the higher risk, fees, and volatility associated with these assets for retirement savings.

Revenue increased by 12.8% to $1.51 billion, beating estimates, but earnings per share missed the mark. The company reported a solid 5.8% increase in same-store sales, driven by higher customer traffic, a trend that has continued into the third quarter. Management plans a modest menu price increase to help counter the commodity inflation, which is expected to worsen. (not investment advice)</p>
