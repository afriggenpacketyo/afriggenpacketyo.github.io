          <p>President Trump has been briefed on potential actions against Iran's Fordo nuclear site, considering the risks and benefits of military intervention to disable it due to concerns about rapid weapons production. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision is pending, contingent on Tehran abandoning its nuclear program, as diplomatic efforts are underway involving the U.K. and EU officials seeking a resolution. Trump is weighing the use of bunker-buster bombs and is aware of intelligence reports detailing Iran's potential bomb production timeline, though Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and will respond to any threats. The situation remains fluid as Trump prefers to make a decision at the last moment, considering the volatility of war.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, initially a Category 3 storm, made landfall in Oaxaca, Mexico, bringing strong winds and heavy rain that are expected to cause life-threatening flooding and mudslides. The storm, which briefly reached Category 4 status, has since been downgraded to Category 1, with forecasts predicting continued weakening and eventual dissipation. Acapulco, previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023, is among the areas facing potential impacts, as the National Hurricane Center warns of dangerous storm surge and destructive waves. Residents are urged to take precautions as the storm's impact extends beyond wind speeds, with water hazards posing the greatest risk.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is confronting a significant crisis as the Trump administration intensifies immigration raids, prompting widespread protests and fear within the city's immigrant communities. Bass, a former community organizer, has denounced the raids as chaotic and has emphasized Los Angeles' identity as a city of immigrants. Despite facing criticism over her leadership during past crises, Bass has received praise for her forceful stance against the immigration policies, which have led to economic disruptions and anxieties among residents. The city is grappling with the aftermath of the raids, including concerns about budget deficits and police overtime costs, as Bass urges support for local businesses and peaceful demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's renewed focus on workplace immigration enforcement is raising concerns about potential disruptions to essential industries such as farming, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing. Undocumented workers comprise a significant portion of the workforce in these sectors, particularly in states like Nevada, Texas, California, and New York, leading to fears of labor shortages and increased food prices. While the White House argues that these workers depress wages for American-born citizens, research suggests that deportations could lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers and a decline in U.S. GDP. Some restaurants are already experiencing staffing issues due to workers' fears, highlighting the complex economic implications of the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl was injured in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, after an encounter with an alligator while swimming with a group of children. The girl sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries, possibly from a bite or claw, prompting authorities to remove the children from the water. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) stated the incident was likely not predatory, but the alligator was euthanized per protocol. Residents reported increased alligator sightings during daylight hours, leading the NCWRC to request notifications of large alligators exhibiting unusual behavior.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance on assessing applications for oil and gas projects, requiring operators to consider emissions from burning oil and gas, not just production emissions. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that climate impacts must include downstream emissions, potentially affecting projects like Rosebank and Jackdaw. Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the guidance provides clarity for the North Sea oil and gas industry. Climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely impact the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels and are incompatible with climate commitments, with the climate watchdog pausing decisions on licenses until the government clarified its position.</p>

Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to meet with his U.S. counterpart Marco Rubio to address disagreements and seek diplomatic resolutions, with further talks planned in Geneva with EU and Iranian representatives.

          <h2>Study Finds Massive Afforestation Needed to Offset Big Oil's Reserves</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that offsetting the carbon emissions from the reserves held by the world's 200 largest oil and gas companies would require planting a forest the size of North America. The research highlights the economic and ecological challenges of relying on tree-planting to balance CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Researchers found that afforestation would displace infrastructure, agriculture, and habitats, and cost the companies trillions of dollars. The study underscores the need for reducing fossil fuel extraction and use, as offsetting alone is not a viable solution to climate change.</p>

          <p>Honda is recalling 259,033 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential defect in the brake pedal pivot pin, which may cause the pedal to move and prevent safe stopping. The recall affects Acura TLX models from 2021-2025, as well as Acura MDX and Honda Pilot models from 2023-2025. Affected vehicles will display a warning light and exhibit an abnormal pedal feeling, with owners being contacted to have the brake pedal replaced if necessary. The issue stemmed from a production transition to Mexico, where insufficient training led to improperly staked pivot pins.</p>

We need policies to incentivise and reward the right behaviours, but we also need to introduce propositions that take the cost and complexity out of going electric. Greener options need to be simple and affordable, rather than another thing for people to worry about. That’s why in most instances, EV charging at long-dwell locations, such as at home, is key to making life with an EV affordable, tapping into cheaper rates when there’s less demand on the electricity grid, for example.</p>

          <h2>National History Day: Students Impress Judges by Digging Up the Past</h2>

          <p>National History Day (NHD), the annual US-based competition invites the top middle and high school students from more than half a million competitors to present their projects: documentaries, performances, websites, papers and exhibits on any topic from history, as long it adheres to the year’s theme. When I competed, the cardinal rule was to abstain from any citing of Wikipedia, a transgression that today seems nostalgically benign. Students now learn to hunt down reputable sources in an era defined by untrustworthy generative AI and revisionist histories. It’s this flavor of research – active, firsthand, hands-dirtying – that history professors at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, who started NHD in 1974, saw as the antidote to the traditional textbooks and multiple choice repetition that often went hand in hand with learning history.</p>
