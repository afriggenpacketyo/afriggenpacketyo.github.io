          <p>U.S. Northern Command recently conducted "Falcon Peak 25.2" at Eglin Air Force Base, testing various counter-drone systems to protect national security sites from incursions. The demonstration included interceptor drones capturing hostile drones with nets and acoustic systems detecting them by sound. This initiative follows concerns over thousands of drones in U.S. airspace and hundreds of reported incursions at military installations in 2024, highlighting the Pentagon's efforts to enhance defenses against potential surveillance or explosive threats. The goal is to establish rapid response teams nationwide.</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested NATO Article 4 consultations after three Russian fighter jets allegedly violated its airspace for an unusually long 12 minutes on Friday. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas condemned the incident as a "dangerous provocation" that escalates regional tensions. Russia's Defense Ministry, however, claimed the flight adhered to international rules and did not breach Estonian airspace. This incident follows a previous event where NATO jets shot down Russian drones entering Polish airspace, underscoring ongoing concerns about Russian military activity near NATO borders.</p>

This program, which will replace existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa categories, aims to attract "highly valuable" contributors to the U.S. Additionally, the administration is considering a $5 million "Platinum Card" for temporary, tax-exempt stays. This policy also includes a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old Argentinian hiker, Matias Augusto Travizano, died after falling approximately 2,000 feet down the Wintun Glacier on Mt. Shasta. Travizano, who had successfully summited the mountain, veered off the Clear Creek Trail during his descent and lost control on an icy surface. He collided with a boulder, regained consciousness briefly, then slid further. This incident marks another fatality on the treacherous mountain, which averages about one death annually, prompting authorities to issue warnings about its hazards and the importance of navigation tools and climbing partners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, warned that parliament is vulnerable to espionage after charges against two men accused of spying for China were dropped. Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash, who denied the allegations, saw their case withdrawn by the Crown Prosecution Service due to insufficient evidence. Sir Lindsay expressed his disappointment, stating the decision "leaves the door open to foreign actors." The Home Office also criticized the outcome, while Beijing has consistently dismissed the allegations as "malicious slander."</p>

          <p>New research reveals that glaciers across the western U.S., Canada, and Switzerland have lost approximately 12-13% of their ice volume since 2020, double the rate of the previous decade. This accelerated melt is attributed to prolonged heat waves, dry conditions, and reduced winter snow. Scientists warn of significant consequences, including rising sea levels, increased coastal flooding, and disruption to marine ecosystems and food supplies. Experts emphasize the urgent need for societal preparation for a future without these glaciers, linking the phenomenon to human-induced climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, a move Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated aims to encourage companies to "train Americans" instead of hiring foreign workers. This policy could significantly impact the U.S. tech industry, which heavily relies on H-1B visa holders, particularly from India and China. Critics, including venture capitalists and immigration experts, question the executive branch's legal authority to impose such an exorbitant fee, arguing it will deter top global talent and harm innovation, potentially facing legal challenges.

          <p>President Trump's threats to revoke broadcast TV station licenses, echoed by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, highlight the government's control over a crucial part of the media industry. This article explains that networks like ABC obtain over-the-air spectrum licenses from the FCC, requiring them to serve the "public interest." While revoking a license involves a complex legal process, the threats come amid local TV station consolidation efforts, such as Nexstar's proposed merger. The situation raises concerns about political influence on media and the future of broadcast regulations.</p>

          <p>British supermodel David Gandy expresses deep concern over artificial intelligence's impact on the fashion industry, warning it poses an "existential threat" to models and creative professionals. He highlights the rise of AI-generated imagery, where models don't physically exist, and the practice of "scraping" existing images to create new ones. Gandy, who famously campaigned for male models to achieve parity with female supermodels, fears this trend could diminish human artistry and negatively affect mental health, particularly among young people. He advocates for urgent regulation to protect the industry's future.</p>

          <p>Kenyan athlete Evans Kibet, a long-distance runner, claims he was tricked into joining the Russian army and is now a prisoner-of-war in Ukraine. Kibet states he went to Russia for races, but his host later presented him with Russian papers he unknowingly signed, leading him to a military camp and forced enlistment. He insists he never fought and escaped before being captured by Ukrainian soldiers, whom he pleaded with not to shoot. His family is traumatized but relieved he is with Ukrainians, urging Kenyan authorities to facilitate his repatriation.</p>
