          <p>Several prominent tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg and Reid Hoffman, are reportedly investing in fortified, self-sufficient compounds, leading to speculation about their preparations for a potential global catastrophe. These so-called "doomsday bunkers" are often built under the guise of basements or secondary homes in remote locations like Hawaii or New Zealand. The trend has intensified discussions around the potential existential risks posed by advanced artificial intelligence, climate change, or other societal collapses, raising questions about whether these leaders possess insights unknown to the general public.</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted overwhelmingly to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her administration's failure to address the country's escalating crime rates. The impeachment, supported by 118 out of 122 lawmakers, was triggered by her "moral incapacity" to govern, following a recent shooting at a concert in Lima that heightened public anger. Congress leader Jose Jeri has been sworn in as the interim president until the scheduled elections in April 2026, marking another chapter of political instability for the nation.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian strikes targeting Ukraine's capital have resulted in significant power and water supply disruptions, particularly in Kyiv's eastern districts. Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported that nine people were injured in the attacks on energy infrastructure and residential buildings. Concurrently, a separate drone strike in the Zaporizhzhia region killed a seven-year-old child, as Moscow continues its escalated campaign against Ukrainian energy facilities, which President Zelensky has described as an attempt to create chaos.</p>

          <p>England's higher education watchdog, the Office for Students (OfS), has cautioned that universities could face significant sanctions, including fines or loss of funding, if they fail to protect Jewish students from harassment during pro-Palestinian protests. Arif Ahmed, the OfS's free speech director, emphasized that the freedom of speech does not extend to intimidation or discrimination, expressing concern about rising antisemitism on campuses. The warning follows a series of demonstrations held on the anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, which have heightened tensions within academic communities.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from S&P Global Ratings, China's real estate market is projected to experience a more severe downturn in 2025 than previously anticipated, with new home sales expected to drop by 8%. This marks the fifth consecutive year of decline for the sector, which has been hampered by fragile homebuyer sentiment and a slowdown in government policy support. The updated forecast suggests the market could shrink to half its 2021 size, delaying any hopes for a near-term recovery and signaling continued economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hargreaves Lansdowne, the largest retail investment platform in the U.K., has issued a strong warning against investing in cryptocurrencies, despite recent regulatory easing. The firm stated that assets like Bitcoin do not qualify as a traditional asset class, lack intrinsic value, and should not be relied upon to meet financial goals. This cautionary stance comes as the U.K. lifts a ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors, highlighting the deep division within the financial industry regarding the legitimacy and stability of digital assets.

          <p>Luxury automaker Ferrari experienced its worst trading day in history, with its stock price falling over 15% after the company released disappointing full-year guidance and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions.

The revised forecast, which analysts deemed overly conservative, has raised concerns about the company's growth trajectory and its ability to adapt to the evolving automotive landscape.

          <p>The U.S. freight trucking industry is facing a surge in online cargo theft, which has reportedly increased by 1,500% over the past four years. Fraudsters, many operating from Eastern Europe, are using sophisticated methods to steal identities and divert valuable shipments, costing the industry an estimated $19 million per day. Industry leaders are urging Congress to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA) to establish a federal task force and a national database to address this growing, tech-driven criminal activity that threatens supply chains and consumer prices.</p>

He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different media environment and closer relationships off the pitch, but rejected the notion that they possess a superior attitude.</p>

          <p>SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has criticized California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter for her conduct during a recent interview and her perceived hostility towards the cryptocurrency industry. Scaramucci, a crypto advocate, suggested that if Democrats continue with such approaches, Republicans could maintain political control for a generation. His comments align with other crypto industry leaders who view Porter, a protégé of Senator Elizabeth Warren, as an opponent to digital asset innovation, citing her past investigations into Bitcoin mining and votes against crypto-friendly legislation.</p>

          <p>While Chinese semiconductor stocks have significantly outperformed their global counterparts this year, driven by Beijing's push for technological self-sufficiency, some investors are becoming cautious about their soaring valuations. A key gauge of Chinese chip shares has risen 55% since late June, far outpacing gains in the U.S. and other parts of Asia. Fund managers warn that these high multiples leave little room for error and that market patience may be thin if these companies fail to deliver on their ambitious growth expectations.

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has threatened to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick during the ongoing government shutdown, during which they are required to work without pay. Duffy referred to the absent employees as "problem children" and claimed a small subset of controllers is responsible for a majority of the nation's flight delays. With the shutdown entering its second week, the rising absenteeism is causing significant disruptions at major airports, while political leaders in Washington remain at a stalemate over a funding resolution.</p>

In a related incident, Bray's family was initially blocked from boarding their flight at Newark airport when their reservation was mysteriously canceled at the last minute, though they have since departed.</p>

This development, along with positive demand signals from Nvidia, has boosted investor confidence in the semiconductor sector's central role in the expanding artificial intelligence industry, leading to strong market performance.
