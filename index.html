        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New Orleans Police Department's use of facial recognition technology in the search for escaped inmates is under fire from civil rights groups and some politicians, despite aiding in the recapture of one fugitive. Project N.O.L.A., a private organization operating approximately 200 facial recognition cameras throughout the city, identified two escapees in the French Quarter, leading to one arrest. Critics, including the ACLU, raise constitutional and privacy concerns, arguing citizens are unknowingly being surveilled. The police department maintains the technology falls within legal exceptions, while others worry about accountability and the potential for racial bias in the AI system.</p>

          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon for approximately 20 seconds, resulting in two commercial jets aborting landings at Reagan National Airport. The incident occurred due to a temporary antenna's placement, which affected communication as the helicopter approached the Pentagon. An Army official said there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic. The FAA declined to comment on the incident, citing an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>

He argues that as the United States becomes more focused on its own interests, AI could become a bargaining chip, making it crucial for Japan to develop its own defense-related AI solutions. Japan's Defense Ministry has already outlined basic policies for AI use in defense, but concerns remain about credibility and misuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarket operators are boosting sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestic rice, following similar moves by Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. The decision reflects consumer interest in cheaper alternatives due to rising prices and supply concerns, with the hope that increased choice will boost overall rice consumption. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan hailed the sale of U.S.-grown rice as "historic" for American farmers and timely for Japanese consumers facing food price concerns.</p>

          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes on June 1st, many vapers are stockpiling the devices, fearing the alternatives won't satisfy their needs. Concerns range from the inconvenience of rechargeable vapes to changes in taste due to different E-liquid formulations. While the ban aims to reduce environmental impact and discourage youth vaping, some worry it will drive ex-smokers back to cigarettes. Retailers are seeing a surge in sales as consumers stock up, and debates continue over whether the ban prioritizes environmental concerns over public health.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States increasingly recognizes Japan's economic importance after holding trade talks with U.S. officials. Akazawa emphasized the significance of economic security issues, like supply chains, in the discussions and urged the removal of additional tariffs imposed on Japan. The talks coincided with the approval of Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, signaling a potential shift in U.S. attitudes towards Japanese investment. While Japan seeks the elimination of all additional tariffs, compromises may be necessary to secure an early agreement.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented strict new rules limiting press access inside the Pentagon, citing concerns about leaks of classified and unclassified information. The restrictions confine reporters to a specific area and require escorts for movement within the building, drawing criticism from the Pentagon Press Association, who claim it is an attack on the freedom of the press. The move follows an investigation into multiple leaks and the firing of several top aides. The new rules are comparable to restrictions at the White House, but more stringent than those at other major executive branch agencies.</p>

          <p>The European Union is calling for a trade deal with the United States based on "respect" rather than "threats" after President Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic affirmed the EU's commitment to securing a mutually beneficial agreement while standing ready to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, emphasizing the need for negotiations. The EU remains firm in its strategy of de-escalation while preparing to respond if necessary.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. The move aims to address rising rice prices that have impacted households amid broader inflation. The government intends to begin procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons from its reserves. It is uncertain whether this measure will lead to an overall drop in rice prices, given the limited amount of reserves.</p>

          <p>Cuts to weather balloon sites by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are causing data gaps that concern meteorologists.

Experts say that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture, which cannot be adequately substituted by satellites or radar. Meteorologists warn that these cuts could compromise public safety and increase the risk of needless loss of life.</p>
