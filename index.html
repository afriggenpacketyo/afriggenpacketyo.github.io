          <p>A newly discovered dinosaur species, named Enigmacursor, will be displayed at the Natural History Museum in London, marking the first new dinosaur exhibit since 2014. The labrador-sized dinosaur lived approximately 150 million years ago and was initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus. Scientists identified unique features in its leg bones, leading to its reclassification as a distinct species. This discovery helps scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic period and the evolution of larger dinosaur species, filling gaps in the current understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossilized remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 11 Iranian nationals across eight states as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. One of those arrested is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with alleged connections to Hezbollah. Officials stated that five of the arrested individuals had prior criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions. The arrests are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to increase immigration arrests, amidst heightened security concerns following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Officials maintain that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland.</p>

          <p>Lab-grown meat, also known as cultivated meat, is gaining attention as a potential solution to the environmental problems associated with traditional meat production, but its benefits are debated. Companies like Ivy Farm Technologies are developing lab-grown meat products, such as burgers and sausages, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and land use. While advocates claim it can meet the growing demand for meat more sustainably, critics argue that its environmental benefits are not yet proven and that reducing meat consumption is a better approach. The science involves growing animal cells in vats, but the process requires energy and resources, making its climate impact uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Park, a suspect charged in connection with the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, died in federal custody. The 32-year-old was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, and his cause of death is currently unclear. Park was accused of shipping ammonium nitrate to Guy Bartkus, who died in the blast outside the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic. Prosecutors alleged that Park and Bartkus shared nihilist beliefs and that the attack was motivated by anti-natalist ideology. Despite the damage to the clinic, none of the stored embryos were lost, and the practice has reopened in a temporary location.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the diminishing impact of scandals on voters' decisions, highlighting examples such as Andrew Cuomo's mayoral campaign despite past sexual harassment allegations. The article suggests that voters now weigh scandals as one factor among many, rather than automatic disqualifiers. Factors contributing to this shift include a change in public perception of sex scandals, the cognitive overload of multiple accusations, and increasing political polarization. The piece argues that while scandals still matter, voters are more willing to overlook them if they believe a candidate is more electable or shares their political views, with Donald Trump serving as another prime example of this trend.</p>

The club intends to appeal the decision, asserting their ability to provide necessary financial resources to guarantee their place in Ligue 1.

The club's owner, John Textor, maintains that the club's finances are in good standing, citing investments and improved cash flow.

Trapped inside, he struggled to break the windows and escape, eventually being rescued by passersby. Arenas spent six days in the hospital recovering from the accident and expressed gratitude to those who saved him. He is now focused on joining USC's basketball practices and helping others, viewing his survival as a second chance.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower complaint alleges that a top Justice Department official, Emil Bove, suggested the Trump administration should defy court orders related to immigration enforcement. The complaint, filed by Erez Reuveni, claims Bove and other officials discussed misleading courts and potentially ignoring judges' rulings. Reuveni alleges Bove said the department should consider saying "f--- you" to the courts and "ignore any such court order." The allegations come as Bove is nominated to serve on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Senate Democrats are expected to highlight these claims during Bove's confirmation hearing.</p>

          <p>President Trump is taking a victory lap following a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran, sharing praise from NATO officials for the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While the administration touts the "obliteration" of Iran's nuclear research facilities, intelligence officials suggest the program was only set back by months. Questions remain regarding Iran's enriched uranium supply and undisclosed research facilities. Despite the ceasefire, tensions persist, and the wars in Gaza and Ukraine continue. The White House is emphasizing the success of the strikes, with Vice President JD Vance outlining Trump's foreign policy doctrine.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that while Republicans largely support the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, overall disapproval prevails among the general public. The poll indicates bipartisan concern about a potential wider war with Iran. Confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation is divided along partisan lines. A significant majority, including a third of Republicans, believe President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action against Iran. Most Americans believe Iran will attempt to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests, as opposed to negotiating. The poll also shows continued negative perceptions of the U.S. economy.</p>

The Peace & Justice Law Center argued that the injunctions were racially biased, targeting alleged Latino criminal organizations while ignoring white supremacist gangs. Gang injunctions, which restrict suspected gang members' activities, have faced increasing legal challenges and criticism for being overly broad and discriminatory. Spitzer indicated that his office could seek new injunctions under the revised definition if necessary.</p>

The cease-fire lacks a diplomatic agreement with Iran on its nuclear program, and the assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear facilities is still underway. Without international monitoring, Iran could withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and covertly build a bomb. A more robust diplomatic deal with verifiable limits on uranium enrichment would have been preferable to the military strike, which offered only a temporary reprieve.</p>

          <p>The winning design for a memorial honoring Queen Elizabeth II in London will include a bridge with a translucent balustrade reminiscent of her wedding tiara. Designed by Foster + Partners, the memorial will also feature statues of the Queen and Prince Philip. The design includes two gates, two gardens dedicated to the Commonwealth and UK communities, and a unifying path. The project, publicly funded at an estimated $62 million, is set to be formally announced in April 2026, coinciding with what would have been Queen Elizabeth's 100th birthday month.</p>
