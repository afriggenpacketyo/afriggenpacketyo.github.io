          <p>The fashion accessory chain Claire's is on the brink of collapse in the UK and Ireland, appointing administrators and putting 2,150 jobs at risk. The company's 306 stores in the region will continue trading while options, including a potential sale, are explored to secure the brand's future. This move follows the company's US bankruptcy filing, driven by a shift to online shopping, fierce competition from fast-fashion giants, and significant debt. The retailer, once a mall staple for teens, has struggled to maintain its popularity in the modern market.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the state will proceed with drawing new congressional maps with the stated goal of helping Democrats regain control of the U.S. House. This action is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas, which could add several GOP seats. Newsom's proposal aims to retaliate by potentially eliminating up to five Republican-held seats in California, escalating a partisan battle over electoral maps. The move highlights the national implications of state-level redistricting, with control of Congress hanging in the balance ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>As a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin approaches, many Ukrainians are wary of being excluded from negotiations concerning their country's fate. A recent poll indicates that while Ukrainians are open to diplomacy, a vast majority reject making territorial concessions to Russia. Analysts believe that without significant military and political pressure on Moscow, Russia is unlikely to alter its demands, viewing the talks as a potential attempt to force Ukraine into capitulation. Ukrainian officials have emphasized that any agreements made without their participation will be considered illegitimate and counterproductive to achieving a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Hashem Abedi, the man convicted for his role in planning the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, has been charged with the attempted murder of three prison officers. The incident allegedly occurred at HMP Frankland, a high-security prison, where Abedi is also accused of assaulting a fourth guard and possessing a knife. Abedi is currently serving a minimum 55-year sentence for assisting his brother in the suicide attack that killed 22 people.

          <p>The State Department's annual human rights report has been significantly altered under the Trump administration, drawing sharp criticism for its political motivations and departure from long-standing standards. The revised reports allegedly remove entire categories, such as discrimination against LGBTQ+ people and violence against women, while softening criticism of authoritarian regimes favored by the administration. Critics, including former officials, argue the changes undermine the report's credibility and abandon decades of bipartisan support for objective human rights monitoring. The analysis suggests the new definitions align more with domestic political agendas than with international norms.</p>

This move allows shoppers to order perishable groceries alongside other Amazon products like electronics and household goods in a single cart for rapid delivery. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, positioning Amazon to compete more aggressively with rivals like Instacart and Walmart+.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell 17% after the company reported a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analyst expectations. The disappointing earnings report arrived just before the expiration of the post-IPO lockup period, which could introduce more stock volatility. While the company raised its full-year revenue guidance and reported that revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, some analysts were concerned by light capital expenditure guidance. The results have created near-term uncertainty for the stock despite strong long-term demand for its AI data center services. (not investment advice)</p>

The case went cold for over two decades until investigators utilized genetic genealogy in 2014, which pointed them toward the Miller surname. After identifying Bryan Miller as a person of interest due to a prior assault charge, police conducted surveillance and obtained his DNA through an undercover sting at a restaurant.

While the growths can look alarming, they are generally not harmful to the rabbit unless they obstruct its vision or mouth, and the virus cannot spread to humans or other animals.

          <p>Chris Philp, the UK's Conservative shadow home secretary, has reported being attacked while visiting a migrant camp in northern France. In a social media video, Philp stated that he was pelted with bottles and that a man pulled out a knife or machete, forcing him to leave quickly. Philp was in the region to investigate the ongoing migrant crisis and the effectiveness of the current Labour government's policies. The incident highlights the tense situation at the French coast as the number of people attempting to cross the English Channel continues to be a major political issue.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariffs are driving up the prices of imported goods like coffee and specialty teas, causing concern for small businesses and consumers. Coffee prices saw a 14.5% year-over-year increase in July, with retailers reporting they have no choice but to pass the costs on to customers. Importers of products like tea from India and spices from Asia, which cannot be sourced domestically, are particularly affected by the trade policies. Business owners fear that the tariffs will squeeze their already thin margins and could force smaller, quality-focused brands out of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

Bodhana, who first took up the game during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, has rapidly ascended the ranks of the chess world.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a recent nationwide blackout in Iraq, citizens once again turned to a network of millions of private diesel generators for electricity, highlighting the country's failing power infrastructure. These generators, while essential for daily life and business, are a major source of air and noise pollution, contributing to public health risks and environmental degradation. Even on normal days, the national grid provides only a fraction of the needed power, forcing most Iraqis to pay for expensive, unregulated generator subscriptions. This reliance creates a vicious cycle where the solution to power outages exacerbates the climate issues that strain the grid.</p>

A government spokesperson stated, "There is no censorship in Germany," emphasizing the country's high level of free expression. The U.S. report, which has been widely criticized by human rights groups for political bias, cited German laws against hate speech as evidence of restrictions.

          <p>Alcohol consumption among U.S. adults has fallen to its lowest level on record, according to a new Gallup survey. The poll found that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, and for the first time, a majority (53%) view even moderate drinking as harmful to one's health. This marks a significant shift in public perception, up from 45% last year. The decline in drinking does not appear to be offset by a rise in cannabis use, suggesting a broader trend toward abstention possibly driven by growing health warnings and economic pressures.</p>

A provision in a recent tax and spending package passed by the Trump administration bans Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements, a move currently blocked by a court. Experts warn that if the ban proceeds, it could severely damage the U.S. healthcare safety net, as other providers lack the capacity to absorb Planned Parenthood's patients, particularly for contraception and STI screenings.</p>

This policy aims to let Syrians assess the situation on the ground for themselves.

State lawyers contend the deployment created "anxiety and fear" and was an illegal use of a "standing army" for law enforcement support during protests. In contrast, the federal government asserts the president had the authority under Title 10 to protect federal property and personnel from what was described as a "rebellion." The trial's outcome could have significant implications for presidential power and military deployment in U.S. cities.</p>
