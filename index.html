          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and auctioning his extensive collection. This decision follows the 76-year-old's recent diagnosis with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his balance, vision, and hearing. Due to the condition, which is exacerbated by performing, Joel has also canceled all tour dates through July 2026 to focus on physical therapy and recovery. The shop was a passion project for Joel, intended to showcase vintage motorcycle aesthetics and support the local Oyster Bay community.</p>

          <p>The governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. This move supports the Trump administration's federal intervention aimed at addressing crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. The deployment significantly escalates the federal presence, adding to the already activated D.C. National Guard and other law enforcement agencies. The action has sparked protests from residents and city officials who argue the intervention is an overreach, especially as local data indicates violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>Despite a new "one in, one out" agreement between the UK and France, over 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats within the first 11 days of the deal. The pilot scheme allows the UK to return a migrant to France for each asylum seeker with a strong case that it accepts. However, removals have not yet begun, and crossings continue to rise during the summer months, with over 50,000 arrivals since the current government took power. Concerns are also growing about the use of larger, more dangerous "mega dinghies" by people smugglers.</p>

          <h2>A Personal Reflection on How Life Experience Unlocks the Power of Renaissance Art</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 03:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author recounts a personal journey from dismissing Renaissance art in her youth to deeply connecting with it after significant life events. Initially finding the religious art unrelatable, experiences like trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood revealed the profound emotional complexity in works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo. The article contrasts this newfound appreciation with the contemporary works of Jenny Saville, which are heavily influenced by Renaissance masters. It concludes that engaging with such art requires a willingness to be moved by the human condition, linking artistic empathy to real-world compassion.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents are fleeing Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood due to intense and sustained Israeli bombardment, which the local municipality describes as "catastrophic." The Israeli military plans to forcibly displace one million people to southern camps and has announced it will resume allowing tents into the territory. This escalation follows the Israeli war cabinet's decision to occupy Gaza City, a move that has prompted a general strike in Israel by families of hostages and others who fear it endangers the captives. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with widespread displacement and rising deaths from malnutrition reported by UN-backed experts.</p>

          <p>British fighter Lerone Murphy has positioned himself as a top contender for the featherweight title after a spectacular first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319. Taking the fight on just three weeks' notice, Murphy used a spinning back elbow to end the bout, extending his undefeated career record to 17 wins. The victory earned him a performance-of-the-night bonus and praise from commentators, with many suggesting he is next in line for a title shot against champion Alexander Volkanovski. The event also saw Khamzat Chimaev win the middleweight title in a historically dominant performance.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has legislated an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, forcing both parties into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike, which affected approximately 130,000 travelers daily during the peak summer season, was halted by the federal jobs minister, who cited economic risks. The union, representing 10,000 flight attendants, criticized the move as a violation of their right to strike and accused the government of siding with the airline. While the intervention aims to restore service, full operational capacity may take several days to resume.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its ban on certain AI chip exports to China, proposing a novel revenue-sharing agreement with companies like Nvidia and AMD. Under the deal, the firms would be allowed to sell specific, less powerful AI chips to Chinese companies in exchange for giving 15% of the revenue to the U.S. government. This move has sparked alarm among trade experts, who warn it sets a dangerous precedent that national security-based export controls could be for sale. The legality of the arrangement, which critics liken to an export tax, is still being examined by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-standing principle known as the "85th percentile rule," which often dictates that speed limits should match the speed of the fastest 15% of drivers, is being reconsidered across the United States.

In response to rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like road use and crash frequency should be considered.

The technique works by preparing the tissue into an "ionic glassy" state, which renders it highly transparent while preserving its original structure and morphology. This process enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules, resulting in more accurate visualizations. The method also allows for the long-term storage of the prepared tissues at low temperatures without structural degradation.</p>

The design involves a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds like Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into a "waverider" for high efficiency.
