          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the trend of Chinese academics and researchers returning to their home country as a "great loss" for the United States. Speaking in Beijing, Huang, an immigrant from Taiwan himself, reflected on the "American dream" and how the departure of bright minds, who often come to the U.S. for education, impacts American innovation. He expressed hope that the U.S. remains a place where people can pursue such dreams, even as he acknowledged his happiness for those returning to their origins amid strained U.S.-China relations.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested a 22-year-old suspect in connection with the shooting deaths of former "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye, 70, and her husband, Thomas Deluca, 70, in their Encino home. The victims were discovered during a wellness check, and investigators believe the suspect had entered their home through an unlocked door. A confrontation occurred when the couple returned, leading to the fatal shooting. The show issued a statement mourning the loss of Kaye, who they described as a "cornerstone of the Idol family."</p>

          <p>In response to the ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration, some migrant workers are using mobile apps like Coqui to monitor and report the real-time locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The apps, which rely on user-submitted sightings, help workers avoid potential arrests and detention, even for those with legal status who fear being wrongfully detained. An ICE official expressed concern that such apps are dangerous and could be used to ambush agents, while the app's creator stated it was made to help people get to work without fear.</p>

          <p>Brazil's prosecutor-general has formally urged the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to "violently overthrow the democratic order," culminating in the January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings by his supporters. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison for the charges, which he has dismissed as a "witch hunt."</p>

This strategy allows them to acquire the precious metal at a discount, use local currency, and support their domestic mining industries without depleting foreign exchange reserves. This trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire among nations to strengthen their financial buffers against geopolitical and economic risks. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer noted that while he believes the latter two companies will eventually recover, the immediate, unforgiving nature of investor response during earnings season makes it a difficult period to navigate.

A key goal of the renovation is to make the Victorian-era glasshouse net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.</p>
