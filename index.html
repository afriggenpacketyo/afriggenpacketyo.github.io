          <p>An opinion article challenges the long-held belief that the "China shock" negatively impacted the American economy by stealing jobs and collapsing the manufacturing labor market. The author contends that the availability of cheap Chinese goods has made life more affordable for average Americans, despite concerns about job losses. The piece questions the validity of research claiming significant job losses due to Chinese competition, suggesting that the benefits of affordable goods may outweigh the drawbacks. The article presents an alternative perspective on the economic relationship between the United States and China. Optimism is moderate, with a balanced assessment of economic impacts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economic growth remained flat at 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter, falling short of economists' expectations. This stagnation occurs amidst ongoing global trade tensions and follows the Reserve Bank of Australia's recent interest rate cut to a two-year low. The RBA anticipates a gradual increase in domestic GDP growth throughout 2025, driven by increased consumption and strong public demand. However, this recovery is projected to be slower than previously expected due to weaker global demand and domestic uncertainty. This is a neutral assessment of economic performance.</p>

          <p>Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant initially accused of writing letters threatening to assassinate President Trump, was framed, according to investigators. Prosecutors now claim that Demetric Deshawn Scott, who is set to face trial for allegedly assaulting and robbing Mr. Morales-Reyes, wrote the letters. Scott admitted to writing the letters to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying in the robbery case.

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to provide abortions as emergency care, even in states where the procedure is illegal. The rescinded guidance was issued after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade and cited the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The administration stated that the guidance did not reflect its policies, while abortion rights groups criticized the decision, accusing President Trump of reversing his stance on abortion access. The move follows legal challenges to the Biden administration's guidance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which has passed the House, aims to reduce Medicaid coverage and make changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Critics argue it's an attempt to repeal parts of Obamacare without explicitly labeling it as such, potentially leaving millions without health insurance. The bill includes provisions that would reduce federal spending on Medicaid and impose new work requirements. Democrats frame the bill as an assault on Americans' healthcare, while Republicans claim it targets waste and abuse in government health programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from the right-wing MAGA movement, despite her conservative stance on the bench. The criticism stems from several votes where she sided with liberal justices, including rejecting President Trump's effort to rescind foreign aid and denying a request to delay sentencing in his New York case. While Trump has publicly defended Barrett, sources indicate he has expressed frustration with his Supreme Court picks. Legal scholars note that it is not a fair comparison to liken Barrett to Justice David Souter, as Barrett has delivered votes overturning Roe v Wade; expanding gun rights; and rolling back the power of federal agencies.</p>
