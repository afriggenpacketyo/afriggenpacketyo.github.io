          <p>England is preparing for local elections that will serve as a crucial test of the current political climate, particularly after Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's landslide victory last year. The Conservative Party, led by Kemi Badenoch, is struggling to regain ground, creating opportunities for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Reform U.K., led by Nigel Farage, is expected to capitalize on voter frustration, and these elections will reveal how effectively they can convert their poll surge into actual votes. Voters will elect council members and regional mayors, with results expected throughout Friday, and the outcomes will significantly impact the political strategies of all major parties.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order directing the Education Department to root out school discipline frameworks based on "discriminatory equity ideology" has sparked confusion and debate in California. The order challenges state laws that limit suspensions for "willful defiance" conduct, which were designed to address disproportionate disciplining of Black and Latino students. While some fear the order will lead to more students of color being pushed out of learning, others criticize California's ban on willful defiance suspensions as a top-down policy that sidelines parents and teachers.</p>

          <p>A columnist in the Los Angeles Times argues that President Trump has damaged the "USA" brand in his first 100 days in office, undermining the country's reputation for financial stability, military strength, and cultural prestige. The article contrasts Trump's actions with those of President Franklin Roosevelt, who took decisive action to rescue the economy during his first 100 days. The piece cites negative reviews of Trump's performance in polls and suggests that worse is yet to come, pointing to a plunge in consumer confidence and a contraction in the economy.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's potential failure to qualify for the Champions League could have significant financial repercussions for the club. Missing out on Europe's elite competition would impact their transfer strategy and reduce the attractiveness of joining the club for potential signings. The club's debt is hovering around £1bn and they have made 250 staff redundant, so missing out on Champions League qualification would be a further blow to the club's finances.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have finalized a deal granting Washington access to Ukraine's natural resources, including oil, gas and minerals, setting up a reconstruction investment fund. While Trump previously sought payback for US aid, the agreement doesn't dictate repayment, and resources remain under Ukrainian ownership. The deal signals a tougher US stance against Putin and aligns with Ukraine's EU ambitions, reinvesting profits in Ukraine for a decade. The agreement is also framed as a necessity for continued US military assistance.</p>
