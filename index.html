          <p>President Trump announced a new 50% tariff rate for steel imports, set to take effect on Wednesday, during a rally in Pennsylvania. Surrounded by steelworkers, Trump declared that the tariff hike would further secure the steel industry in the United States. He also celebrated a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, claiming the investment would make the American steelmaker synonymous with greatness, while ensuring that steelworkers keep their jobs and US facilities remain open. Trump framed the move as a matter of national security, blaming past administrations for the decline of the American steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 130 retired judges have filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing that her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to that given to members of the legislative and executive branches. They call the prosecution an "egregious overreach by the executive branch" that threatens public trust in the judicial system, arguing it could create a chilling effect on judges and undermine judicial independence.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a special government employee concludes. Trump lauded Musk as one of the greatest business leaders and innovators, crediting him with overhauling the federal government through DOGE's cost-cutting efforts. While DOGE's savings fell short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise, the White House claims it saved roughly $170 billion, though some analyses suggest the initiative could cost the government $135 billion. Musk indicated he would remain involved with the administration as a friend and adviser, while Trump pledged to make DOGE's cuts permanent.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's departure from his role in the Trump administration was marked by a mix of praise and controversy, with Trump lauding Musk's contributions despite his falling short of cost-cutting goals. Musk's criticism of Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" highlighted a sense of disillusionment, while a New York Times report alleging widespread drug use added to the complexity of his exit. Musk deflected questions about the report, instead attacking the Times' credibility. The Oval Office event also featured Musk explaining a black eye he sustained during horseplay with his son, and offering his take on the "fundamental moral flaw" of the left.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer, marking the first major treatment advancement for this type of cancer in 20 years. The drug, pembrolizumab, was administered to patients before and after surgery, helping the body's immune system to recognize and attack the cancer if it returns. The trial demonstrated that patients receiving pembrolizumab experienced a doubling in the time they remained cancer-free, increasing from an average of 2.5 years to five years. This approach offers hope for improved outcomes in treating these notoriously difficult cancers.</p>

Commanders are expected to review medical records and revise official records to reflect service members' sex at birth.

          <p>President Trump has fired Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for diversity initiatives and accusing her of being highly partisan. The gallery contained a caption referencing the attack on the US Capitol carried out by Trump's supporters in early 2021. Trump issued an executive order directing the removal of "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" from the institution's museums. Sajet had emphasized the gallery's efforts to be even-handed when discussing American presidents, despite varying opinions on them.</p>

          <p>A wildfire ignited in the Covington Flats area of Joshua Tree National Park, burning 165 acres in a region considered critical for the species' future. The area is known as a "climate refugia," offering cooler temperatures and more rainfall that could allow Joshua trees to survive in a warming climate. The trees are not adapted to wildfire, making any fire damage devastating to the population. Fire crews are working to contain the blaze, but the potential loss of Joshua trees in this vital area is a major concern.</p>

          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores a potential link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that the redefinition of harm, abuse, and trauma has led to unreachable standards for parenting, making the decision to have children more fraught. The expectation that parents must not only provide basic needs but also ensure their children's mental health and career success contributes to this dread. The piece suggests that holding one's own parents to such high standards may make the prospect of parenthood daunting.</p>
