          <p>The Justice Department has charged a father-son duo and other leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel with trafficking fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin into the United States. Pedro Inzunza Noriega and his son, Pedro Inzunza Coronel, allegedly ran one of the largest fentanyl production networks, seizing over 1.65 tons of fentanyl from their holdings. Attorney General Pam Bondi designated Latin American drug trafficking organizations as terrorist organizations. The Department of Justice has charged several alleged cartel leaders and arrested sixteen people earlier this month and seized 3 million pills laced with fentanyl, which federal prosecutors said was the "largest fentanyl bust in DEA history."</p>

The contest raised concerns about access to the president being linked to purchases of a Trump-branded asset, as the $TRUMP coin is partly owned by an affiliate of the Trump Organization. Critics argue that the president and his family stand to benefit financially from purchases of the meme coin, and the dinner will take place at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. on May 22.</p>

          <p>Airbnb has launched a redesigned app to showcase its expansion into services like catering and personal training for home rentals. The company plans to invest $200 million to $250 million in this new business, aiming to drive future revenue growth. This marks Airbnb's renewed effort to move beyond home stays, after scaling back previous attempts in 2020 due to the pandemic. CEO Brian Chesky noted the rebuilt app allows for faster innovation and offering more than just homes, and the company's business chief, Dave Stephenson, said that they now feel they have such a strong foundation that they are capable of building and expanding.</p>

The group reportedly has its own currency, flag, and identification cards and wants to set up separate banking and health systems.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily reduce prescription drug costs within 30 days or face new restrictions on government payments. The order directs the Department of Health to negotiate new drug prices, potentially linking U.S. prices to those in other countries. The pharmaceutical industry opposed the order, arguing it could harm research and development. Trump threatened federal investigations and opening the U.S. market to more imported drugs. Experts noted that the order's impact on consumers may be slow, and the department of health has limited power to manipulate the prices paid by millions of Americans covered by private insurance.</p>

Doubts exist about the severity of the security situation prompting the Afrikaner resettlement, as the South African government denies any persecution, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that a refugee is someone who has to leave their country out of fear of political persecution, religious persecution or economic persecution, and they don't fit that bill.</p>

          <p>C√©line Dion made a rare appearance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest with a brief, pre-recorded message, as Switzerland will forever hold a special place in her heart. The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite. Fifteen acts performed at Tuesday's semi-final in Basel's St Jakobshalle, and Dion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.</p>

          <p>Despite economic challenges like tariffs and political uncertainty, Silicon Valley remains focused on the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Many in the tech industry believe AI will revolutionize the economy and society, overshadowing concerns about traditional economic markers. Start-ups with AI products are raising significant capital, and the industry is rapidly evolving. However, some worry about the potential for job losses due to automation and the impact of restrictive immigration policies on the talent pool.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of a basic standard of living is growing, with the bottom 60% of U.S. households unable to afford a "minimal quality of life." The analysis considers costs beyond basic necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare. The lowest-earning Americans, averaging $38,000 per year, would need $67,000 to afford the items tracked by the group's index. The cost of affording a basic level of economic security doubled from 2021 to 2023, while median earnings for the bottom 60% of income earners fell 4%.</p>

They requested a comprehensive audit and investigation into any "fraud, waste, and abuse" related to the possible transfer, including the cost of retrofitting the plane to meet Air Force One standards.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the administration "bungled" the relocation and didn't address technical problems that arose in the fall, and the agency also emphasized that the U.S. is facing a national shortage of air traffic controllers and said staffing goals for Newark's airspace have not been met for years.</p>
