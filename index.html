        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final practice session of the Japanese Grand Prix was twice halted due to grass fires beside the Suzuka track, raising concerns about race safety. Lando Norris led Oscar Piastri in a McLaren one-two before the interruptions. The fires, believed to be caused by sparks from the cars igniting dry grass, occurred despite mitigation measures implemented after similar incidents during Friday's practice. The FIA had attempted to dampen the grass and station response teams around the track. Qualifying is scheduled for Saturday, with rain predicted for Sunday's race.</p>

Many believe the tariffs will level the playing field for American businesses and bring jobs back to the US. While some industries, like automotive, face potential disruptions due to complex global supply chains, steel businesses in Delta see an opportunity in the protectionist measures. Locals express a willingness to endure potential price increases if it means supporting American workers and revitalizing the local economy.</p>

          <p>Trump's tariffs are set to disrupt global trade, potentially impacting the price of Nike's iconic Air Jordan 1 sneakers, which are primarily manufactured in Asia. Nike's shares fell after the tariff announcement, reflecting concerns about the company's supply chain. Analysts predict price increases are likely, but significant hikes could reduce demand in the competitive footwear industry. Nike may also explore alternative cost-saving measures, such as downgrading technology or extending design cycles. Ultimately, the extent of the impact depends on how much of the cost increase Nike passes on to consumers and the duration of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are seeking a prison term of more than seven years for former congressman George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges. The US attorney's office argued that a significant sentence is warranted because Santos's crimes made a mockery of the election system. Prosecutors noted that Santos has been unrepentant and defiant, dismissing the prosecution as a "witch-hunt." Santos admitted to duping voters, deceiving donors, and stealing identities to make donations to his campaign.</p>
