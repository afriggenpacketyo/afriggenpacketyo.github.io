          <p>Authorities in Michigan are seeking terrorism and assault charges against a man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect was confronted by armed citizens in the parking lot before being taken into custody by a responding deputy. All victims are expected to survive, with their conditions improving, according to officials at Munson Medical Center. The FBI is assisting local law enforcement in investigating the motive behind the violent, unprovoked attack.</p>

          <p>Protesters outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Oregon, were left confused by an individual in a full-size Elmo costume. Video shows the costumed person trolling the demonstrators by dancing and crawling on the ground, leading to a frustrating confrontation. The incident occurred amid ongoing tensions at the facility, where the city council is exploring ways to expel ICE. The location has been a site of frequent and sometimes violent clashes between activists and federal agents.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club announced it is increasing its holdings in both Cisco Systems and Honeywell, citing underlying strengths despite recent market pressures. The club is purchasing Cisco shares following a valuation-based downgrade, arguing the market undervalues its AI potential and shift to subscription revenue. It is also acquiring more Honeywell stock after a price drop, viewing the company's temporary business challenges as a strategic buying opportunity during its transformation.

          <p>When asked about Israeli claims that there is no starvation crisis in Gaza, U.S. President Donald Trump responded, "I don't know," while noting that images on television show very hungry children. Speaking alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called the situation an "absolute catastrophe," Trump mentioned that the U.S. and other nations are providing significant aid. The comments came as the Hamas-run Health Ministry reported additional deaths from malnutrition and Israeli airstrikes continue in the region.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. trade deals with Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which lower American tariffs in exchange for near-zero tariffs on U.S. goods, may impact European exporters. While some EU exports could be displaced by American products, analysts suggest the deals could also pressure these Southeast Asian nations to offer similar low-tariff terms to Europe. The agreements were finalized ahead of a U.S. deadline and a separate deal between the U.S. and the EU. This new trade landscape could intensify competition but also strengthen the EU's negotiating position in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

The Commission alleges that Temu is not doing enough to prevent the sale of illegal products that fail to meet EU safety standards. Further accusations include the use of fake discounts, insufficient vendor information, and an addictive app design. As a designated "very large online platform," Temu faces a potential fine of up to 6% of its global turnover if the violations are confirmed.</p>

          <p>Two hacker groups with links to Ukraine, Silent Crow and Cyber Partisans, have claimed responsibility for a major cyberattack that has crippled Russia's flagship airline, Aeroflot. The attack has caused widespread travel disruption, with dozens of flights delayed or canceled. The hackers assert they destroyed thousands of servers and stole 12 terabytes of data after lurking in the airline's systems for a year. The Kremlin has acknowledged the reports as "worrying," while Aeroflot works to restore its electronic systems and minimize the impact on its flight schedule.</p>

          <p>This article delves into why some individuals are more emotionally sensitive and prone to feeling hurt by minor slights or perceived rejection. It explains that heightened sensitivity can be influenced by both genetic predispositions and life experiences, such as past trauma or neglect. The piece discusses the concept of rejection sensitivity and how it can create a self-fulfilling prophecy in relationships. It also offers coping strategies, such as challenging worst-case assumptions and being more discerning about whose opinions truly matter, to help manage these intense emotional responses.</p>

          <p>Horst Mahler, a German man who co-founded the far-left militant group Red Army Faction before becoming a notorious far-right extremist, has died at 89. In his early life, Mahler was a lawyer who defended militants before helping form the violent group. After serving prison time, he switched to the opposite political extreme, later accumulating multiple convictions for Holocaust denial. He fled to Hungary in 2017 to avoid returning to prison but was extradited back to Germany. His life represents a rare and extreme political trajectory in post-war Germany.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is proposing a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) plan to tackle the country's severe housing shortage and rising rents. The legislation aims to streamline building approvals by allowing municipalities to circumvent complex planning laws for new residential projects and by setting automatic approval deadlines. The plan is a response to a construction industry slowdown caused by rising costs and interest rates. While officials hope it will accelerate development, critics express environmental concerns and question whether it will be effective without additional economic stimulus.</p>

This divisive "America First" approach suggests reallocating military resources from Europe and the Middle East to the western Pacific. Critics, including some Republicans and U.S. allies, argue this view oversimplifies global threats and undermines longstanding alliances.
