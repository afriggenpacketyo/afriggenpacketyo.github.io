            <p>A federal judge has rebuked Justice Department attorneys for their inaction in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador. The judge ordered government officials to testify under oath to determine if they are complying with court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from a Salvadoran mega-prison. Abrego Garcia, alleged to be a member of MS-13, was deported despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, and the Supreme Court has instructed the Trump administration to assist in his return.</p>

Carter has denied the allegations, calling them "more of the same nonsense from the gang of conspirators," and his representative stated he does not recall ever meeting Penly.

            <p>A study indicates a decline in disposable vape use in the UK ahead of the government's ban on their sale, scheduled for June 1, 2025. Researchers suggest that users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban, aimed at reducing litter and youth vaping rates. The percentage of young adults primarily using disposable vapes has significantly decreased, while overall vaping usage has plateaued after years of growth. This shift reflects a proactive response to upcoming policy changes.</p>

            <p>The US faces significant hurdles in its attempt to dominate chip manufacturing, despite President Trump's tariff policies aimed at bringing jobs back home. Experts argue that Asia, particularly Taiwan, has a significant lead in producing advanced chips due to decades of experience and a deeply integrated ecosystem. Challenges include a lack of skilled workers, high costs, and inconsistent policies. While initiatives like the US Chips and Science Act aim to incentivize domestic manufacturing, overcoming these obstacles will be a long and complex process.</p>

            <p>US ports are experiencing disruption as a result of President Trump's unpredictable tariff policies, creating uncertainty for logistics and trade-dependent businesses. Supply-chain analysts warn of potential rerouting, uneven port utilization, slowed trade, and job losses. The Port of Los Angeles, heavily reliant on goods from China, is bracing for a "bumpy" ride, as the tariffs threaten to disrupt established trade networks and impact global shipping.</p>

            <p>President Trump signed a healthcare order directing his health department to work with Congress on revamping a law allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, potentially benefiting pharmaceutical companies. The order seeks to delay the timeline for small molecule drugs to become eligible for price negotiations, aligning it with the longer wait for biotech drugs. The executive action comes amid a national security report into the pharmaceutical industry, hinting at potential sector-specific tariffs.</p>

While China will not yield to the US on core interests, Beijing is focused on preparing for potential confrontation rather than seeking it, emphasizing a cautious approach amidst escalating economic tensions.</p>
