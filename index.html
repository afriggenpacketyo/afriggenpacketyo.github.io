            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that AI costs will decrease over time due to rapid advancements and increased competition in the chip market, as detailed in his annual shareholder letter. He highlighted that the current high costs are primarily driven by the dominance of a single chip provider. Jassy emphasized Amazon's commitment to investing aggressively in AI, foreseeing its transformative impact on customer experiences. He also noted Amazon's strong financial performance in 2024, with significant revenue growth across its North America, International, and AWS segments.</p>

            <p>A High Court judge has affirmed that Coleen Rooney's lawyers did not engage in misconduct regarding legal costs in the 'Wagatha Christie' case against Rebekah Vardy. This decision dismisses an appeal by Vardy, who initially sued Rooney for libel after Rooney accused Vardy's Instagram account of leaking private information to the press. The judge originally ordered Vardy to pay 90% of Rooney's legal costs. Vardy's legal team argued that Rooney's costs were disproportionate and that her team had been misleading, but the judge rejected these claims.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's increase of tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian condemned the US for using tariffs as a 'weapon' for selfish gains. Lin stated that this action goes against global interests, while Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on US goods are meant to protect the Chinese economy and international community interests. Trump's move came after China announced it would increase tariffs on all U.S. goods to 84%. Lin added that tariff wars have no winners and that China does not fear them.</p>

            <p>Democrats are internally divided over how to respond to President Trump's tariff policies, debating whether to criticize them outright or acknowledge some merits of protectionism. Some Democrats argue that tariffs are a middle-class tax hike that risks recession, while others suggest that acknowledging the failures of free trade is necessary to win over working-class voters. The public's view on trade has shifted, with increasing disapproval of tariffs. Ultimately, Democrats need to focus on the economic pain caused by the tariffs and emphasize the need for fair trade practices.</p>

            <p>This article discusses President Trump's overuse of national emergencies, including declaring an emergency over trade. The use of emergency powers is not unique to Trump and allows presidents to circumvent Congress. This power is ripe for abuse, especially since post-9/11 presidents have claimed to have inherent constitutional powers. It is important to put limits on the president's power to declare national emergencies.</p>

            <h2>Pain Pathway Model in Lab May Help Drug Development</h2>

            <p>Scientists have successfully recreated a pain pathway in a laboratory setting by growing four key clusters of human nerve cells in a dish. This model could help explain pain syndromes and offer a new way to test analgesic drugs. The model mimics the signaling chain from the skin to the brain after exposure to painful stimuli. Testing the model with capsaicin showed the information traveling through the pathway, and cells with genetic variants linked to abnormal pain perception showed heightened sensitivity.</p>
