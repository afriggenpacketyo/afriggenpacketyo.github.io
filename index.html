          <p>Apple's second fiscal-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street predictions, although its Services division fell slightly short of estimates. The company reported earnings per share of $1.65 and revenue of $95.4 billion, exceeding expectations. CEO Tim Cook addressed the impact of tariffs, estimating a $900 million cost for the current quarter and stating that Apple is already sourcing a significant portion of iPhones for the U.S. from India and other products from Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts. The company's board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases and declared a dividend of 26 cents per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed concerns about rising prices due to tariffs, suggesting Americans might need fewer imported goods. He stated that children might have "two dolls instead of 30" and that these dolls might cost "a couple of bucks more." White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller argued Americans would be willing to pay more for American-made goods, even if it means higher prices. Trump defended his tariff plan as necessary to combat unfair trade deficits and boost domestic manufacturing, despite warnings from businesses about potential price hikes and product shortages.</p>

          <p>The death toll from sectarian violence in Syria has exceeded 100, according to a war monitoring group, after unrest spread to new areas. Clashes erupted in Jaramana following an audio clip insulting the Prophet Muhammad, leading to attacks by Sunni Muslim extremist groups on Druse populations. Druse militias responded, and the government sent forces to quell the unrest. The violence has raised fears of further fracturing the country, where religious minorities have felt vulnerable since the overthrow of the Assad dictatorship.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported a significant sales drop at U.S. restaurants in its first-quarter earnings report, attributing it to economic uncertainty and diminished consumer sentiment. CEO Chris Kempczinski stated that "heightened anxiety" about the economy, largely driven by tariffs, is weighing on lower-income Americans. The company's same-store sales in the U.S. declined 3.6%, marking the biggest decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and business operations. Kempczinski added that traffic to U.S. restaurants fell more sharply than anticipated, indicating caution about the overall health of the consumer.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a deal that would significantly weaken oversight of religious schools, potentially benefiting the Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal raises concerns among education experts, including State Education Commissioner Betty Rosa, who views such changes as a "travesty" for children in religious schools lacking basic secular education. The potential changes would apply to all private schools but are chiefly relevant to Hasidic schools, which largely conduct religious lessons in Yiddish and Hebrew. The state is also considering lowering the standards schools must meet to demonstrate compliance with the law.</p>

          <h2>State Department Accused of Witch Hunt Targeting Critics of Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top Trump appointee at the State Department, Darren Beattie, is accused of ordering an aggressive investigation into individuals and organizations critical of the administration. Beattie allegedly requested staff emails and records related to figures like Christopher Krebs, Bill Gates, and Anne Applebaum, as well as communications mentioning Trump or his associates. The goal was reportedly to create "transparency" and reveal collusion between these groups and American diplomats. The move has been likened to Soviet-style political policing and has sparked concerns about chilling contact between the State Department and those deemed politically impure.</p>

          <p>David Brooks discusses the rise of a "pagan" ethos characterized by power, manliness, and ego, exemplified by figures like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping. He argues that this dehumanizing value system threatens democracy by dismissing human equality and compassion. Brooks advocates for rehumanizing oneself through art, literature, and acts of service, highlighting the importance of humane education and moral traditions that stand against paganism. He suggests a growing spiritual yearning in response to the failures of science, technology, and hyperindividualism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed lawsuits against Hawaii and Michigan over their planned legal action against fossil fuel companies for climate harm. The DOJ claims the states' actions conflict with federal authority and President Trump’s energy dominance agenda. The suits argue that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA authority to regulate air emissions, preempting states from regulating greenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders. Legal experts have raised concerns about the government's arguments, calling it an aggressive move in support of the fossil fuel industry and an intimidation tactic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's standards for investigating sexual assault reports and sexual harassment complaints will remain unchanged, according to a senior official. This assurance comes as the Pentagon launches a department-wide review into how discrimination claims are handled in general. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called on service secretaries to review equal opportunity programs to ensure discrimination complaints aren't being "weaponized" by disgruntled employees. Advocates expressed concern that Hegseth’s directive would discourage people from reporting misconduct. The number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year.</p>

The case is one of several involving the Trump administration's immigration policies before the Supreme Court. A response from the National TPS Alliance is due May 8.</p>
