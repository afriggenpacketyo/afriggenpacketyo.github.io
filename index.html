          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK as the leader of its "Doge team" after resigning for two days, citing exhaustion from 11 months of building the party. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf regretted his actions, attributing them to overwork. Yusuf explained his initial departure was due to exhaustion and a desire to reassess his priorities after dedicating nearly a year to the party. He will now take on a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media to promote Reform UK's policies. Optimism surrounding the party's future appears to have influenced his decision to return.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that his client's due process rights have been violated, as he was deported before being given a chance to defend himself. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in an alien smuggling ring that transported migrants, including MS-13 members, from Latin America to the U.S.</p>

The SPCA of Wake County removed the dogs, which were surrounded by waste and packed into cages, with many suffering from skin and dental issues. The homeowner surrendered 21 chickens in addition to the dogs, and the SPCA is providing medical care and placing the dogs in foster homes before they are put up for adoption.

To address this, Ramsey recommends creating a savings benchmark, setting a higher savings rate, and prioritizing retirement savings to ensure a more comfortable financial future.
