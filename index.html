          <p>Federal and local authorities are investigating a deadly incident where a Mexican navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge. The ship lost power while departing the South Street Seaport, causing it to drift backward and collide with the bridge, resulting in the snapping of its masts. Two people were killed and at least 19 others were injured, though officials confirmed the bridge's structural integrity remained intact. Senator Schumer has raised concerns about potential impacts from Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts on Coast Guard operations, specifically regarding the functionality of the vehicle traffic service (VTS).</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer José Alvarado received an 80-game suspension following a positive test for external testosterone under MLB’s drug-testing program. Alvarado claimed the positive test stemmed from a weight loss drug taken during the offseason, a claim Phillies president Dave Dombrowski seems to believe. The suspension renders Alvarado ineligible for the postseason and will cost him half of his $9 million salary this year. The Phillies will need to find alternative closing options, potentially including Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering, to compensate for Alvarado's absence.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone bombardment on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, resulting in casualties and injuries as the war escalates. The attack, involving hundreds of drones and decoys, occurred just before President Trump is expected to speak with President Putin about a potential cease-fire. Ukrainian officials argue these attacks demonstrate Putin's disinterest in peace, while Zelensky met with Vice President Vance in Rome, signaling a potential thaw in relations after previous tensions. Ukraine's air defenses intercepted numerous drones, but the attacks are intended to exhaust these defenses for future missile bombardments.</p>

          <p>New Jersey faces a transportation crisis as a locomotive engineers' strike shuts down NJ Transit rail service, exacerbating existing problems with sinkholes on Interstate 80 and ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport.

Residents express frustration with the disruptions, which are impacting their ability to travel and maintain their daily routines.

Arnaz insisted that he play Lucille Ball's husband on TV, challenging the prevailing prejudice against Latinos. He and Ball toured the country to prove their chemistry, and Arnaz's innovation in filming "I Love Lucy" in front of a live audience led to the creation of the rerun and syndication markets. Arnaz's success as an actor and executive rewrote the rules of stardom and demonstrated the importance of diversity in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pursuing a Middle East strategy that is increasingly sidelining Israel, evident in his engagement with Syria's new leader and the lifting of sanctions, actions opposed by Prime Minister Netanyahu. Trump's focus on negotiating peace deals with Iran and Yemen, as well as pursuing business deals with Gulf nations, highlights a shift in U.S. priorities. Despite assurances that the U.S. remains committed to Israel, the change in diplomatic fortunes has raised concerns among Israeli officials, particularly regarding Trump's approach to Iran and the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes swept through parts of the Midwest and South, resulting in widespread destruction and at least 26 fatalities across Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia.

          <p>President Trump's chief Iran negotiator, Steve Witkoff, has clarified the administration's stance on negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, stating that Tehran must give up all enrichment of nuclear fuel. Witkoff emphasized that even a minimal enrichment capability is unacceptable, as it could enable weaponization. He anticipates a fourth negotiating session with Iran in Europe this week, awaiting their response to a U.S. proposal. This position appears to leave little room for compromise, as Iran maintains its right to enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>
