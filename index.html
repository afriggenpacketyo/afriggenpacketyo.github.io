          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any peace deal that excludes Kyiv, calling potential agreements made directly between Presidents Trump and Putin "dead solutions." His statement comes as the two leaders plan to meet in Alaska, where Trump has suggested a deal might involve "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that any lasting peace requires his country's direct participation at the negotiating table.</p>

Nunez, who joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial fee of £64 million, has signed a three-year contract with the Saudi club. During his time with Liverpool, he scored 40 goals in 143 appearances but had limited starting opportunities in their recent title-winning season, prompting the move.</p>

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit accusing the PAC of bribery, while O'Rourke countered with his own suit alleging political suppression.</p>

          <p>This article examines the transformation of Kashmir's portrayal in India's Hindi-language film industry, known as Bollywood. Initially depicted as a romantic, idyllic paradise, the region's cinematic image shifted dramatically with the rise of anti-India militancy in the late 1980s, becoming a backdrop for conflict and patriotism. More recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," reflect the current political climate, often aligning with government narratives and sparking debate over their one-sided perspectives.</p>

          <p>Six Lebanese soldiers were killed in an explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon. The soldiers were inspecting the facility and dismantling its contents as part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement that requires the Lebanese army to confiscate unauthorized weapons. The incident highlights the immense power wielded by the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which functions as both a major political party and a heavily armed group stronger than the national army.</p>

          <p>This article details the severe environmental challenges confronting the Mediterranean Sea, including plastic pollution, overfishing, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report dwindling catches and nets filled with plastic waste, blaming industrial trawlers and untreated sewage for destroying marine ecosystems. While regional governments are proposing solutions like coastal restoration and fishing regulations, local communities remain skeptical, urging for more effective enforcement to save their livelihoods.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at the Republican 'Redmap' Gerrymandering Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 12:16:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of modern gerrymandering, tracing its roots to the 2010 Republican "Redmap" project. This strategy targeted and won key state legislative races, allowing the GOP to control the redistricting process after the 2010 census and create highly partisan maps that entrenched their power for a decade. The piece explains how this has insulated conservative lawmakers from voters, impacted national politics, and set the stage for the current partisan battles over electoral maps.</p>

          <p>In a strange diplomatic exchange, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award to President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, intended for a senior CIA official. The award, a Soviet-era Order of Lenin, was for the official's 21-year-old son, who was killed in 2024 while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The son, who had reportedly struggled with mental health issues, was never a CIA employee and had expressed pro-Russian views online before his death.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has detailed its proposed system for compensating survivors of clergy sexual abuse as part of its bankruptcy settlement. A "point" system will assign value to each claim based on the severity of the abuse, such as 75 points for sexual assault, with additional points for life impact. While the total settlement could be worth up to $235 million, many survivors and their attorneys are urging a "no" vote, arguing the plan is insufficient.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. This move is seen by James's office as a "weaponization of the justice system" and political retribution for her successful litigation against the Trump Organization. The investigation into James is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, escalating the political and legal battle between the Trump administration and the state's top law enforcement official.</p>

          <p>According to newly released official documents, a Royal Navy nuclear weapons base at Coulport, Scotland, repeatedly leaked radioactive water into a nearby loch. The leaks, which included low levels of tritium, were caused by old, poorly maintained pipes that burst on multiple occasions. While the Scottish Environment Protection Agency stated the risk was of "no regulatory concern," the files reveal significant shortfalls in maintenance at the depot, which stores the UK's Trident nuclear warheads.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a new Republican push for partisan gerrymandering in states like Texas, Democratic leaders are adopting a more aggressive, retaliatory stance. Governors in California, New York, and Illinois have declared their intent to redraw their own state's maps to neutralize any GOP advantage, signaling a departure from previous calls for nonpartisan reform. This "fight fire with fire" approach reflects a growing sentiment within the party that they must use every available tool to combat what they see as an authoritarian threat to democracy.</p>
