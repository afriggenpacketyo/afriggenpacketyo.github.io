          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of neurotech implant patients being abandoned after receiving life-changing technology, highlighting the story of Jennifer French, who received electrodes to help her walk after a spinal injury. While French was fortunate enough to have continued support from Case Western researchers, many others have not been so lucky. Journalist Liam Drew has been reporting on this phenomenon for eight years, emphasizing the need for the burgeoning neurotech industry to prevent future abandonment of patients, as the podcast 'Unexplainable' also explores these patients' stories and the industry's potential solutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war is extending to the golf cart industry, impacting companies like Club Car and E-Z-Go, which assemble their carts in the U.S. but source components globally, including from China. While the U.S. International Trade Commission is considering tariffs on Chinese-made golf carts, the broader tariffs could force domestic companies to raise prices or sacrifice profit margins. The golf cart market is projected to grow, but tariffs will create challenges for manufacturers relying on foreign components, illustrating the complexities of global supply chains and the potential risks for American manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with GDP shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate, largely attributed to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. This slowdown, the worst since early 2022, has raised concerns about a potential recession, although economists caution that the surge in imports may skew the figures. The report also notes a decline in government spending, particularly due to cuts implemented by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, further impacting economic growth.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Deportation Policies Face Scrutiny Over Treatment of Venezuelan Migrants</h2>

          <p>New details have emerged concerning the Trump administration's deportation policies, particularly regarding Venezuelan migrants, revealing that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, sought assurances that deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to expedite deportations has faced criticism, especially after reports that migrants were deported with flimsy evidence and without due process. The arrangement with El Salvador, which involves housing migrants in a maximum-security prison, raises questions about human rights and the extent of U.S. oversight.</p>

          <h2>Trump Defends Tariffs, Blames Biden for Economic Downturn</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has attributed the recent economic contraction to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while defending his administration's sweeping tariffs, claiming that his promised 'boom' will take time to materialize. Trump's comments follow the release of data indicating a decline in gross domestic product and a weaker-than-expected increase in private payrolls, prompting concerns about the impact of his trade policies. However, economic analysts have pointed out that the GDP figures reflect companies' efforts to import goods ahead of the tariffs, and that cuts in government spending also contributed to the downturn.</p>

          <p>A new study by Aon suggests that GLP-1 medications, used for diabetes and weight loss, can lead to lower medical costs for employers within two years, despite their high initial price. Researchers found that patients taking GLP-1 drugs experienced improved health outcomes, including a significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events and the onset of diabetes, leading to a 7% reduction in the medical cost trend. Aon has launched a subsidized GLP-1 weight management program for its own workforce, highlighting the potential for economic returns on providing insurance coverage for these medications.</p>

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their manufacturing operations in the U.S. since President Trump's second term began, coinciding with the implementation of new tariffs. While not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the primary motivator, the White House promotes these moves as advancing Trump's job-creation agenda. Economists suggest that factors such as labor costs, tax rates, and the regulatory environment also play significant roles in companies' decisions, and that broad-based tariffs may not effectively foster job growth compared to narrowly targeted measures.</p>

          <p>The NFL has imposed significant fines on the Atlanta Falcons and their defensive coordinator, Jeff Ulbrich, after Ulbrich's son, Jax, made a prank call to Shedeur Sanders during the NFL Draft. Jax Ulbrich admitted to obtaining Sanders's number from his father's iPad and impersonating a New Orleans Saints general manager. The NFL fined Jeff Ulbrich $100,000 and the Falcons $250,000 for failing to prevent the disclosure of confidential information distributed to the club in advance of the NFL draft. Sanders, who was eventually drafted by the Cleveland Browns, expressed that the prank did not significantly affect him.</p>
