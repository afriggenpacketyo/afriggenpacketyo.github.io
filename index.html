          <p>Ahead of President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the U.S. military conducted a significant display of air power, including a flyover by a B-2 stealth bomber and four F-35 fighter jets. The B-2 bombers, symbols of American global strike capability, were flown to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for the event, which also featured F-22 Raptors lining the tarmac. This show of force occurred as the two leaders met to discuss the war in Ukraine, though it was not immediately clear if the president personally ordered the demonstration.</p>

          <p>Former first lady Michelle Obama has commented on the WNBA rivalry between Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, highlighting the negative impact of social media on the athletes. Speaking on a podcast, she noted that while intense rivalries are part of sports, the constant presence of online "hate" creates an exceptionally difficult environment for today's young athletes. Obama emphasized that this phenomenon is not unique to the WNBA but affects sports across genders, making it harder for players to withstand the barrage of public opinion.</p>

          <p>A tech analyst has described potential government intervention in chipmaker Intel as "essential" for U.S. national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. The move aims to revive the struggling firm and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This consideration comes as President Trump advocates for increased domestic production of high-end technology, with discussions reportedly involving funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the investment.

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit to challenge President Trump's executive order placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The suit calls the move a "brazenly unlawful" and "hostile takeover" that infringes on the district's right to self-governance. Officials are seeking a temporary restraining order to block the directive, which installed the head of the DEA as the chief of the D.C. police. The administration has defended its action by citing a purported crime emergency, a claim D.C. officials dispute with data showing declining crime rates.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from director Zach Cregger, is being praised for its daring narrative, which provides clear answers to its central mystery about a group of children who mysteriously vanish. The article explores how the film successfully builds suspense before revealing a supernatural villain, leading to a satisfying and cathartic climax where the antagonist is defeated. However, the review also highlights that the movie subverts simple resolution by showing that vanquishing evil does not erase the profound trauma and grief experienced by the characters and their community.</p>

In response to the report, a Meta spokesperson stated that the cited examples were erroneous, inconsistent with company policy, and have since been removed from its training documents.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation projects the state-by-state impact of President Trump's recent tax legislation, revealing significant variation in benefits for taxpayers. In 2026, the average individual taxpayer is expected to save $3,752, with residents in states like Wyoming, Washington, and Massachusetts seeing the largest average cuts. The report also highlights that high-income areas, such as resort towns like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, could see disproportionately large tax breaks, while rural counties and lower-income households may experience smaller benefits or even financial shortfalls.

          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season less predictable and profitable than in previous years, forcing them to make more strategic adjustments to their flight schedules. Carriers have reduced their August capacity as travelers shift vacations to earlier in the summer or to the fall, and economic uncertainty has led to last-minute bookings. These changes, combined with rising labor costs, have prompted airlines to cut flights to maintain profitability, which is expected to contribute to higher airfares for consumers despite a challenging operational environment.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks President Trump's recent claims that crime is "out of control" in Washington, D.C., which he used to justify placing the city's police force under federal control. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has fallen significantly in 2024. Data from the city's police department and independent analyses show a notable decrease in violent crime this year, suggesting that the president's characterization overstates the current situation by focusing on past peaks.</p>

However, worrisome signals persist, including weak job creation and an acceleration in wholesale prices, suggesting that the risks of stagnant growth and rising inflation remain a significant concern for the coming months.

          <p>This article delves into Muriel Spark's classic novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," highlighting the author's profound understanding of adolescence and moral development. The story centers on a charismatic but manipulative teacher in 1930s Edinburgh and the lasting impact she has on a select group of her students, particularly one named Sandy. The review explores how Spark uses the narrative to investigate themes of influence, betrayal, and the search for authority, ultimately framing a young person's religious conversion as a final, complex act of separation from a powerful childhood mentor.</p>
