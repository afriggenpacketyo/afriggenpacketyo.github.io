          <p>A 42-year-old man stabbed 11 people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, leaving six individuals in critical condition. The attack, which occurred near the checkout area, appears to have been random, according to the Grand Traverse Sheriff's Office. The suspect was apprehended at the scene with assistance from citizens, and officials, including the governor and the FBI, are investigating what is being called a brutal act of violence.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent national division. This development follows an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups aiming to establish a secular state, while the UN warns it could fragment Sudan further.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The trial centered on conflicting narratives: the prosecution argued she killed him to win a custody battle, while the defense claimed self-defense after a history of alleged abuse. The case involved a complex relationship, accusations of poisoning, and testimony from family, culminating in a verdict that rejected second-degree murder but found her actions unjustified.</p>

          <p>With England fans facing a nerve-wracking Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions that come with watching high-stakes sports. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause increased heart rate and anxiety, but experts say it's a normal sign of caring deeply. To manage the stress, they advise getting rest, having a clear plan for the day, and reframing the experience as an enjoyable opportunity for emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average temperatures in July running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While not record-breaking, the persistent cool temperatures are a notable deviation from typical summer patterns, though experts caution that the region's hottest months are often still to come in September and October.</p>
