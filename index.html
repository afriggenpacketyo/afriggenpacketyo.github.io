            <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a sharp decline of approximately 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, a response to President Trump's sweeping levies. The price drop reflects market anxieties about a potential full-blown trade war that could trigger a global recession, thereby reducing crude oil demand. Simultaneously, OPEC+ has agreed to accelerate output in May, adding to the existing oil surplus. The collision of recession fears and growing oil supply is creating a challenging environment for the oil market. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent articulated President Trump's focus on revitalizing Main Street businesses and empowering consumers, following a period of significant wealth accumulation on Wall Street. Bessent acknowledged the potential for economic recession due to the administration's tariffs, but emphasized that the agenda is designed to boost hiring, investment, and the American Dream for Main Street. He outlined plans to de-leverage the government sector and re-leverage the private sector, while advocating for tax reforms like eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security, and overtime. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, however, expressed concerns that the trade battle could lead the U.S. economy into a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on goods from major trading partners, including China and the EU, has triggered widespread disruption and uncertainty for businesses. China has retaliated with its own tariffs, escalating the trade war and shaking global markets. The tariffs, affecting over $2 trillion in imports, could lead to significant price increases for consumers and potential economic damage as trade shrinks and production falls. While the White House suggests possible trade talks, businesses are halting shipments and expressing concern about the unpredictable economic landscape.</p>

The reluctance stems from the importance placed on maintaining and growing endowments as a symbol of prestige and financial stability. However, some argue that universities have a responsibility to use their resources to defend academic freedom and resist what they see as unjust government interference.

            <p>With persistent inflation impacting savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a potential solution for earning higher returns. Current CD rates can surpass the inflation rate, providing an opportunity to lock in high rates for the term of the CD. Strategies for securing favorable rates include exploring online banks, which often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs, which may have higher interest rates than longer-term options. Laddering CDs, by investing in various terms, can also help optimize savings for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Global bond markets experienced volatility as President Trump's tariffs prompted investors to seek safe haven assets. While U.S. Treasurys sold off, German bonds rose in value, as investors viewed Germany as an alternative safe haven. Concerns about the U.S. dollar's trustworthiness and potential responses from countries like China are contributing to the shift. Freya Beamish of TS Lombard likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.'s 2022 "mini budget" crisis, highlighting the potential for negative supply shocks to destabilize markets.
