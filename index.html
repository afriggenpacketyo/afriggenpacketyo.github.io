          <p>Several Trump administration officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mehmet Oz, Brooke Rollins, and Scott Turner, advocate for requiring able-bodied adults to work, participate in job training, or volunteer to receive welfare benefits. They argue that welfare should be a short-term hand-up rather than a lifelong handout, emphasizing that work provides purpose, dignity, and strengthens communities. The officials point to the success of the 1996 welfare reform under President Clinton as evidence that work requirements can reduce dependency and poverty. The proposed changes aim to prioritize the vulnerable and rebuild thriving communities while protecting taxpayer dollars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that weight-loss medications, specifically GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and bariatric surgery are linked to reduced risk of obesity-related cancers (ORC). Researchers found that GLP-1 RAs have a 41% relative risk reduction for ORC compared to bariatric surgery, suggesting additional pathways beyond weight loss contribute to this decreased risk. Experts note that GLP-1 RAs reduce inflammation, a known risk factor for various cancers, and improve metabolic health by lowering blood glucose levels and decreasing insulin resistance. The study suggests that weight reduction and inflammation reduction play important roles in cancer prevention, emphasizing the need for a healthy lifestyle.</p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court ruled that the European Commission should not have denied a journalist’s request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer’s CEO during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The case revolved around whether texts between a top E.U. official and a drug company executive counted as a public record that might need to be disclosed. The court said the commission must provide credible explanations for why requested documents cannot be found and why text messages exchanged in the context of the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines did not contain important information.

In early April, the president proposed tariffs that in the long run could also have an impact on the clean energy industry — particularly those targeting Southeast Asia, a region where countries are facing some of the highest figures. Even though the president has since put the brakes on many of the tariffs for 90 days, that, along with the funding freezes and anti-renewables rhetoric, is "injecting uncertainty into the future trajectory of the place for clean tech in the United States."</p>
