          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California’s authority to set three mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, signaling a broader resentment towards the state's influence. For decades, California has set its own stringent pollution limits, prompting many Democratic-led states to adopt these standards. Republicans argue that California's policies, like the mandate to ban gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, are impractical for their constituents. They view the move as a statement that liberal California should not dictate national policy.</p>

Despite this, Trump has refused to join Europe in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or offer new arms to Ukraine. This pattern involves Trump signaling a pullback from the conflict, expressing shock at Putin's actions, and then refusing to take meaningful action.

          <p>President Trump's Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery honored military veterans but also included personal boasting and partisan remarks. While paying tribute to fallen soldiers, Trump veered off into rally-style comments, talking about "fixing" the republic and criticizing immigration policies. He also promoted the upcoming celebration of the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary. Trump's remarks drew attention to his plans and achievements while making veiled swipes at his political opponents.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed 50 percent tariffs on the European Union until July 9, aiming to kick-start discussions and reach a trade deal. Officials from both sides are set to begin a new negotiating push. However, significant differences in priorities and demands remain, potentially hindering a rapid agreement. European negotiators are hesitant to agree to many of Mr. Trump’s frequent demands, including changes to their consumption tax system and digital regulations.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles, once a mainstay a century ago, face potential setbacks due to political and social factors. The Trump administration and Republicans are working to undercut the growth of electric vehicles and swing federal policy in favor of oil and gasoline. Gender stereotypes, with electric cars being seen as feminine, and alignment with conservative politics have also created challenges. While electric car sales are growing globally, U.S. sales are more modest, highlighting the industry's uncertain future.</p>

          <p>Analysts warn investors to "buckle up" for continued volatility despite President Trump's delay of 50% tariffs on the European Union. Trump's announcement has granted the two parties some more breathing space, but market watchers warned that a lot remains at stake. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding said the six-week window until tariffs kick in was probably not enough time to "settle all detailed questions." Uncertainty remains, and the potential for a trade war has not completely dissipated.</p>
