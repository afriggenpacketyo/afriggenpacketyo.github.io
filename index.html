          <p>The Italian food giant Ferrero Group has announced its intention to purchase WK Kellogg Co. in a cash deal valued at approximately $3.1 billion. This acquisition will bring iconic cereal brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops under the same ownership as Nutella and Rocher chocolates. The deal encompasses Kellogg's U.S., Canadian, and Caribbean cereal operations, aiming to expand Ferrero's presence in North America. Following the transaction, which is expected to close in late 2025, WK Kellogg will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the country's only operational rare earth miner, through a $400 million investment. This strategic move aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earths, which are crucial for military technology like F-35 jets and drones, reducing reliance on China. The investment will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet production, including a new facility fully backed by a 10-year Pentagon purchase agreement. This public-private partnership caused the company's shares to surge significantly upon the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An officer from Ukraine's security service (SBU), identified by media as Colonel Ivan Voronych, was shot and killed in Kyiv. The incident is being investigated as a targeted assassination, part of a pattern of such attacks since Russia's full-scale invasion. Security footage reportedly shows the attack, in which the officer was shot five times with a silenced pistol. Pro-Kremlin military bloggers have celebrated the killing, suggesting Russian involvement and framing it as retaliation for alleged Ukrainian sabotage operations.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own specialized cooling equipment, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to manage the intense heat generated by next-generation Nvidia AI processors. This development was necessary because existing commercial solutions were inadequate for the scale of AWS's operations, and building new liquid-cooled data centers would have taken too long. The new hardware allows AWS to efficiently integrate powerful Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems into its data centers. This move continues Amazon's strategy of creating custom infrastructure to reduce reliance on third parties and improve profitability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has named his transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, as the interim head of NASA. This appointment follows the withdrawal of billionaire Jared Isaacman's nomination, whom Trump reportedly discovered was a Democrat.

The move is viewed as a signal of Trump's intent to push through these cuts, raising concerns about the future of U.S. space exploration.</p>

The inquiry found a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted kidnappings or assassinations against regime opponents in the UK since early 2022. The committee criticized the government for a reactive, "fire-fighting" approach and urged a more robust, long-term strategy.

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear," explores the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive, innovative, and ultimately unsustainable PA system from the early 1970s. Conceived by sound engineer Owsley Stanley, the system aimed to provide perfect, uniform audio for the entire audience by placing a literal wall of speakers behind the band. While it achieved unprecedented clarity for some, the logistical nightmare and immense cost of the elephant-sized rig contributed to the band's eventual hiatus in 1974. The article reflects on this quest for technical perfection, contrasting the Wall's hubris with the modern, controlled audio of venues like the Sphere.</p>

          <p>A search and rescue operation is underway for more than a dozen crew members of the Greek-owned cargo ship Eternity C, which was attacked by Yemen's Houthi rebels. The attack, involving gunfire and explosive drones, reportedly killed at least three sailors and led to the ship sinking. Six of the 25 crew members have been rescued after spending over 24 hours in the water, while the U.S. has accused the Houthis of kidnapping several others. This incident marks the second cargo vessel sunk by the Iran-backed group in recent days as they continue to target ships in the region.</p>

          <p>The American neo-fascist group Patriot Front has been seen in central Texas, claiming to be providing disaster relief following recent devastating floods. In videos posted online, the group's leader, Thomas Rousseau, stated they were distributing supplies to survivors but specified they were prioritizing "European peoples." Experts on extremism note that this tactic of appearing at disaster sites is a common ploy used by hate groups to launder their image, present themselves as helpful community members, and recruit new followers. The group's presence follows a recent march in Louisville, Kentucky, where they carried a Confederate banner.</p>

Ministers, including Saudi Arabia's Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, advocated for a pragmatic approach to the green transition, arguing that hydrocarbons will remain essential for the global economy for decades. OPEC's latest World Oil Outlook projects that oil demand will continue to grow through 2050, requiring an estimated $18.2 trillion in investment. The group also cited low inventories and a stable global economy as justification for recent decisions to increase production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy see widespread use, new and potentially severe side effects are being reported beyond the common digestive issues. Medical professionals are concerned about links to conditions such as acute pancreatitis, which has been associated with at least ten deaths in the UK, as well as musculoskeletal disorders and vision problems. While these GLP-1 drugs were deemed safe in clinical trials, their use by a much larger population is revealing rarer adverse reactions.

          <p>Former "MasterChef" host Gregg Wallace is facing criticism after he appeared to link his recent autism diagnosis to allegations of misconduct made against him. After dozens of people accused him of inappropriate comments and touching, which he denies, Wallace stated that TV bosses failed to protect him in what he now realizes was a "dangerous environment" for his neurodiversity. Disability charities and advocacy groups have responded by stating that autism is "not a free pass for bad behaviour" and warned that his comments risk stigmatizing the autistic community. Wallace has been sacked from the show and reportedly plans to sue for discrimination.</p>

The state's budget is highly dependent on oil revenue, creating significant fiscal instability. In addition to its weak economy, Alaska also ranks poorly for infrastructure, particularly its lack of broadband access, and has a notoriously high cost of living, further hindering its business competitiveness.

          <p>A comprehensive review of Los Angeles history reveals that the city's current, unprecedented homelessness crisis is the result of a century of specific policy decisions, not an inevitability. The crisis began to take shape in the late 1970s, as a confluence of factors created a severe shortage of affordable housing. Key events included the halt of public housing construction, the demolition of thousands of single-room occupancy hotel units, and the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs. These were compounded by the deinstitutionalization of mental healthcare without adequate community support and skyrocketing housing prices, making the city unable to house its most vulnerable residents.</p>
