          <p>National Guard troops have arrived in Los Angeles following escalating tensions between law enforcement and protesters over President Trump's immigration enforcement operations. Protests have erupted throughout L.A. County, leading to clashes and arrests. Trump has deployed the guard in response to what he calls "two days of violence, clashes, and unrest," while Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as "purposefully inflammatory." Representative Maxine Waters has called Trump's action a "disruption," while officials urge calm and peaceful assembly. The optimism score reflects the serious nature of the event, and the potential for further escalation. </p>
