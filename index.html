          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, former attorney for Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed in January 2021, accused Giuliani of promoting false claims about Dominion's voting machines following the 2020 presidential election. This resolution comes shortly after Dominion also settled a similar case with another former Trump attorney, Sidney Powell. The court filing indicates a voluntary dismissal of the case, with each party agreeing to cover their own legal fees, but further details of the settlement remain undisclosed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that chimpanzees in the wild frequently consume fermented fruit, ingesting notable quantities of alcohol. A study published by Science found that chimps in Uganda and the Ivory Coast consume a daily dose equivalent to a small bottle of beer for a human. This behavior, observed across different chimpanzee populations, suggests that alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots shared by humans and their closest relatives, rather than being a purely human cultural phenomenon. Researchers suggest these findings support the idea that the use of ethanol has long played a role in primate societies.</p>

          <p>The FBI has arrested a Texas man, Joshua Cole, for allegedly making online threats to commit a mass shooting at a Pride parade in Abilene. According to court documents, Cole posted comments on Facebook under an alias, calling for violence to "pay them back" for the recent murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. During questioning after his arrest, Cole reportedly admitted to making the threatening posts and agreed that a reasonable person could interpret them as a threat. Authorities stated the threats were specific and unconditional, leading to his arrest on federal charges for threatening communications.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal facilities, particularly an ICE processing center he claims is under siege by "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." In a social media post, Trump stated he was authorizing the use of "full force, if necessary," a move that has drawn immediate criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson both asserted that federal intervention is unnecessary, with the mayor stating the required number of troops is zero. The announcement marks an expansion of troop deployments in American cities.</p>

          <p>A retired FBI task force investigator asserts that convicted serial killer Joseph Naso, known as the "Alphabet Killer," may have modeled his crimes after Caryl Chessman, an executed death row inmate. Naso, convicted of murdering four women with alliterative names, was reportedly a pen pal of Chessman's and was invited to his 1960 execution. This theory is explored in a new docuseries, which also features a fellow inmate to whom Naso allegedly confessed to killing 26 people. The investigation suggests Naso's specific targeting of victims was a twisted homage to Chessman, whom he considered an idol.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen FBI agents were fired on Friday, reportedly including some who were photographed kneeling during racial justice protests in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd. Some of the agents had been reassigned earlier this year in what were seen as demotions, and their initial actions had drawn sharp criticism from right-wing figures. The FBI Agents Association condemned the firings as violations of due process, stating the actions weaken the Bureau by eliminating expertise and damaging morale. The FBI declined to comment on personnel matters, and the specific agents fired have not been independently confirmed.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country on Earth, a distinction many Finns find surprising. Experts suggest the ranking is based less on overt joy and more on a deep sense of contentment derived from a society that provides strong social support. The World Happiness Report measures how close citizens feel their life is to the best possible life. Finland's success is attributed to factors like accessible public services, a strong social safety net funded by high taxes, a close connection to nature, and cultural practices like sauna use that promote well-being.</p>

          <p>A Tesla registered to musician D4vd was ticketed for a 72-hour parking violation eleven days before the body of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez was discovered in its trunk. The car had been parked on a Hollywood Hills street long enough for residents to complain, leading to the citation on September 3 and its impoundment two days later. The decomposing remains were found by a tow yard worker on September 8. This new detail in the timeline is a key focus for detectives as they investigate how long the car was parked and when the teenager's body was placed inside.</p>

          <p>The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is operating on emergency diesel generators for a fifth consecutive day, raising significant safety concerns. The plant's external power was cut on Tuesday, marking a record outage for the facility. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has repeatedly warned of the risk of a catastrophe if cooling systems fail. Concurrently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a $90 billion arms agreement with the United States and criticized Hungary for conducting what he termed "dangerous" intelligence drone flights over Ukrainian territory.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating the party's policies "will tear this country apart." Speaking ahead of the Labour party conference, Starmer singled out Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as one of the "most shocking things" the party has said. He positioned the Labour conference as an opportunity to present an alternative to what he described as Reform's "toxic divide and decline." The comments come as Labour faces pressure from polls showing it trailing Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Market strategist David Zervos of Jefferies has warned that the rapid growth of artificial intelligence could pose a significant problem for the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. He suggests a scenario where the economy experiences strong GDP growth driven by AI, but the unemployment rate simultaneously rises due to job displacement. Zervos notes that some top AI experts predict the loss of three to five million jobs within the next few years. This potential disconnect between economic growth and job creation would present a challenging dilemma for the central bank's policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

The order has reportedly caused anxiety among officers, coming after Hegseth's recent firings of several senior officials and his directive to reduce the number of four-star generals.

However, economists warn that this strength could be precarious, as the top 10% of earners own 87% of the market, while broader consumer sentiment remains low. The economy is therefore vulnerable to a downturn if the stock market, which is trading at high valuations, were to reverse its course. (not investment advice)</p>
