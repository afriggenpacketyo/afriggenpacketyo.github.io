          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel has clarified recent comments he made, denying that his distinction between "entertainers and competitors" was a jab at his rookie teammate, Shedeur Sanders. During a preseason game, Gabriel stated his job was to compete, which led to social media speculation that he was referencing the highly publicized Sanders. Gabriel later explained the "entertainers" he referred to were the media, while he and his teammates are the competitors focused on their jobs. Both quarterbacks are currently competing for the starting position on the team.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has been forced to postpone its plans to resume flights after its 10,000 striking flight attendants defied a government back-to-work order. The strike, which began Saturday, has disrupted travel for over 100,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The Canadian Union of Public Employees stated that demonstrations will continue, urging the airline to negotiate a fair contract rather than relying on government intervention. The primary points of contention in the contract dispute remain pay rates and compensation for unpaid work hours. The airline now hopes to resume services by Monday evening.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a crowded nightclub in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries early Sunday morning. New York City police reported that a dispute inside the Taste of the City Lounge escalated, leading to what appears to be a gang-related incident involving up to four gunmen. The deceased victims were men aged 19, 27, and 35. Investigators recovered at least 42 shell casings at the scene and are reviewing security footage, but no arrests have been made. Officials have asked the public for any information that could help identify the shooters.</p>

          <p>A recent online discussion highlights a growing sentiment among millennials and Gen Z that Bitcoin and other digital assets represent their generation's primary wealth-building opportunity, akin to how affordable housing was for Baby Boomers. With the median home price having vastly outpaced income growth over the decades, many younger people feel priced out of the traditional real estate market. Proponents argue that Bitcoin offers advantages like global accessibility, liquidity, and no maintenance costs, positioning it as a form of "digital real estate." Critics, however, point to the cryptocurrency's extreme volatility and lack of physical utility as significant risks. (not investment advice)</p>

The Met defends the technology, stating it is accurate at the settings they use and will help ensure public safety at the large-scale cultural event.</p>

          <p>At least 76 Palestinian students from Gaza, who have secured admission and in many cases full scholarships to top UK universities, are unable to begin their studies because they cannot leave the territory. The primary obstacle is the closure of the UK's biometric registration center in Gaza, which prevents their visa applications from being processed. Despite calls from nearly 5,000 academics and over 100 MPs for the UK government to facilitate their safe passage and offer a biometric deferral, as was done for Ukrainian students, no solution has been implemented.

The host's score was anchored by an unbeaten 64 from Jos Buttler and a late surge from Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 50 not out.

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has shifted his public stance, now arguing that a comprehensive peace agreement should be pursued directly rather than first securing a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. This change aligns Trump with Putin's position and puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who maintains that a ceasefire is a prerequisite for negotiations. Previously, Trump had insisted on a rapid ceasefire as a primary goal of the summit. This pivot raises the stakes for Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to the White House, where he will be joined by several European leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents the case for purchasing Bitcoin, highlighting its fixed supply cap of 21 million units as its most compelling feature. It contrasts this scarcity with the ever-expanding money supply and national debt of countries like the United States, suggesting that ongoing currency debasement will inherently drive up the value of a finite asset. The argument posits that as more fiat currency is created to manage economic crises and stimulus, the price of Bitcoin is positioned for long-term appreciation. The pre-determined "halving" schedule, which slows the creation of new coins, further reinforces this supply-side dynamic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A free-kick goal scored by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed following a VAR review due to a lesser-known rule infringement. The decision was made because a Crystal Palace player was standing less than one meter away from the Chelsea defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to the International Football Association Board's Law 13, which was introduced in 2019, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a wall formed by three or more defenders. The rule was implemented to prevent time-wasting caused by attackers positioning themselves within the wall.</p>

          <p>Award-winning Irish author Sally Rooney has publicly stated she will continue to support the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, even after it was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. In an opinion piece, Rooney declared her intent to use her platform and earnings to support the group's direct action campaigns, stating, "if this makes me a supporter of terror under UK law, so be it." Her statement comes as the UK Home Secretary defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and other disruptive activities as going beyond legitimate protest.</p>

          <h2>Recent Corruption Probes in China Signal End of Political Leniency for Ethnic Minority Officials</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent downfall of several high-ranking officials from ethnic minority communities in China suggests a significant shift in the country's political landscape. Observers note that the corruption investigations into figures like Qizhala, a former Tibetan chairman, and Liu Hui, a former Hui chairwoman, indicate that Beijing is enforcing political discipline more uniformly. This marks a departure from a past tendency to show a degree of leniency toward non-Han officials as part of ethnic inclusion efforts. The crackdown reflects a broader push for party loyalty and control that now appears to transcend ethnic considerations in elite politics.</p>

          <h2>Economists Express Concern Over Rising Inflation Following Hotter-Than-Expected July Data</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 09:30:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic data showing a surge in both producer and consumer prices for July has some economists worried, even as markets remain optimistic about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. The Producer Price Index reached a three-year high, driven largely by services inflation, a trend also seen in the Consumer Price Index. This places the Fed in a difficult position, balancing its mandate for price stability against a potentially softening labor market. While investors are still pricing in a high probability of a rate cut, some economists argue that the broad-based inflationary pressures warrant more restraint. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Putin Emerged as the Winner from the Anchorage Summit with Trump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 09:19:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that Russian President Vladimir Putin achieved his objectives at the recent summit in Anchorage, Alaska, while President Trump returned empty-handed. Putin did not concede to Trump's primary goal of a ceasefire, instead getting Trump to adopt his position that a broader peace agreement must come first. By showing up, Putin undermined Western efforts to isolate him and sowed further distrust between the U.S. and its European allies. The article suggests Putin's offer to freeze the frontline in exchange for the Donbas region is a trap, putting the onus on Ukraine to refuse and appear as the obstacle to peace.</p>

          <p>Mayors of several Democratic-run cities are preparing contingency plans in response to President Trump's increasing rhetoric and actions against them, such as deploying the military in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. City leaders state they are ready to legally challenge any attempts by the federal government to usurp local authority under the pretext of fighting crime or unrest. They argue that Trump is creating a false narrative of "liberal hellholes" to distract from other issues and that federal intervention often escalates tensions. Mayors are coordinating with police chiefs, governors, and legal teams to defend their local control.</p>

          <p>Evie Parts, a transgender long-distance runner, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Swarthmore College, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team due to her gender identity. The lawsuit claims the NCAA, as a private organization, cannot override federal Title IX protections and state law with its policy banning transgender athletes from women's sports. Parts was removed from the team on the same day the new NCAA policy was issued and was allegedly denied coaching and team resources unless she competed with the men's team. She was later reinstated but is seeking damages for the emotional distress caused.</p>
