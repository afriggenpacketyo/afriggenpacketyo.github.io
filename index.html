            <p>Max Verstappen clinched pole position at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after Lando Norris crashed during Q3, disrupting rivals' runs. Despite close competition from Piastri and Russell, Verstappen's strong first sector in his final lap secured him the top spot. Norris's accident, caused by misjudging a chicane, damaged his car, impacting his championship position. Verstappen expressed satisfaction with the car's performance, while Piastri acknowledged the challenge posed by the high-speed circuit and softer tires.</p>

            <p>Many international adoptees in the U.S. are discovering they lack citizenship, facing potential deportation to countries they've never known. This issue stems from adoptive parents not completing naturalization processes, leaving adoptees vulnerable, despite the Child Citizenship Act of 2000. Advocates are pushing for Congress to remove age cutoffs in the law and address the citizenship gap. Non-citizen adoptees face challenges accessing financial aid, federal benefits, and are at risk of deportation for even minor crimes, leading to homelessness and mental health crises.</p>

Ocado stated that the comments were made by a temporary contractor and did not reflect the company's views.

            <p>An opinion piece discusses the historical and cultural trope of the 'wicked stepmother,' suggesting that women should not be deterred from dating parents due to negative stereotypes. The author argues that children are primed to hate their mothers, biological or otherwise, and that the fear of being perceived as a wicked stepmother should not hold back potential relationships. Drawing on fairy tales and psychological theories, the piece encourages mothers to date without fear, as their partner's children likely can't hate them more than their own children inevitably will.</p>

            <p>The United States and Iran held a second round of negotiations in Rome concerning Tehran's nuclear program. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met, mediated by Oman, with plans for further talks in Oman later in April. The discussions aim to ensure Iran does not possess nuclear weapons while maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy. These talks represent a historic moment, given the long-standing tensions between the two countries.</p>

            <p>A survey reveals that people are increasingly frustrated with inefficient customer service systems, spending significant time dealing with issues and being kept on hold. The most frustrating experiences include booking NHS appointments and contacting local council services. The study suggests that this frustration has a political dimension, potentially influencing voters to support parties advocating for systemic change. The problem is both a public and private sector issue, with corporations often outsourcing customer service to cut costs.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's push to expand coal mining while cutting funding for agencies protecting miner health and safety has sparked criticism. Advocates express concern that the cuts, overseen by Elon Musk's unofficial "department of government efficiency", will jeopardize miner well-being, particularly regarding diseases like black lung. The administration also seeks to pause a new rule on silica dust exposure, further alarming health and safety advocates. The cuts are particularly concerning given the increasing prevalence of black lung among younger miners.</p>

            <p>Scientists claim to have discovered a new colour, named "olo," by stimulating specific cells in the retina. The colour, described as a saturated shade of blue-green, cannot be seen by the naked eye without stimulation. Researchers used laser pulses to stimulate cone cells in participants' eyes, resulting in the perception of a colour signal not found in natural vision. While some experts remain skeptical, the research could potentially aid in the study of colour blindness.</p>

            <p>American grandparents are increasingly taking on caregiving roles, leading to changes in their relationships with their children and grandchildren. As grandparents provide more child care for overextended parents, their retirement plans may be altered, and their relationships with their children can become more transactional. While grandparents can offer love, wisdom, and closeness, the increased caregiving responsibilities can strain these bonds if they reach their breaking point. The trend reflects a shift in family dynamics and the challenges of balancing work and family life.</p>
