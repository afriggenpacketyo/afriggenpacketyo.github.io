        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland is gearing up for a presidential election that will determine the fate of the pro-European government's reform plans. The current president, Andrzej Duda, has been blocking the government's initiatives, leading to widespread disappointment. The election pits Rafal Trzaskowski, a left-wing liberal backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, against Karol Nawrocki, a national-conservative supported by the Law and Justice party. The outcome will decide whether Poland continues its current political stalemate or embraces a new direction, with potential implications for the rule of law, LGBTQ+ rights, and EU climate policy. Optimism hinges on the election results and their impact on the country's future.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of homeless individuals are residing in Madrid's international airport due to a growing housing crisis in Spain, particularly in cities like Madrid and Barcelona where rental costs have significantly increased.

A political blame game between city and national authorities has stalled efforts to address the situation, leaving the homeless without adequate assistance or living arrangements.
