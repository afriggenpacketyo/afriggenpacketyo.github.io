          <p>Britain and the European Union are exploring a new partnership focused on security, trade, and youth mobility, marking a potential shift in relations post-Brexit. The proposed security pact aims to enhance cooperation on defense, economic security, and transnational crime, while a 'veterinary' deal seeks to reduce border checks on food and drink. A youth mobility deal, allowing under-30s to live and work in each other's countries, is also under consideration, though with potential limitations on numbers and visa requirements. This initiative is viewed by some as a pragmatic step forward, while others fear it could undermine the UK's sovereignty and diverge from the original goals of Brexit. Optimism surrounds potential economic benefits and strengthened security ties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, Cassie Ventura faced intense cross-examination regarding her allegations of sexual assault and coercion, with defense attorneys presenting archived text messages to challenge her claims. The defense sought to portray Ventura as a willing participant in Combs' lifestyle, highlighting messages that showed apparent enthusiasm for their sexual activities, including 'freak-offs.' Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs and her initial desire to please him, but maintained that his behavior became increasingly violent and controlling over time. The defense also suggested that jealousy and infidelity were mutual issues in their relationship. The trial continues with concerns about Ventura's pregnancy.</p>

Customers are encouraged to use store-provided hand baskets instead, and the owners are offering assistance to shoppers struggling to afford groceries.

While there is growing political agreement that debanking is a problem, there is less consensus on how to address it, with some arguing it infringes on free-market principles and others viewing it as a bank's right to manage risk. The Trump administration has signaled it will cease enforcing a bank regulatory tool related to reputational risk, and lawmakers are considering measures to ensure fair access to banking services.

          <p>Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, has announced that it will be raising prices due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs, signaling a direct effect on U.S. consumers. The price increases will affect goods including vegetables and furniture, with more significant increases expected as back-to-school shopping begins in July. While Walmart will attempt to absorb some of the tariff costs, the magnitude of the tariffs makes it impossible to avoid raising prices for consumers. Other retailers, including Mattel and Procter & Gamble, have also announced price increases related to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's request to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship. The case raises questions about the legality of limiting U.S. citizenship and the power of individual judges to block presidential policies nationwide. Justices expressed concerns about the potential for unlawful executive orders to remain in place for extended periods and the impact on individual rights. The court's decision, expected by summer, could have significant implications for immigration policy and the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.</p>
