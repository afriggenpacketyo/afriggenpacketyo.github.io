          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its Extra Value Meals, offering a 15% discount on combo meals, to attract price-conscious customers. This move comes as fast-food chains face shrinking traffic, particularly from low-income consumers. The expanded value menu, featuring eight different combo options, is part of a broader strategy to re-engage these frequent visitors. The company plans further deals later in the year to sustain this focus on affordability.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing costs reached a 27-year high, with 30-year bond yields jumping to 5.698%, as concerns about public finances grow.

Mary famously defied medical advice to "pull the plug" during his recovery, highlighting her unwavering support.

          <p>Manhattan office leasing surged over 20% in August, reaching 3.7 million square feet, well above the 10-year monthly average. This robust activity suggests the yearly volume could exceed 40 million square feet for the first time since 2019, driven by a return to office, low unemployment, and a re-emergence of key industries like tech and legal. The "flight to quality" has tightened availability in newer buildings, while overall availability fell to its lowest since January 2021. Average asking rents also increased by 1% from July, though they remain 6% lower than March 2020 levels.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of India, labeling the trade relationship a "totally one sided disaster" after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China. Trump accused India of imposing high tariffs on U.S. exports while buying oil and arms from Russia, despite India's reported offer to cut tariffs. This comes amid souring U.S.-India relations, with the U.S. having imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods for purchasing Russian oil. India's foreign ministry has countered by pointing out U.S. and EU trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields surged after a federal appeals court ruled most of the Trump administration's global tariffs illegal, raising the possibility of the government having to refund collected money.

This ruling, which Trump plans to appeal, could strain the U.S. fiscal situation, as tariffs were projected to bring in substantial revenue.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This extensive article analyzes Iran's "Axis of Resistance," a network of proxy militias, and its strategic evolution and recent setbacks. It details how Iran, learning from the Iran-Iraq War, cultivated groups like Hezbollah and Iraqi militias to project power and undermine adversaries, often at minimal direct cost. The article argues that while the Axis dictated regional geopolitics for two decades, its recent "shambles" due to Israeli and U.S. actions, and internal decay in places like Lebanon and Iraq, suggest a significant shift. Despite these defeats, Iran's commitment to resisting the U.S. and Israel remains a core identity.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic argues that President Donald Trump is exploiting "fake emergencies" to accumulate real power, citing his actions in D.C., immigration crackdowns, and tariff wars. It contends that traditional checks on presidential emergency authority—presidential character, congressional oversight, and judicial review—are failing under his administration. The piece highlights instances where Trump's emergency declarations, such as a "crime emergency" in D.C. or an "invasion" at the border, are seen as lacking factual basis, raising concerns about the erosion of democratic guardrails.</p>

          <p>Scientists are discovering a vast, largely unknown biodiversity, estimating that 90% of Earth's species remain undescribed, particularly small organisms called "dark taxa." These creatures, crucial for ecosystem function, are now being identified at an unprecedented rate thanks to advancements in DNA sequencing, or "barcoding." Researchers are finding hundreds of new species wherever they look, highlighting that we are in a "Golden Age of species discovery." This effort is considered vital for understanding ecosystems, detecting threats, and completing a comprehensive inventory of life on Earth, potentially by 2040.</p>

          <p>British pubs, a cornerstone of UK culture, are facing significant closures, with an estimated 378 pubs expected to shut down in 2025, resulting in over 5,600 job losses. This decline is driven by a combination of reduced consumer spending and escalating operational costs, including increases in minimum wage, National Insurance, and business rates. Pub managers report having to pass these costs onto consumers, pushing the average pint price above £5. The industry warns of significant economic knock-on effects and urges urgent government action, such as cuts to business rates and VAT, to prevent further decline. (not investment advice)</p>
