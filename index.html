            <h2>ASML Cites Tariff Uncertainty After Bookings Fall Short of Expectations</h2>

            <p>ASML, a key semiconductor equipment manufacturer, reported lower-than-expected net bookings for the first quarter of 2025, raising concerns about a potential slowdown in demand. CEO Christophe Fouquet noted that while the demand outlook remains strong due to AI, tariffs are creating new uncertainties on a macroeconomic level and potentially impacting market demands. The company maintains its 2025 revenue guidance between 30 billion and 35 billion euros, but acknowledges potential impacts from global chip stock fragility amid worries about President Trump's tariff plans. The U.S. Commerce Department is also conducting a national security investigation into semiconductor imports, potentially leading to additional trade measures. (not investment advice)</p>

This flurry of IPO applications, with sixteen companies submitting in the past two weeks, suggests that Hong Kong remains an attractive IPO venue despite US-China trade war volatility.

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court is set to rule on a legal challenge concerning the definition of a woman under equality laws, specifically whether a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate can be legally considered a woman. The case stems from a 2018 Scottish law mandating 50% female representation on public boards, which included transgender women in its definition of women. For Women Scotland (FWS) is challenging this definition, arguing that 'sex' should refer to biological sex, while opponents like Amnesty International argue that excluding transgender people conflicts with human rights.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) issued a cease and desist order against Google for violating anti-monopoly laws by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services. The JFTC stated that Google used licensing agreements to mandate the preinstallation and prominent featuring of Google Search and Chrome on devices. The commission also found that Google required manufacturers to exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model, impacting competition in the search market.</p>

            <p>The White House has announced a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump for wire services like the Associated Press (AP), following a court ruling that the White House improperly punished the AP for its coverage. The new policy limits the number of wire service reporters in pool coverage situations and grants the press secretary greater discretion over who can question the president. This move has been criticized by the AP and the White House Correspondents' Association, who argue it undermines press freedom and allows for viewpoint discrimination.</p>
