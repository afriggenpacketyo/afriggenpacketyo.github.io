          <p>China is expanding duty-free access for taxable products to 53 African countries, a move that contrasts sharply with recent US policies. The United States is reportedly planning to levy higher tariffs on some African nations and has imposed aid cuts and visa restrictions. This policy divergence is strengthening the narrative that Beijing is a more reliable and beneficial partner for African nations. Analysts suggest Washington's long-held belief that humanitarian aid would secure unwavering goodwill is proving to be outdated, as China's economic diplomacy gains significant traction across the continent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a large-scale recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The effort was initiated by citizens angry over the KMT-led legislative bloc's actions, which include blocking key budgets and passing controversial reforms perceived as favoring mainland China. The outcome could potentially shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority. The KMT has condemned the recalls as political retaliation, while China has accused the ruling party of suppressing opposition. The situation has intensified political tensions on the self-ruled island.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that dopamine agonist drugs, such as Ropinirole prescribed for Parkinson's disease, can cause severe side effects including compulsive gambling and extreme, sometimes dangerous, sexual behaviors. The article details cases where patients developed obsessive sexual urges, leading to family breakdowns and even criminal acts like sexual assault. Despite links being identified by drug manufacturers years ago, warnings on patient leaflets remain vague, and some doctors are reportedly still not adequately informing patients of these devastating risks. The report highlights dozens of families torn apart by these medication-induced behavioral changes, prompting calls for stronger safety warnings.</p>

          <p>A labor strike involving employees of Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, has left trash piling up in numerous American cities for over three weeks. The Teamsters union, representing the workers, is demanding better pay and benefits, citing the high cost of living. The dispute, which started in the Boston area, has spread to cities in California, Illinois, Georgia, and Washington, impacting millions of residents. While some local disputes have been resolved, many workers remain on strike, leading to foul odors, pest problems, and legal action from municipalities against the company for breach of contract.</p>

The incident represents the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, and an investigation by the ATF is underway to determine the full circumstances and implement new safety protocols to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>A Leicester salon owner is preparing for a pivotal hearing in her long-running trademark battle with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of a salon named 'nkd,' has been fighting L'Oréal's opposition to her trademark renewal since 2022. The French firm, which owns the 'Naked' makeup line by Urban Decay, argues that the 'nkd' trademark would cause consumer confusion. After spending over £30,000 in legal fees and facing significant delays, Dowdeswell says she feels ready to fight again as a hearing date with the UK's Intellectual Property Office has finally been set for later this year.</p>

          <p>A media investigation has found that at least 245 soldiers aged 18 have been killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine over the past two years, despite official promises to the contrary. Changes in Russian law now allow teenagers to sign professional army contracts immediately after finishing school, bypassing traditional conscription service. Attracted by large cash bonuses and patriotic propaganda in schools, these young men are enlisting voluntarily. The article highlights the tragic stories of several teenagers who were killed within weeks of their 18th birthdays, underscoring the human cost of the war for Russia's youngest recruits.</p>

          <h2>Warm, Sunny Weather in UK Leads to Boom for Some Insect Species</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 20:53:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm conditions caused a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. This contrasts sharply with the previous year's 'butterfly emergency' caused by cool, wet weather. However, the relative lack of rain this year is a cause for concern, as it could dry up vital wetland habitats and potentially lead to lower insect and amphibian numbers in the following year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, had alleged that local laws limiting cooperation between police and federal immigration agents were unlawfully thwarting federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, the judge determined that the local policies are protected by the Tenth Amendment and do not illegally interfere with federal operations. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, stating that it affirms the legality of the city's welcoming ordinance and protects public safety.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the infamous Hollywood blacklist era of the 1940s and 50s. The exhibit focuses on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry, which led to the blacklisting of numerous writers, directors, and actors. It highlights the story of the "Hollywood Ten," who were imprisoned for refusing to testify, and details how many in the industry felt compelled to name names to save their own careers. The exhibit uses personal artifacts, like letters and drawings, to illustrate the profound personal and professional impact of the Red Scare on Hollywood and beyond.</p>

          <p>A Southern California man has been arrested and charged with wire fraud for allegedly conning multiple people he met on dating apps out of more than $2 million. Prosecutors claim the 39-year-old man used apps like Tinder and Bumble to find victims, whom he deceived by fabricating a successful career as a financial manager and investment expert. He allegedly convinced his matches to give him money for fake investment opportunities, providing them with fraudulent contracts and schedules of returns. The suspect then allegedly used the victims' money for personal expenses, including a down payment on a luxury car.</p>

It also touches on the business side of his golf empire and his long-standing desire for his prestigious Turnberry course in Scotland to host a major championship, blending sport with personal and political ambition.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity before her two-day interview with the Department of Justice. This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche without fear that her statements could be used against her in a future prosecution. This type of immunity is commonly used when prosecutors are seeking cooperation from an individual. The development comes as Maxwell appeals her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, and her lawyer stated that while they have not asked for anything in return, she would welcome any relief from her sentence.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's desert bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. Last fall, a team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only remaining disease-free herd. These animals, including pregnant ewes, were airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, protected colony. A recent check on the relocated herd brought promising news, as biologists observed a group that included several newborn lambs, signaling a hopeful start for the species' recovery in the region.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with President Trump's special envoy stating that the U.S. team is returning home for consultations. The envoy blamed Hamas, saying its response to proposals "shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire" and that the group was not acting in good faith. The breakdown in talks comes as the United Nations warns of a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with children starving to death and a severe lack of aid entering the territory. Hamas officials expressed surprise at the U.S. statement, insisting they have behaved responsibly to end the conflict.</p>
