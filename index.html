          <h2>German Military Survey Finds No Systemic Extremism But Reveals Problematic Attitudes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that the German military does not have 'systemic' extremism within its ranks, with only 0.4% of soldiers showing right-wing extremist attitudes. However, the report also found that 6.4% of soldiers hold 'consistent chauvinist attitudes,' and 3.5% have 'consistent xenophobic attitudes.' While the survey authors suggest the German military has stronger anti-extremism measures than most, some researchers are skeptical, noting the survey's voluntary nature and the potential influence of heightened political scrutiny on right-wing extremism within the Bundeswehr. The study interviewed over 4,300 military personnel and conducted small group discussions at eight different military bases across Germany to come to its conclusion.</p>

          <p>Five Texas district attorneys have filed lawsuits against Attorney General Ken Paxton, challenging a new rule that allows his office broad access to their case records. The district attorneys argue that the rule is an unconstitutional overreach that violates the separation of powers and imposes unnecessary burdens on county prosecutors. Paxton's office claims the rule is a way to 'rein in rogue district attorneys' who allegedly refuse to uphold the law, while district attorneys argue the rule will divert resources and staff away from core prosecutorial roles and responsibilities, harming public safety and the administration of justice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, Casey Michel argues that the Trump family's inventive ways to profit from the patriarch's return to office are not unprecedented, but rather a continuation of a long history of politicians exploiting their positions for personal gain. Michel points to examples like the Clinton Foundation and Hunter Biden's dealings, suggesting a systemic issue in American politics. The Trump family's actions, such as peddling access to the administration and securing deals with foreign entities, would have been considered scandals under previous administrations, yet they face little consequence. The article urges Congress to pass legislation preventing former politicians from serving as foreign lobbyists and barring family members of administration officials from engaging in foreign deals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards, in this New York Times article, contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. Fueled by 'flygskam' (flight shame), Europe is expanding its night train network to compete with short-haul flights in terms of speed, cost, comfort, and environmental impact. Meanwhile, America continues to prioritize cars and underfund public infrastructure, leading to increased congestion and a decline in driver satisfaction. The article argues for greater investment in rail networks and subway systems in the US, drawing lessons from China's successful high-speed rail system.</p>

Despite the updated estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business, and the consensus price target remains largely unchanged at €12.30. However, analysts forecast that thyssenkrupp nucera KGaA's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In 1993, the murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis yielded a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints. The investigation spanned decades, with investigators comparing the prints to multiple suspects. Years later, DNA evidence led them to Jerry Westrom, a married businessman with no history of violent crime, though he had been arrested for soliciting sex workers. Westrom denied knowing Childs, but his DNA was found at the scene. The footprints became crucial, with experts disagreeing on their interpretation, leading to Westrom's conviction, though questions about other DNA found at the scene remain.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing.

During Kenyan President William Ruto’s visit to China, he sought Chinese funding for the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) extension, with Chinese contractors expected to operate the railway for at least 25 years to recoup their investment.</p>

The plan would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19, although children and those already enrolled would not be affected. Adults with 'unsatisfactory' immigration status would be charged $100 per month starting in 2027. These measures are projected to save California $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year, with Medi-Cal's general fund spending expected to increase to $44.6 billion in 2025-26.</p>

          <p>The 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis was marked by a grisly scene and a pivotal clue: bloody, bare footprints. Investigators meticulously documented the scene, leading to a decades-long investigation. The case took a turn in 2015 when DNA evidence pointed to Jerry Westrom, a local businessman. Westrom denied involvement, but his DNA and the footprints tied him to the crime scene. Despite a complex case with multiple DNA profiles, Westrom was eventually convicted, bringing closure to Childs' family after years of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Germany is planning a historic shift in security policy, aiming to become the 'strongest conventional army in Europe' with a potential defense expenditure increase to 5% of GDP. Other EU countries like France, Poland, and the UK are also bulking up their militaries, focusing on modernization and technological advancements. While these efforts aim to deter threats and enhance security, they are unlikely to significantly alter the global ranking of military strength in the medium term.

Key components of the bill to fund President Donald Trump's agenda looks to provide major tax breaks by cutting spending elsewhere, including massive cuts to Medicaid.

While some Republicans insist the cuts target fraud, waste and abuse, some Americans fear reduced access to healthcare and difficult choices between coverage and basic needs.
