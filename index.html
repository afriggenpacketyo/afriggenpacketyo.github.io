          <p>Israel confirmed conducting a second airstrike this week on Houthi targets in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, attributing the actions to the Iran-backed group's threats against Israel and its allies. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the Houthis are undermining regional stability and global navigation freedom. This latest strike occurred during a Houthi leader's speech, following a previous attack in response to Houthi missile fire that reportedly killed six and wounded 86 people. The ongoing conflict, nearly two years old, began after Hamas's October 7 massacre, with Houthis consistently launching missiles in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Mexican senators engaged in a physical altercation following a heated debate concerning alleged opposition calls for US military intervention against drug cartels, a claim denied by the PRI and PAN parties. Lawmaker Alejandro Moreno confronted Senate president Gerardo Fernandez Norona, leading to shoves and a slap. The incident highlights deep divisions over national security and sovereignty, especially with President Trump's administration previously directing the Pentagon to use military force against cartels designated as terrorist organizations. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated the country would not accept such intervention.</p>

          <p>Authorities identified Robin Westman, 23, as the suspect in the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that killed two children and injured 17 others, before the shooter died by suicide. Westman, who previously attended the school and whose mother worked at the church, is believed to have acted alone, firing through church windows with legally purchased weapons. Investigators are examining a manifesto and YouTube videos that reveal a 'deranged obsession with previous mass shooters' and a nihilistic outlook, though a specific motive for targeting the church remains under investigation. Officials urge against using the tragedy to villainize any community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from the board. Cook's unprecedented lawsuit challenges Trump's justification, alleging mortgage fraud, as 'nakedly pretextual' and insufficient 'cause' under the Federal Reserve Act. Her attorney argues the allegations are false and, even if true, occurred before her Senate confirmation, not constituting grounds for removal. The case, which names Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the board as defendants, is expected to reach the Supreme Court and raises concerns about the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) reported a 13% increase in human trafficking investigations in 2024, reaching a record 576 cases, with sexual exploitation accounting for the largest share at 364 cases. Authorities note a concerning rise in exploitation occurring in private homes, making detection difficult and suggesting the actual numbers are much higher. Minors are particularly vulnerable, often lured online using the 'lover-boy method,' with the BKA criticizing online platforms for insufficient protective mechanisms. The report also highlights a record number of labor exploitation cases, primarily affecting individuals from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled the first electric vehicle (EV) models qualifying for a new £3,750 discount under its grant scheme, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are among the initial models to receive the maximum discount, with 26 other models eligible for £1,500 off, for new cars costing up to £37,000. This initiative, part of a £650 million, three-year scheme, seeks to make EVs more affordable, addressing a key barrier for many drivers. The government aims to ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030, while also promoting sustainable manufacturing practices for higher discounts.</p>

          <h2>Future Flood Predictions Clouded by NOAA Budget Cuts Amid Rising Extreme Weather</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 12:10:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of flood prediction in the U.S. is becoming uncertain due to proposed Trump administration budget cuts and staffing reductions at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This comes as the country experiences an active flood season, with several deadly events, and climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation. Experts warn that hobbling NOAA would limit the nation's ability to forecast and prepare for these events, impacting critical infrastructure planning and community safety. Projects like Atlas 15 and modernized precipitation models face funding challenges, hindering efforts to update crucial data for civil engineers and city planners.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is in turmoil after Director Susan Monarez was fired and four senior leaders resigned in protest against Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. This follows months of tension, including layoffs, controversial vaccine policy rollbacks, and a shooting at a CDC office. The FDA's recent limited approval of new Covid vaccines, excluding healthy adults and children, reportedly led to Monarez's refusal to commit to the narrower policy. Critics argue Kennedy's agenda is anti-science and a 'national security risk,' undermining public trust and potentially leading to negative health outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article re-evaluates the concept of diversity in business, arguing that while traditional DEI programs focusing on innate attributes like race and gender have faced criticism, cognitive and ideological diversity are crucial for organizational success. Research suggests that teams with diverse experiences, skills, and opinions, particularly those combining different creative and ideological viewpoints, are more effective and innovative. The author provides three pointers for companies to pursue truly profitable diversity: moving beyond demographic proxies, prioritizing candidates with high openness to new ideas, and embracing political diversity to guard against groupthink. Cultivating curiosity about differing beliefs is presented as a key to achieving this.</p>

This 'unprecedented ban' stems from a disagreement over a story regarding local government reorganization, with Barton accusing the publication of 'misinformation.' The council will cease sending press releases and deny interviews, though reporters can still attend public meetings. Critics, including senior editor Natalie Fahy and various MPs, condemned the move as a direct attack on press freedom and accountability, drawing comparisons to Donald Trump's tactics.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have formally triggered a 'snapback mechanism' to restore major UN sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's 'clear and deliberate' non-compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal commitments. This move, which could reimpose sanctions within 30 days, comes amidst escalating tensions and Iran's increased nuclear activities since the US unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018. Iran's foreign ministry condemned the action as a 'provocative and unnecessary escalation,' vowing an 'appropriate response' and warning it could undermine ongoing processes with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
