          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have reached an agreement to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. While leaders from both countries hailed the agreement as significant, analysts suggest it does not substantially alter the terms of trade between the two nations. The US has agreed to reduce the import tax on 100,000 cars a year to 10%, while tariffs on steel and aluminum have also been slashed, and there's an agreement for reciprocal access for beef exports. The deal is seen as a potential win for US ranchers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering releasing the audio of former President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur, despite having already released the transcript. Sources indicate that Trump's White House lawyers were provided the audiotape weeks ago. The release would occur as the Trump administration is working to keep special counsel Jack Smith's report on Trump's handling of classified documents private. The Hur report described Biden as an elderly man with a poor memory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering releasing the audio recording of former President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden's handling of classified documents. The transcript of the interview was previously released, so the audio would not reveal new information but would allow the public to hear Biden's voice. This potential release coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to keep former special counsel Jack Smith's report on Trump's handling of classified documents confidential.</p>
