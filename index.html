          <p>North Korea conducted a ballistic missile launch eastward, as confirmed by South Korea's military, marking the first such event since President Lee Jae-myung assumed office in June. The unidentified missile was reportedly fired towards the sea off North Korea's east coast. This action follows a series of previous missile tests overseen by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un since his high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with US President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019. President Lee, during his campaign and first UN address, proactively brought up the necessity of halting hostile moves and ushering in "a new era of peaceful coexistence," reiterating the need for denuclearization while fostering inter-Korean cooperation. This recent launch signals ongoing regional tensions and Pyongyang's continued weapons development, despite diplomatic overtures.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 21:05:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports increased by 4.2% year-on-year in September, ending a four-month decline, driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, particularly mainland China, though overall figures missed Reuters' estimates. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to drop by 13.3%, despite a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs, with auto shipments taking a significant hit. Semiconductor exports were a significant driver of overall growth. The data coincides with Sanae Takaichi taking office as Japan's first female prime minister, whose economic policies, including loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, are anticipated to weaken the yen, making Japanese goods more competitive and benefiting the nation's key exporters.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy critically described the ongoing government shutdown as a "'Seinfeld' shutdown" because he believes it's "about nothing," blaming Democrats for declining to pass a "clean" continuing resolution. He drew a contrast with the 2013 shutdown, noting a reversal of roles where Republicans now push for a clean bill while Democrats demand extensions for expiring health insurance subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid restrictions. McCarthy suggested Democrats are struggling to find a clear message and are "fearful" of their party's rank-and-file members. He also argued that the current political division makes it harder to assign blame, unlike previous funding fights.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew from his scheduled Senate hearing after allegations surfaced that he sent offensive text messages, including one where he reportedly conceded having "a Nazi streak." Politico published these incendiary texts, which also purportedly called Martin Luther King Jr. "the 1960s George Floyd," leading to bipartisan blowback and multiple Republican senators withdrawing their support. Ingrassia's lawyer denied the authenticity of the messages, suggesting they were self-deprecating and satirical humor, while also citing the risk of AI manipulation. The nomination's future remains unclear, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicating Ingrassia would not be confirmed.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, alongside Jared Kushner and US special envoy Steve Witkoff, expressed unexpected optimism regarding the progress of the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire, despite recent violence. They are currently in Israel to reinforce the fragile agreement, which has facilitated the release of all 20 living Israeli hostages and the confirmed remains of 13 deceased captives, along with the return of 165 Palestinian bodies to Gaza. Vance acknowledged the "difficulties" in securing all remains, urging patience due to bodies buried under rubble. However, former Israeli official Alon Pinkas voiced skepticism, suggesting Prime Minister Netanyahu was pressured into the deal and may resume offensive operations in Gaza once the US delegation departs.</p>

          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, clarifying that cold water doesn't enhance shine and no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which require a haircut. They emphasize that products merely offer temporary cosmetic fixes and warn against overspending on false promises. The experts also stress that hair does not "self-clean," highlighting the necessity of regular washing for scalp health, as infrequent cleaning allows oil, dirt, yeast, and bacteria to build up, worsening conditions like dandruff and causing odor. They recommend washing every other day for oily hair or frequent product users.</p>

The plant is identified as a critical component of Russia's military-industrial complex, responsible for producing gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel components used in ammunition and missiles against Ukraine. This action comes despite Kremlin warnings against providing Ukraine with long-range weapons, which Kyiv deems imperative for targeting Russia's war infrastructure.

          <p>Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in the wrongful death trial of his late teammate Tyler Skaggs, stating he never witnessed signs of drug use from Skaggs before his overdose in 2019. Trout acknowledged seeing former communications director Eric Kay acting "wired" and suspected drug use, but was unaware Kay allegedly supplied opioids to players. The lawsuit, filed by Skaggs' family, contends the Angels are responsible for allowing Kay, who was convicted of providing the fentanyl-laced pill, access to players. The trial highlights the pressures athletes face and MLB's subsequent policy changes on opioid testing for players, aiming to address substance abuse within the league.</p>

          <p>An analysis examines President Trump's contrasting diplomatic outcomes in Gaza and Ukraine, noting his success in brokering a ceasefire and hostage release in the Middle East versus the indefinite suspension of a planned summit with Vladimir Putin. The article suggests Trump's leverage in Gaza stemmed from Israel's attack on Hamas negotiators and his strong standing with Israelis, giving him unique influence over Netanyahu. In contrast, Trump's fluctuating approach to the Ukraine war, oscillating between pressuring Putin and Zelensky, has yielded little progress, highlighting the difficulty of finding peace when neither side is willing to concede.

          <p>An article delves into the reasons behind soaring supermarket prices in the UK, using the dramatic 134% price increase of orange juice since 2020 as a prime example. Factors contributing to this inflation include crop diseases, extreme weather, over-reliance on single-nation supply, new packaging regulations, and international trade tensions like US tariffs. While global orange harvests are recovering, the concentrated market control by a few large producers suggests prices may remain stubbornly high. The analysis suggests that consumers were initially shielded from the worst increases, and now a "payback time" for retailers might be contributing to current high costs.</p>

          <p>Following the audacious robbery of royal crown jewels from Paris' iconic Louvre museum, criminologist Alain Bauer predicts authorities will apprehend the thieves, citing abundant DNA evidence left at the scene, including on a discarded crown. However, Bauer believes the priceless jewels, valued at an estimated €88 million ($102 million), are unlikely to be recovered, as they could be broken up and sold on the black market. The heist, the most spectacular at the Louvre since the Mona Lisa theft in 1911, exposed significant security vulnerabilities, with a recent audit noting 35% of the rooms in the Denon Wing, where the jewels were kept, lacked security cameras.</p>

          <p>France's Ministry of Culture confirmed that the royal crown jewels stolen from the Louvre museum were not privately insured, as French law prohibits state museums from insuring their property unless it's on loan.

Experts noted that the state itself bears responsibility for its national collections. While authorities are pursuing the suspects, the lack of insurance adds a unique financial dimension to the national embarrassment and the likely permanent loss of these historical treasures, emphasizing the state's direct financial burden.</p>

          <p>Six individuals were arrested in Dublin after a violent protest erupted outside the Citywest Hotel, used to house asylum seekers, where Irish police were attacked with bricks, fireworks, and glass bottles. A police vehicle was set on fire, and protesters attempted to breach a police cordon using horse-drawn sulkies and garden tools, damaging walls for missiles. Gardaí deployed riot police, a water cannon, and mounted units to manage the crowd, with one officer receiving medical attention. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin and Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan condemned the "thuggery" and attacks on officers, emphasizing that such violence does not reflect the local community.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lauded Viktor Gyokeres' overall impact on the team after the £64m striker ended a seven-game goal drought with two goals in a 4-0 Champions League win over Atletico Madrid. Despite earlier frustrations, Gyokeres' persistence and physical contribution have made Arsenal "much more unpredictable," according to Arteta, opening spaces for other players. His teammates showed strong support, pushing him to receive crowd adulation after his goals, demonstrating squad togetherness. This performance, bringing his tally to five goals in 12 matches, is hoped to mark the beginning of a prolific scoring spell for the 27-year-old, significantly enhancing the team's attacking prowess.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Attorney General, Kris Mayes, is suing House Speaker Mike Johnson to compel the swearing-in of Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a special congressional election in September. Grijalva's swearing-in is being delayed, reportedly by Johnson, who cites the ongoing government shutdown as the reason. Mayes argues this action disenfranchises Arizona voters and constitutes "taxation without representation," vowing not to allow Arizonans to be silenced. Grijalva believes the delay is linked to her intention to sign a discharge petition, which currently has 217 signatures, to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, where her 218th signature could be decisive in achieving justice for survivors.</p>

          <p>La Liga announced the cancellation of the Villarreal-Barcelona match scheduled for Miami this December, citing "uncertainty" and critical responses within Spain. The decision, made with promoter Relevent, was deeply regretted by La Liga, which views staging matches abroad as crucial for global growth and competitiveness against leagues like the Premier League. The move faced strong opposition, including player protests over a perceived "lack of transparency," and complaints from Real Madrid, whose manager Xabi Alonso argued it "distorts the competition." Villarreal's manager Marcelino criticized the timing of the announcement, calling it a lack of respect.</p>

          <p>An article critically examines President Trump's demand for $230 million in compensation from the Justice Department for past investigations, highlighting significant ethical concerns. The payment, sought through administrative claims related to probes into his 2016 campaign and the Mar-a-Lago search, would require approval from DOJ officials, potentially including his former personal lawyer. Critics describe the situation as "shockingly, cartoonishly unethical," noting that unlike lawsuits, there are no court guardrails to prevent the payment, which may not even be publicly disclosed. This raises questions about conflicts of interest and the integrity of the justice system, prompting calls for greater transparency.</p>

          <p>Recent widespread internet outages, caused by a technical issue at Amazon Web Services' Northern Virginia facilities, underscore the fragility of the modern web and its heavy reliance on a few massive companies. This incident, marking at least the third such disruption in five years, affected over 1,000 sites and services globally, costing companies hundreds of billions. The article explains that while cloud computing offers accessibility, it consolidates points of failure under giants like Amazon, which controls an estimated 30% of the global market. This centralization means a single company's issues can disrupt essential services worldwide, raising concerns about corporate influence and the lack of truly decentralized alternatives.</p>

          <p>Construction has begun on President Donald Trump's new $250 million White House ballroom, but the identities of many wealthy donors funding the project remain a mystery, raising ethical concerns. Trump stated he would personally contribute and that anonymous donors would also provide significant funds, including YouTube contributing $22 million as part of a lawsuit settlement. Ethics experts, like former White House lawyer Richard Painter, view the project as a "pay-to-play scheme" that uses White House access to raise money from corporations seeking government favors. While the White House insists the renovation won't cost taxpayers and will benefit future administrations, the scale of the facility creates temptation for political fundraising.</p>

European leaders and Zelensky supported a ceasefire along current lines as a starting point, accusing Russia of stalling.

Experts, including Ryan Hass from the National Security Council, describe Xi as "cold-blooded in their calculations of national or personal interest" and not easily swayed by charm. Trump's long-touted approach, which often dismisses extensive preparation and groundwork, is seen by some as a strategy to put opponents on the defensive. However, its potential success against a pragmatic and emotionally detached leader like Xi is widely doubted by seasoned observers.</p>

          <p>Netflix shares fell approximately 7% after the company missed its third-quarter earnings estimates, attributing the shortfall to an ongoing tax dispute with Brazilian authorities. A 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country was not factored into previous forecasts, and Netflix decided to charge its impact to the third quarter. Despite the earnings miss, revenue rose 17% year-over-year, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and its best-ever ad sales quarter. The company expects continued revenue growth for the fourth quarter, with a strong content slate planned. (not investment advice)</p>
