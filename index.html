          <p>Will Hutchins, known for his role as Tom Brewster in the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94 due to respiratory failure. The New York Times article details how Hutchins' character was a comically genteel sheriff who preferred cherry soda to whiskey, a stark contrast to typical western protagonists. After "Sugarfoot," Hutchins continued acting in television and film, including appearances in Elvis Presley movies and a role in "The Shooting" alongside Jack Nicholson. Later in life, he worked as a traveling clown, finding fulfillment in bringing laughter to audiences around the world.</p>

          <p>After more than a week, the oil leak from an unused well off the Louisiana coast has been contained, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. The leak, which began on April 26, 2025, had been spewing oil and natural gas, contaminating marshland and protected Gulf Coast habitats. Cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing, involving multiple agencies and private contractors. The incident highlights the challenge of orphaned and aging oil wells, with Louisiana having thousands still uncapped despite receiving funds to plug some of them.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry. The BBC article reports Trump's claim that other countries' incentives to attract filmmakers pose a "National Security threat." This move could significantly impact American production companies filming abroad, with several recent major movies having been shot outside the United States. The announcement comes amid escalating trade disputes, with China already reducing its quota of American films allowed into the country.</p>

          <p>The end of a U.S. tax loophole is forcing apparel makers in Guangzhou, China, to consider alternative markets or cheaper locations. The New York Times article details how tariffs and a new tax on cheap imports have cut into businesses already dealing with tight profit margins. Factories are struggling to compete on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu, which previously allowed them to reach U.S. shoppers with tax-free packages. Many factory owners are considering relocating to provinces with lower wages or countries like Vietnam to avoid tariffs.</p>

VOA, a federally funded international broadcasting network, has had its operations suspended, with staff placed on administrative leave.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory on the NIH campus, following scrutiny over alleged animal abuse. Fox News reports that the lab was accused of conducting deadly experiments on beagles for over 40 years. The White Coat Waste (WCW) project detailed the lab's history of pumping pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and bleeding them out. Animal rights groups and lawmakers have praised the closure, calling it a victory for ethical treatment of animals.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies "produced" outside the United States, claiming it poses a national security threat. The New York Times article notes that the exact scope of the proposed tariff is unclear. Hollywood has increasingly turned to foreign locales for filming due to tax incentives and lower labor costs. The potential tariff has sparked debate about its impact on the film industry and its workers.</p>
