            <p>Fyre Festival 2, organized by Billy McFarland, has been postponed with refunds issued to ticket holders. The event, scheduled for May 30 to June 2 in Mexico, was promoted with tickets starting at $1,400. McFarland, convicted of wire fraud for the original 2017 Fyre Festival, expressed confidence in the new event despite skepticism. Mexican officials had previously stated that no event of that name was authorized, though McFarland claimed to have the necessary permits. The postponement raises questions about the viability and organization of the revived festival.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that tariffs could create a "challenging scenario" of rising inflation and slowing economic growth.

Powell indicated the Fed can remain patient to assess the impact of tariffs before adjusting interest rates.

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the Trump administration return Kilmar Ábrego García, mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison. The deportation was an "administrative error," but officials claim Ábrego García has ties to MS-13, which his family denies. El Salvador's President Bukele refuses to return him. The Supreme Court ordered the administration to "facilitate" his return. Ábrego García had legal protection from deportation due to potential persecution in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>A federal judge found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for ignoring his order barring the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. Judge Boasberg cited a "willful disregard" for the court's order. The administration has one week to submit a declaration explaining its plan to "purge" the contempt finding. The White House plans to seek "immediate appellate relief." The ACLU has emphasized the need to return the individuals sent to the Salvadoran prison.</p>

            <p>Analysts warn that Trump's tariffs have created a volatile market, making it difficult for investors to anticipate future decisions and their impact. The policy shifts have left markets baffled, with uncertainty looming over Wall Street. Fed Chair Jerome Powell expects tariffs to increase inflation and slow economic growth. Despite the market turmoil, the economy remains solid by some measures, but consumer sentiment has dropped significantly.

            <p>A US judge has said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt of court for "wilful disregard" of an order to halt deportation flights to El Salvador. The administration had invoked a 227-year-old law meant to protect the US during wartime to carry out the mass deportation. The White House said it would contest the decision. Judge Boasberg's decision to begin contempt proceedings escalates a clash between the White House and the judiciary over the president's powers.</p>
