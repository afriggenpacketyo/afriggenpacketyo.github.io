          <p>Kerri Pegg, a 42-year-old prison governor, has been sentenced to nine years in jail for engaging in a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, a drug-dealing gang leader and inmate at HMP Kirkham. Pegg, considered a rising star in the Prison Service, abused her position by helping Saunderson secure day release and accepting gifts funded by the proceeds of his criminal activities, including a Â£12,000 Mercedes. The judge condemned her actions as a betrayal of public trust and noted her vulnerability to corruption due to undeclared debts.
