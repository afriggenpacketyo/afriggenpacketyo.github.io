          <p>President Trump fired Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for DEI initiatives as inappropriate for her position. Sajet, appointed by former President Obama in 2013, has been criticized by Trump for the Smithsonian's perceived leftist and anti-American bias. This move follows an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian programs deemed to promote divisive ideologies and the removal of leadership at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. Trump has tasked Vice President JD Vance with overseeing efforts to eliminate "improper ideology" from the institution. Optimism around cultural institutions is diminishing given the aggressive political moves.</p>

Discussions include tariff implementation, treatment of UK-assembled cars, and pharmaceutical products.

          <p>Ukraine's president has questioned Russia's commitment to progressing peace talks after Moscow confirmed it was sending a team to talks in Istanbul on Monday. Russia has yet to send its negotiating proposals to Ukraine, a key demand by Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of "doing everything it can to ensure the next possible meeting is fruitless". As the talks approached, both Russia and Ukraine reported explosions on Friday night and in the early hours Saturday morning, injuring at least seven people in Russia's Kursk region and one person in the cities of Kharkiv and Izyum in Ukraine.</p>
