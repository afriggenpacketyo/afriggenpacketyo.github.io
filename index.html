          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated he may block a deal for the Washington Commanders' new stadium if the team does not revert to its original "Redskins" name. In a social media post, Trump claimed the former name would make the team more valuable and that he would not approve a stadium deal in Washington D.C. otherwise. The NFL team changed its name in 2020 after years of criticism from Native American groups and activists who considered it a racist slur. This intervention adds a significant political layer to the ongoing debate surrounding the team's branding and identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the three primary requirements for individuals looking to enroll in a debt management program to handle overwhelming unsecured debt like credit cards. To qualify, an applicant must demonstrate a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and a consistent monthly plan payment. Secondly, the individual must have a manageable amount of unsecured debt, as these programs typically have minimum and maximum limits and do not cover secured debts like mortgages. Finally, the person must be willing to commit to the program's strict rules, which often include closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling.</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel has shared a positive update on his health after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder involving excess fluid. In a recent podcast appearance, Joel stated that he feels good, despite the condition's intimidating name, and noted that his symptoms have been manageable. The 76-year-old had previously canceled his tour dates after the diagnosis, which caused issues with his balance, vision, and hearing. His update has reassured fans as a two-part HBO documentary about his life and career is currently being released.</p>

He advises swimmers to first and foremost stay calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract a shark's curiosity. Secondly, he recommends maintaining eye contact with the animal, as sharks prefer to ambush unseen prey. As a final resort, de Gelder suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to deter it, rather than punching. His advice aims to empower beachgoers and reduce fear through knowledge.</p>

          <p>Investigators have searched a boat in Marina del Rey as they continue to investigate the fatal explosion that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department bomb technicians. The deputies died when military-grade hand grenades they had collected from a Santa Monica storage unit detonated at a training facility. The search is part of a wider effort to determine the origin of the explosives and the circumstances leading to the blast. The ATF's national response team is assisting the LASD homicide unit in the complex investigation, which is expected to take several weeks or months.</p>

          <p>The ongoing trade war and tariff uncertainty are causing significant harm to smaller, secondary U.S. ports as shippers reroute cargo to larger hubs like Los Angeles. Ports in Oakland, Jacksonville, and New Orleans have seen reduced container volumes as companies front-load shipments to beat tariff deadlines, concentrating their logistics at major gateways. This market recalibration is threatening local economies and jobs that depend on consistent port traffic, particularly in areas like Oakland that handle significant agricultural exports. The trend is expected to continue, creating economic pain for communities reliant on these smaller trade hubs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a detailed breakdown of the maximum amounts students can borrow in federal student loans, which vary based on several key factors. The limits are determined by a student's dependency status, their year in school, and whether they are an undergraduate or graduate student. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500 annually, while a graduate student can borrow up to $20,500. The article notes that these federal limits may not cover the full cost of attendance, often creating a funding gap that students may need to fill with private loans.</p>

          <p>A significant dispute has erupted between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) over the level of care to be provided during an upcoming five-day doctors' strike. NHS England has instructed hospitals not to cancel non-urgent care except in extreme cases, a stark reversal from previous strikes. The BMA warns this policy will stretch non-striking senior doctors too thinly, putting emergency patient safety at risk by not having enough staff to provide cover. The row intensifies as talks continue between the government and the union to avert the walkout over a long-running pay dispute.</p>
