          <p>A major explosion occurred at a pesticide and medical chemical plant in Weifang, Shandong province, China, causing significant damage and a large plume of smoke. Windows were shattered at a storage warehouse over two miles away, and the blast shook homes in the vicinity, according to a local resident. Rescue efforts are underway, but the number of casualties is currently unknown, and local fire officials have dispatched over 230 personnel to the scene. The Gaomi Youdao Chemical Co., where the explosion took place, employs over 500 people and manufactures pesticides and medical chemicals. The article notes that the investigation is still underway to determine the cause of the explosion, and the impact on the surrounding environment is being assessed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the policy has contributed to poverty but acknowledged that removing the cap would be expensive. The Child Poverty Taskforce, led by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall, is evaluating the cap as part of a broader child poverty strategy due in the autumn. Phillipson emphasized that the taskforce is considering all options and that a Labour government would have different priorities, but she also highlighted the significant costs of inaction and the impact on children's life chances.</p>

          <p>According to nuclear security analyst Ankit Panda, the world has entered a new nuclear age characterized by renewed tensions between superpowers, the rise of China as a nuclear power, the collapse of arms control treaties, and destabilizing technological developments. In an interview, Panda discusses the increased risks of nuclear escalation, referencing the recent conflict between India and Pakistan as an example of the dynamics of this era. He emphasizes that while nuclear deterrence has been effective to some degree, it is not foolproof and relies on fallible human organizations. The article also explores the potential for nuclear proliferation among non-nuclear countries, especially in light of wavering US security guarantees.</p>

          <p>Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is increasing military spending and aiming for a stronger role in NATO amid concerns about Russia and pressure from the US for allies to bear more defense burden. Merz presided over the activation of a German tank brigade in Lithuania, signaling a commitment to European security. Germany plans to increase military spending to 3.5% of its economic output and another 1.5% on critical defense infrastructure, addressing shortcomings in its armed forces, including dilapidated barracks and staff shortages. This shift reflects a significant change for a country that has struggled to meet previous military spending targets.</p>

          <p>Former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, convicted of fraud and bribery for accepting over $75,000 in exchange for making businessmen law enforcement officers without proper training, has been pardoned by President Donald Trump. Jenkins, a Trump supporter, was sentenced to 10 years in prison but will not serve any time due to the pardon. Prosecutors stated that Jenkins accepted bribes from eight people, including undercover FBI agents, who sought auxiliary deputy sheriff positions to avoid traffic tickets and carry concealed firearms without permits. Trump claimed Jenkins was a victim of an overzealous Justice Department and that the judge refused to allow evidence in his defense.</p>

Instead, Kim visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, calling Putin "my closest friend and comrade" and hailing the alliance with Russia.

          <h2>Tesla Sales Plummet in Europe Amid Brand Concerns and Competition</h2>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and increased competition. Despite overall electric car sales rising in Europe, Tesla sold only 7,261 cars. The company faces challenges from traditional automakers and Chinese players, with BYD surpassing Tesla in pure electric car sales in Europe for the first time. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently address.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration is undertaking a systematic attack on knowledge, including education, science, and history, which undermines Americans' ability to understand the world. The administration is allegedly defunding colleges and universities, attacking scientific inquiry, distorting historical institutions, dismissing government scientists, and suppressing research. This assault aims to make the country more amenable to political domination and prevent democratic checks on behavior. The destruction of knowledge could lead to a new Dark Age by dismantling systems for aggregating and applying human knowledge, and the effects of this will be long lasting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall emissions for the first time, even as its energy demand and economic activity increased. This drop is largely attributed to China's aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, which has outpaced its electricity demand growth. The shift puts China ahead of schedule for its climate targets, including peaking emissions before 2030. However, the article notes that the decline could be temporary depending on economic growth and trade relations, and that China continues to emit high levels of other greenhouse gases.</p>

The article examines why manufacturing jobs might pay more, considering factors like unionization, safety risks, and the use of expensive machinery. It also discusses the decline in manufacturing's share of "good jobs" and the challenges of boosting the sector in the face of automation and offshoring.</p>

          <p>A group of British climbers scaled Mount Everest in less than a week using xenon gas to acclimatize to the altitude, sparking debate about ethics in mountaineering. The Nepalese government is investigating the use of the gas, which some believe enhances performance, while others argue its benefits are negligible and side effects unclear. The rapid climb raises questions about whether Everest should be made easier with performance enhancers, potentially devaluing the accomplishment. The use of xenon is also controversial because it is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances.</p>

          <p>This article explores the possibility of delaying or eliminating menopause through medical interventions, highlighting the potential benefits and drawbacks. While the loss of estrogen associated with menopause can lead to various health issues, the idea of eliminating it raises concerns about societal pressure on women to remain young and fertile. Researchers are exploring hormone therapy, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and medications like rapamycin to extend ovarian function. The article balances the potential health benefits with the social and emotional aspects of aging, emphasizing the need to support women through the menopausal transition rather than pathologizing it.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appealed to the U.S. to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to engage in meaningful peace talks to end the war, as drone strikes continue in both Ukraine and Russia. Zelenskyy condemned recent large-scale Russian strikes as lacking military logic and reflecting Putin's choice to continue the war. He urged for stronger sanctions against Russia to force respect for diplomacy, while expressing doubt about a Russian proposal for negotiations. The Ukrainian president is seeking to frame Putin as the key impediment to a peace deal, as Kyiv navigates a fractious bilateral relationship with President Donald Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>A new Greenpeace report, based on satellite images, suggests Russia is building power lines in occupied southeastern Ukraine to connect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its own grid. This indicates Moscow's intent to restart and exploit the plant, despite risks and international calls to address its status in peace talks. The construction involves more than 50 miles of electricity lines and pylons between Mariupol and Berdyansk, aimed at linking to a substation connected to the plant. Experts warn against restarting the plant under current conditions, but Russia has signaled its intent to power it back up.</p>

Traditional gender roles have made it less appealing for men to identify as consumers, while feminist messages have empowered women in the workplace.
