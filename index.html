          <p>Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have resulted in numerous deaths, including women and children, and have forced the closure of the main hospital in northern Gaza, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The Israeli military stated its operations target 'terror infrastructure sites' as part of a new offensive aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages. Mediators from the U.S. and Qatar are pushing for a ceasefire deal, but Hamas insists on a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. The ongoing conflict, which began in October 2023, has resulted in a high number of Palestinian casualties and a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached to end the New Jersey Transit strike, which halted train service for three days and disrupted commutes for hundreds of thousands of riders. The agreement, reached between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, will allow trains to resume a full schedule on Tuesday morning after safety inspections are completed. Governor Philip D. Murphy expressed relief and urged commuters to work from home on Monday to facilitate the resumption of service. The main sticking point had been the engineers’ demand that they be paid on par with their counterparts who drive trains for other passenger railroads.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, at age 82, has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to his office. The cancer is categorized as an aggressive form, with a Gleason score of 9, but appears to be hormone-sensitive, which could allow for effective management. While routine screening for prostate cancer in men over 75 is controversial, Biden's symptoms led to the discovery of a small nodule during a prostate exam. Treatment options are being reviewed, with the primary goal to control the disease, slow its progression, and preserve the former president's quality of life.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Mastermind: To Think Like a Killer," explores the story of Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric nursing professor who taught FBI agents how to profile serial killers. Beginning in the 1960s, Burgess interviewed sexual assault victims and identified patterns of behavior that revealed how killers think. Her work with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit led to high-profile cases, and she continues to apply her expertise to profiling school shooters and addressing unsolved murders in Indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>As wildfires become more severe in Europe due to climate change, experts are advocating for a shift in strategy towards learning to live with fires. Rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and land use changes are increasing the risk of extreme fires, necessitating preventative measures such as controlled burning, ecosystem restoration, and public education. The report emphasizes the need for landscape planners, foresters, and farmers to collaborate in managing flammable biomass and restoring carbon-rich peatlands, recognizing that low-intensity fires can be a natural part of the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan could rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The yuan is already used for cross-border purchase settlements, but China needs to deepen its financial markets to attract more foreign investment in yuan-denominated assets. The economist cited China's 'connect' schemes with Hong Kong as a model for increasing foreign access to mainland Chinese bonds and stocks, while also acknowledging convertibility as a concern for investors outside the mainland.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was diagnosed on Friday with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office said in a statement on Sunday. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a “small nodule” on his prostate. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management, according to the statement from Mr. Biden’s office, which was unsigned. President Trump, who has repeatedly bashed Mr. Biden and blames him for most of the country’s problems, was among those who issued supportive statements on Sunday evening.</p>
