          <p>President Trump responded to Elon Musk's criticism of his proposed tax bill, suggesting Musk is upset over the elimination of EV credits and the rejection of his NASA pick. Trump stated he prefers Musk criticizing him rather than the bill, emphasizing the bill's significance. Musk, who previously held a temporary government position and financially backed Trump's 2024 campaign, has been vocal about his disapproval on social media. Trump highlighted that Musk was aware of the EV credit removal from the outset, acknowledging the challenges faced by electric vehicle companies seeking subsidies. The administration continues to move forward with the proposed tax bill despite these concerns.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, also known as the "Devil in the Ozarks" and a former police chief, is believed to have fled Arkansas after escaping from prison last month.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a straight woman in a job discrimination suit, rejecting the appeals courtâ€™s requirement that members of majority groups meet a heightened standard to win employment discrimination cases. The justices voted unanimously, focusing on evidence standards and making it easier to file similar "reverse discrimination" cases. The court clarified that anti-discrimination and equal protection laws should apply to all Americans equally, regardless of their group affiliation. The decision effectively lowers the burden of proof required for people who are members of a majority group to make discrimination claims.</p>

          <h2>'The Life of Chuck' Review: An Apocalyptic Puzzle with Missing Pieces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 12:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews "The Life of Chuck," a film by Mike Flanagan based on a novella by Stephen King, which explores the idea that an ordinary accountant's life is as vast as "The Iliad." The movie uses a backward-structured triptych to tell the story of Chuck Krantz, played by Tom Hiddleston, and how his dying reverie affects the world around him. While the apocalyptic opening is praised, the film loses its verve as it progresses, and the final section is considered banal. Despite its philosophical puzzles not fully adding up, the reviewer appreciates the film's exploration of making magic out of the mundane.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein can contribute to happiness by understanding the limitations of language. Wittgenstein believed that language is a crude model of the world, inadequate for conveying subtle truths or subjective experiences. He suggested that misunderstanding lowers well-being and that true meaning cannot be found solely through words. The author recommends meditative contemplation and seeking understanding rather than exact answers to transcend the limitations of language and find deeper meaning.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of U.S. gun manufacturers, blocking a lawsuit filed by the government of Mexico. Mexico sought to hold the companies accountable for the trafficking of their weapons across the border, which fuels violence by cartels. Justice Elena Kagan stated that federal law grants broad immunity to U.S. gun companies, protecting them from Mexico's claims. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005 generally shields gun manufacturers from liability over the illegal acts of individuals using their guns.</p>
