          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana expressed concern that a 2-year-old U.S. citizen was deported to Honduras without due process and against the wishes of her father. The judge questioned why the child was sent abroad with her mother, despite the father's attempt to stop the deportation. Asserting that deporting a U.S. citizen is illegal, the judge scheduled a hearing to investigate the matter, raising concerns about potential government overreach.</p>
