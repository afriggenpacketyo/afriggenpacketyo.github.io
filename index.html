          <p>A deadly explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, is being investigated by the FBI as an intentional act of terrorism. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, resulted in one fatality and four injuries, with the epicenter traced to a vehicle explosion near American Reproductive Centers. Authorities are working to determine if the attack was domestic or international in nature, and have identified a person of interest but emphasize the community is no longer at immediate risk. The clinic confirmed its staff were unharmed and sensitive medical materials remain secure.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts are causing anxiety among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for essential healthcare services. A Congressional Budget Office analysis suggests that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. Many Republicans argue the cuts aim to eliminate fraud without affecting necessary coverage, but individuals like Rosa Andresen, who cares for her disabled daughter, worry about losing access to vital medications and mobility tools. Jodie Montplaisir, a mother in recovery from opioid use disorder, fears that work requirements tied to Medicaid could derail her progress and hinder others seeking treatment.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailboat, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in injuries to nineteen people, with three seriously injured. The ship, carrying 277 people, sustained significant damage to its masts and rigging. According to the New York City Department of Transportation, the bridge was inspected and found to have no major damage, but all lanes were briefly closed. The incident is under investigation, and authorities stated that the ship's pilot experienced 'mechanical issues' while navigating the vessel out of the channel.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a hiker who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains for weeks, recounted her survival story after being found in a cabin. Slaton said she became trapped by an avalanche and later immobilized after a fall, forcing her to subsist on wild leeks and melted snow. She attempted to call 911 multiple times without success, but used her GPS to guide her toward the nearest Starbucks, which she described as a 'long, arduous journey.' After losing her tent and sleeping bags, she relied on her foraging skills, a lighter, and a knife until she was found by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort.</p>

The refugees, mostly women and children, crossed the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR. Rwandan authorities said that over 101,000 refugees have been repatriated already, including 1,500 since the beginning of 2025, with returnees receiving support for reintegration into Rwandan society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic tour through the Middle East signals a shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemingly sidelined. Trump engaged in peace deals in Iran and Yemen and pursued business deals with Gulf nations without making a stop in Israel. This new dynamic is evident in Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria and pursue negotiations with Iran, actions that diverge from Netanyahu's preferences. Experts suggest Trump's focus has shifted to the Gulf States, where significant financial opportunities exist, leading to concerns in Israel about its diminished role in the region.</p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, driven by a changing global landscape and the Trump administration's shifting policies. A summit in London is expected to yield a defense and security agreement to bolster European military security, alongside relaxed trade rules and deepened energy cooperation. While challenges remain, the overarching theme is adapting to a world where the United States is less engaged, prompting Britain and the EU to address shared problems collaboratively. However, pro-Brexit voices in the UK media criticize any moves towards closer ties with the EU.</p>

Despite the challenges, she has flown over 30 combat missions and encourages other women to pursue aviation careers. While the government passed a law allowing women to serve in combat roles in 2018, deeply rooted stereotypes persist, leading to marginalization and underutilization of women in the armed forces.</p>

According to the team from the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, the gyroscope could offer a more stable way to measure navigation for aircraft, ships and oil rigs. Gyroscopes are devices that can sense orientation and the rate at which a moving object is turning, so they play an important role in inertial navigation systems.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have announced the development of a new fiber-optic gyroscope designed to provide more stable navigation across a broad temperature range. This gyroscope, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, offers a potential improvement for inertial navigation systems in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. Unlike traditional gyroscopes that use moving mechanical components, fiber-optic gyroscopes rely on the movement of light in optical fibers, providing immunity to interference and making them valuable for military and security applications.</p>

For example, Shily Zhou, a Shanghai resident, traveled to Chengdu to see a concert and received a discount to visit the Taoist mountain Qingchengshan.

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes across the U.S. Midwest and South have resulted in at least 26 deaths, with Kentucky being particularly hard-hit. The storms, part of a broader weather system, brought tornadoes to Wisconsin, extreme heat to Texas, and dust storms to Illinois. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem offered federal resources to the affected states. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear described widespread devastation and the likelihood of the death toll rising. The storms highlight the ongoing challenges of severe weather and disaster response in the region.</p>

          <p>With Donald Trump’s headline-making tour of the Gulf region now over, focus has now fallen on the deals made during the trip – for US companies, and for the president himself. Former White House lawyers, diplomatic protocol officers and foreign affairs experts have told the Guardian Donald Trump’s receipt of overseas gifts and targeted investments are “unprecedented” as the White House remakes US foreign policy under a pay-for-access code that eclipses past administrations. Meanwhile, the agreement struck by major US companies saw prominent executives negotiate their deals face-to-face with Gulf country leaders. Many of those agreements broke with the policies of Joe Biden’s administration, which imposed strict controls on the sales of the US’s most cutting-edge technology.</p>

The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, reduced visibility to a quarter-mile in Chicago and created hazardous driving conditions. The region's exceptionally dry soil contributed to the intensity of the storm, reminiscent of dust storms during the Dust Bowl era. Meteorologists noted that this was the first time a dust storm warning had been issued for Chicago.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and for others over age 12 who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk from Covid. Scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who typically make decisions on who should get approved shots and when,\nhave been debating\nwhether to recommend Covid shots only to the most vulnerable Americans. The F.D.A.’s decision appeared to render at least part of their discussion moot.\nThe new restriction will sharply limit access to the Novavax vaccine for people under 65 who are in good health. It may leave Americans who do not have underlying conditions at risk if a more virulent version of the coronavirus were to emerge. It could also limit options for people who want the vaccine for a wide array of reasons, including to protect a vulnerable loved one.\nThe vaccine had previously been authorized under emergency use. Covid vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which are more widely used by Americans, were granted full approval in 2022. However, the companies are working on updated shots for the fall, and the new restrictions on the Novavax shot portend a more restrictive approach from the F.D.A.</p>
