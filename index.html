          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker delivered a passionate speech in New Hampshire, criticizing Donald Trump and calling for “mass protests,” which has fueled speculation about a possible presidential bid in 2028. Pritzker, a billionaire, positioned himself as an outspoken opponent of Trump's policies, contrasting himself with other Democratic governors who advocate for bipartisan collaboration. His confrontational stance reflects a growing sentiment among Democratic activists who seek a more aggressive approach to opposing Trump. Pritzker's advisors drew parallels between the current political climate and 1930s Germany, emphasizing the need for strong resistance.</p>

          <p>The Department of Energy (DOE) reports saving taxpayers over $700 million in President Trump's first 100 days by eliminating programs deemed "wasteful." These savings stem from the cancellation of contracts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as climate change goals associated with the Green New Deal. The Trump administration projects further savings of $3 billion from additional contract cancellations. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) estimates broader savings across the government at $160 billion during this period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores how countries like Japan, Chile, Mexico, and Canada have learned to live with earthquakes by implementing strategies that minimize devastation. Japan uses early warning systems and seismic-resistant building codes, while Chile strengthened its disaster policies after the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Mexico developed an earthquake early warning system after the 1985 earthquake, and Canada focuses on creating community response spaces. These countries demonstrate that preparation, innovation, and community involvement are key to mitigating the impact of earthquakes.</p>

In response, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called for an immediate ceasefire lasting "at least 30 days".
