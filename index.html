          <p>A shooting at a Baptist church in Lexington, Kentucky, resulted in the deaths of two women, identified as a mother and daughter. The incident began when the suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop, then fled and carjacked a vehicle before arriving at the church. Family members allege the suspect, who was killed by police at the scene, had severe mental health and drug issues and was looking for his ex-partner. Two other men, including the church's pastor, were also wounded in the attack.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has announced that its corporate employees must return to the office four days a week starting in October. As part of this policy shift, the company is offering a voluntary exit program with a cash payment for those who do not wish to comply. This move is part of CEO Brian Niccol's broader strategy to reverse slumping sales by improving efficiency and focusing on the in-person, human connection aspect of the brand. The company has been progressively tightening its return-to-office requirements over the past year.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's new plan for Ukraine represents a decisive strategic pivot toward a "peace through strength" doctrine. The policy involves the U.S. selling military equipment to NATO allies, who then transfer it to Ukraine, ensuring allies share the financial burden. The author praises this as a smart mechanism that empowers NATO and sends an unmistakable message to Moscow. This shift is combined with a 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace or face severe secondary tariffs.</p>

          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab soared 8% on Monday, building on a rally that has seen the stock nearly double in value over the last two months. The strong performance is attributed to a series of successful Electron rocket launches and a new contract with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company's growth reflects increasing demand in the competitive commercial space industry, where it competes with firms like SpaceX. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a startling 763% increase in the rate of children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. These smoke-free products, like the popular brand Zyn, contain nicotine that can be fatally toxic to young children. Researchers warn that the flavored products and colorful packaging are attractive to kids and that these ingestions are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes compared to other nicotine products.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why the typically influential health care lobby failed to prevent significant cuts to Medicaid in President Trump's recent tax and spending bill. Lobbyists and experts suggest that Republican lawmakers were more concerned with securing a major legislative victory for Trump than with the dire warnings from hospitals and insurers. The industry's past support for the Affordable Care Act may have also diminished its reservoir of goodwill with the GOP, leading to a rare political loss on a key issue.</p>
