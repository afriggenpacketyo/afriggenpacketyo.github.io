          <p>A targeted drive-by shooting occurred outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago’s River North neighborhood, leaving four people dead and fourteen injured. The incident took place as a crowd was leaving an album release party for rapper Mello Buckzz, with police stating some victims were part of the rapper's inner circle. Authorities are investigating the attack, which they believe involved three shooters using multiple firearms, and are preparing for potential retaliatory violence. The venue, which has a history of violence under previous ownership, has been shut down by the city as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The regulator accused the firm of a "deliberate strategy" to manipulate India's Nifty 50 index by making large stock purchases to drive the index up, placing bets on its decline, and then selling off its holdings to profit from the resulting drop. SEBI called the firm an "untrustworthy actor," noting the behavior continued even after an official warning. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated it is committed to regulatory compliance.

          <p>Chinese officials have reiterated their commitment to tackling the persistent issues of oversupply and "disorderly low-price competition" within the nation's dominant solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. During a meeting with industry leaders, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology emphasized the need for lawful governance and the phasing out of outdated production capacity to ensure healthy, sustainable development. This follows a high-level commission meeting where President Xi Jinping also called for addressing excess industrial capacity. The government is urging companies to focus on product quality to consolidate China's global advantage in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has warned that the Iranian government is intensifying its repression of citizens, particularly activists, in the wake of its recent conflict with Israel. In a message from Tehran, she stated that the regime is using the war to deflect from internal issues and is escalating arrests and executions to "spread fear and terror." Mohammadi described dire conditions for political prisoners, especially those transferred from the damaged Evin Prison, and called for renewed international focus on Iran's human rights abuses. Despite facing pressure and the seizure of her Nobel prize money, she remains committed to fighting for democracy.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move announced by the Taliban's foreign minister after a meeting in Kabul. This makes Russia the first country to grant formal recognition since the group seized power in 2021. The Russian Foreign Ministry stated the decision would boost bilateral cooperation, including efforts to combat terrorism and drug trafficking, which critics view as a prioritization of strategic interests over human rights. The Taliban's rule has been marked by severe restrictions on civil liberties, especially for women, drawing widespread international condemnation.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a state with a key early presidential primary, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. His visit will focus on economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable counties, which the state's Democratic Party chair says is an effort to show these voters they are not forgotten. While a political advisor for Newsom denies the trip is about a presidential run, insisting the focus is on the 2026 midterms, the move follows other overtures to Southern voters. The tour will take him through several heavily Republican counties.</p>

The scheme allegedly generated over $5 million for the regime and, in one case, involved stealing over $900,000 in cryptocurrency. A spokesperson for the DPRK's Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of fabricating the drama and threatening its citizens' rights.</p>

          <p>A large coalition of more than 175 Democratic members of Congress is filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit against the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Education. The lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jamie Raskin, argue that the administration lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish the department, which has seen its workforce slashed by nearly half. The legal action contends that only Congress can create or abolish federal agencies. The move comes as the administration has also paused over $6 billion in congressionally approved education funding ahead of the new school year.</p>

Officials are advising the public to avoid swimming, surfing, or any activity involving contact with the ocean water at the specified locations, which include areas of Santa Monica Beach, Mothers Beach, and Avalon Beach on Catalina Island. The elevated bacteria levels are attributed to street runoff, and contact with the contaminated water poses a risk of illness and skin infections.

Additionally, the order mandates that U.S. residents receive preferential treatment in park access systems, such as lotteries or permitting.

This trend contradicts official statements focusing on "the worst of the worst," according to a UCLA professor involved in the project.

          <p>Recent staffing cuts within the National Park Service (NPS) are creating safety concerns at popular summer destinations like Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore, where lifeguard towers are now shuttered. An advocacy group reports the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration took office, with thousands of seasonal positions remaining unfilled. The cuts are a result of a hiring freeze and a broader push to reduce the federal workforce. Local officials and park advocates warn that the lack of personnel, particularly lifeguards, puts the millions of annual visitors at increased risk of accidents and drownings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed President Trump's major legislative package, a sweeping bill that extends tax cuts, increases defense spending, and boosts funding for immigration enforcement. The measure, which the White House dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," was approved by a tight 218-214 margin and now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. The passage followed a contentious overnight session where Republican leadership worked to overcome internal opposition from both moderate and conservative members who were concerned about changes made in the Senate version. The nonpartisan CBO estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over ten years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's direction under the Trump administration. The employees' letter argued that the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment, citing policies that weaken regulations on pollution and climate change. In response, the EPA accused the career staff of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions. The employees are on leave pending an administrative investigation, which the agency insists is not a disciplinary action.</p>

Fuyao University of Science and Technology, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, founded by semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, represent a new trend of philanthropic efforts to advance China's goal of "scientific self-reliance." Observers predict these institutions will become highly selective and may soon compete with top public universities for students.

While acquitted of the most serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges, he was convicted on two lesser counts of transporting women for sex acts and faces up to 10 years in prison for each. The trial revealed sordid details of his private life, which will likely tarnish his legacy as a hip-hop pioneer who launched the careers of major artists. Despite the convictions, some observers believe his dedicated fanbase may still support a comeback attempt after he serves his sentence.</p>

The committee also highlighted widespread evidence of worker exploitation, including debt bondage and excessive hours, accusing the department of being "slow and ineffective" in tackling the issue.

Vought, a co-author of Project 2025, advocates for a radical reduction in the size and scope of the federal government, which he views as largely unconstitutional. The new legislation's significant cuts to federal safety net programs like Medicaid reflect his belief that much of the spending is improper and fraudulent.
