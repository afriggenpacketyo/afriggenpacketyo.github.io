          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 22:14:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline after President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates preemptively to stimulate the economy. Trump's remarks exacerbated market turmoil already fueled by his tariff plans and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell sharply, while gold prices reached record highs as investors sought safe-haven assets. This situation highlights the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the independent Federal Reserve, raising concerns about the stability of the US economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China witnessed the establishment of nearly 2 million new private companies in the first quarter of the year, marking a 7.1% increase from the previous year. This growth is seen as a sign of resilience in the face of the US-China trade war, which is expected to disproportionately affect private businesses. Private firms contribute to over half of China's exports, and this expansion underscores the sector's importance to the Chinese economy. However, analysts remain concerned about the vulnerability of these businesses to potential US tariffs.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate nearly 1,650 city worker positions through layoffs to address a $1-billion financial gap. The cuts would affect various departments, including the LAPD, which would see over 400 civilian employees laid off. The budget prioritizes hiring for the Fire Department, but other agencies face deep spending reductions.

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, dubbed the "doomsday mom," delivered her closing argument in her Arizona trial, where she is charged with conspiring to murder her fourth husband. Daybell maintains that her brother shot her husband in self-defense. Prosecutors argue the shooting was a ploy to obtain a life insurance policy and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. Daybell is already serving a life sentence for the murders of her two children. The jury is deliberating the verdict in this latest trial.</p>

          <p>Attorneys in sexual assault cases against L.A. County allege that thousands of documents, potentially containing key details about abuse inside a defunct detention camp, were not turned over.

The attorneys discovered these records during a visit to Camp Scott, a former probation camp where their clients allege they were sexually assaulted as children.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions of dollars in federal funding. The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions violate Harvard's constitutional rights and threaten academic independence. The Trump administration's actions are part of a broader effort to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights, according to the lawsuit. Harvard isn't the only university facing pressure from the Trump administration, which has said it is taking action against some schools to ensure they combat anti-semitism on campuses.</p>

          <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia. The decision follows a trade case brought by American manufacturers accusing overseas rivals of flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods.
