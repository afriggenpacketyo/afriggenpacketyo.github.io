        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports that U.S. exports are slumping due to trade tariffs, impacting the agricultural sector significantly, with products like soybeans, corn, and beef being hit the hardest. Port data reveals decreases in exports across various ports, with the Port of Oregon experiencing a 51% decrease. Simultaneously, U.S. imports are also declining, leading to concerns about lean retail inventories and potential supply disruptions, particularly as retailers prepare for the holiday shopping season. The article also mentions that Matson, a Hawaii-based freight liner operator, has lowered its 2025 outlook due to these trade-related challenges.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, who was detained during a citizenship interview. Mahdawi, a green card holder and vocal critic of President Trump's policies, asserts that he will not be silenced despite the administration's attempts to intimidate activists. He was detained under a law allowing visa revocations for individuals believed to pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." Mahdawi, along with other student activists, is challenging the legality of these detentions, arguing they violate First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The article reports on a newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies that contradicts President Trump's justification for deporting Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that intelligence agencies do not believe that Venezuelan President Maduro's regime controls the criminal gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump claimed was destabilizing the U.S. at Maduro's direction. The memo's release undermines the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act and calls into question its criticism of media coverage that contradicted its claims.</p>

This failure is seen as unprecedented in modern German history, and the Bundestag will have 14 days to choose a candidate with an absolute majority.

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his bid to become mayor of New York City, has released a plan to address the city's mental health crisis, focusing on removing severely mentally ill individuals from the streets. The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment after hospital and jail discharges, and increasing supportive housing units and psychiatric beds. Cuomo's opponents argue that he worsened the mental health system during his time as governor.</p>

          <p>A chair of a trial committee of the Writers Guild of America West (WGAW) has criticized the union's disciplinary proceedings against a member accused of violating strike rules, calling the process "flawed" and "improper." Jill Goldsmith, the trial committee chair, conveyed concerns over the board's decision to expel writer Roma Roth, arguing that the process was not fair. Roth was expelled for allegedly writing during the strike for a non-signatory company, despite the trial committee initially proposing a five-year suspension.</p>
