          <p>Villanova University officials announced that a report of an active shooter at its law school was a "cruel hoax," causing widespread panic but no injuries. The false alarm triggered a significant response from local and federal law enforcement, who swept the campus before declaring it safe. Pennsylvania's governor and the local district attorney have confirmed that the incident, known as "swatting," is a serious crime and that a full investigation is underway to find and prosecute the perpetrators responsible for the terrifying event.</p>

While the center stated it will soon announce a "new direction" for its dance programming, the firings have raised concerns among some curators, with one noting that many have chosen to leave since the leadership change. This restructuring occurs alongside a significant $257 million funding increase for the cultural institution, which was included in the President's "Big Beautiful Bill."</p>

          <p>Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat who has served in Congress since 1995, announced he will not run for another term if the new Republican-drawn congressional map in Texas is enacted. The proposed map reconfigures Austin-area districts, creating a scenario where Doggett would have to compete against fellow progressive Democrat Greg Casar in a primary. Doggett stated he prefers to focus on opposing the Trump administration rather than engaging in an intra-party battle, a decision that averts a potentially divisive primary for Texas Democrats.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project on Oak Flat, a site sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona. Following a meeting with mining executives, Trump criticized a recent court decision that temporarily halted the transfer of federal land to the multinational mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP. The tribe and its supporters, including environmental and religious liberty groups, celebrated the court's reprieve as a crucial, albeit possibly temporary, victory in their long-standing legal battle to protect the sacred land from being turned into a massive industrial crater.</p>

          <p>California's Democratic-controlled legislature has approved a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas. The proposal, which will go before voters in a special election, aims to create up to five new Democratic-leaning U.S. House seats, effectively neutralizing the gains Republicans expect from their new Texas map. Governor Gavin Newsom framed the move as "fighting fire with fire," marking an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle between the nation's two most populous states over control of Congress.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 9-5 victory against the Colorado Rockies, allowing them to split the four-game series at Coors Field. The offense was productive early, with Freddie Freeman hitting a two-run homer in the first inning, and the team scored in each of the first five innings. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw earned his eighth win of the season, despite giving up a few runs over five and two-thirds innings. This win provides the Dodgers with needed momentum as they head to San Diego for a crucial series against the second-place Padres.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, ruling the amount was excessive. While the court upheld the finding that Trump was liable for fraud, it determined the massive fine likely violated constitutional protections against severe punishments. The ruling keeps non-monetary penalties in place, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state for three years. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the financial aspect of the decision to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>Excitement for the Oasis reunion tour is building in Los Angeles, where fans lined up for hours to visit the band's North American pop-up shop. The store offers exclusive merchandise, including special edition vinyl and an Adidas collaboration, celebrating the band's first local concerts in 15 years. The event drew a multi-generational crowd, reflecting the British rock band's enduring appeal decades after their famously chaotic 1994 debut in the city.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock price fell over 7% on Thursday, wiping out nearly $100 million in market value, following the debut of a new company logo. The redesign removes the iconic image of "Uncle Herschel," the man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a more modern and streamlined wordmark. This change is part of a broader brand refresh aimed at increasing relevance, but it has drawn criticism from some conservative commentators and marketing experts who believe the company is unwisely abandoning its well-established, nostalgic identity.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's sold-out concert residency in San Juan has created an unexpected boom for local tattoo artists, as fans seek permanent souvenirs inspired by the artist and Puerto Rican culture. Artists are seeing a surge in requests for designs like the island's national flower and the native coquí frog, symbols featured in the rapper's latest album. This has provided local artists not only with increased business during a typically slow season but also an opportunity to educate tourists about the cultural significance behind the symbols they are choosing.</p>

          <p>The Texas House has approved a new congressional map designed to create five additional Republican-held seats, a move pushed by President Trump to bolster the party's narrow majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. This unusual mid-decade redistricting represents an aggressive partisan maneuver that could single-handedly determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives. The action has prompted a response from California, which is now pursuing its own redistricting to add Democratic seats, escalating a national political battle over legislative boundaries.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance traveled to Georgia to promote the tax cuts and policies within President Trump's recently signed domestic agenda bill. Speaking at a manufacturing facility, Vance framed the legislation as a win for working families and attacked Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff for voting against it, previewing a likely campaign theme for the 2026 midterms. In response, Ossoff criticized the bill, highlighting a nonpartisan CBO estimate that it could cause millions to lose health coverage and pointing to a local hospital that is already warning of budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Newly released public records reveal that during immigration raids in Los Angeles, the U.S. military identified specific hotels for federal agents to avoid due to "harassment" from protesters. Community activists had organized demonstrations, some lasting through the night, at hotels where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were staying, pressuring the establishments to evict them. The documents, which show military officials tracking the protests, suggest the community-led actions were successful in disrupting the logistics of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the city.</p>

          <p>Six people were found dead at a dairy farm in Weld County, Colorado, after emergency crews responded to a call for a "confined space rescue." The Weld County Coroner's Office reported that the victims were all men and that preliminary findings suggest exposure to some type of gas was the cause of the tragedy. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched an investigation into the incident, though the local sheriff's office has stated that no criminal activity is suspected at this time.</p>
