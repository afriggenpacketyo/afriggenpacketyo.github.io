          <h2>Analyst Doubts China Will Use Navy to Secure Hormuz Strait</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top US analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Richard Fontaine from the Center for a New American Security believes China would favor quiet negotiations and protecting its own interests over direct military intervention. He cited a past agreement between Beijing and Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, where Chinese-flagged vessels were spared from attacks. The analyst suggests that China's economic interests will continue to shape its approach in the region. Optimism regarding the geopolitical stability of the region is reflected in this analysis.</p>

          <p>A shooting at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulted in one person injured and the death of the suspect. Police Chief Ryan Strong reported that the suspect, Brian Anthony Browning, arrived at the church and began firing at the building with a long gun and handgun, while wearing a tactical vest. A parishioner struck the suspect with their vehicle, and at least two staff members returned fire, killing the attacker, who was pronounced dead at the scene. One of the staff members, a security guard, was shot in the leg, and both employees were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The overall tragic nature of the event is reflected in the tone of the article.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of economic security as national security, highlighting the strategy's potential to create jobs and growth. The strategy also focuses on enhancing the UK's competitiveness in science, education, trade, and technology. The government expects to reach 4.1% spending by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the constitutional ambiguity surrounding the authority to declare war in the context of modern military actions. It highlights the tension between Congress's power to "declare War" and the President's role as "Commander in Chief." The piece references the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and its broad application by multiple presidents. Various lawmakers express differing views on the need for congressional approval before engaging in military strikes, particularly concerning Iran. The article concludes that the balance of power has shifted over time, with Congress relinquishing many of its war powers to the executive branch.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Iran's Limited Retaliation Could Lead to De-escalation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 17:38:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential outcomes of recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran's subsequent response. It suggests that Iran's missile attack on a US base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties, might signal a desire to de-escalate the conflict. President Trump's reaction, describing the Iranian response as "very weak," further supports this possibility. The article draws a parallel to the 2020 Soleimani killing, where a limited Iranian response led to a period of reduced tensions. The potential for peace and harmony in the region is dependent on the actions of both Iran and the United States.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has overturned a lower court's order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homelands. The ruling reverses a requirement for the government to provide migrants with an opportunity to express potential risks in being deported to a third country. The three liberal justices dissented, criticizing the decision as rewarding lawlessness. This decision marks another victory for President Trump's administration in its efforts to implement mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are backing an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs have signed an amendment that would give them an opportunity to vote on a proposal to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety. The welfare reform bill includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The amendment cites concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences on the jobs market and on people's health.</p>

While some officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump, claimed the Iranian nuclear ambitions had been "obliterated," others have been more cautious. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said it will "take some time" to assess the damage. Experts have also expressed skepticism, noting that the underground structure of the Fordo enrichment site may have withstood the attacks.
