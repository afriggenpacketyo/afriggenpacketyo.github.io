          <p>Donald Trump has signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University for an initial six-month period, citing national security concerns. The order suspends the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard, alleging the university's conduct makes it an unsuitable destination. Harvard responded by calling Trump's proclamation ‚Äúyet another illegal retaliatory step‚Äù and affirmed its commitment to protecting its international students. The administration has been engaged in a tense standoff with Harvard, freezing grants and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, leading to legal challenges. The move targets Harvard's connections with China, claiming the university is linked to research that could advance China‚Äôs military modernization (not investment advice).</p>

The situation is further complicated by ongoing tensions in the region and the need for impartial and efficient aid distribution. The foundation aims to provide humanitarian assistance amidst challenging circumstances.

          <p>Zhou Jianbin, a next-generation battery expert with experience in the US, has returned to a Chinese university to continue his research on solid-state battery technologies. Zhou earned his PhD at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and worked at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the University of California, San Diego before joining Sonocharge Energy. His research focuses on electrode materials and electrolytes for high-performance solid-state metal batteries, as well as the application of novel electrochemical materials in fields such as catalysis and biomedicine. This move highlights the ongoing competition between nations to secure technological advantages and talent in the field of battery innovation. Zhou's return is viewed as a strategic gain for China's efforts to advance its battery technology sector.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The proclamation cites national security interests, asserting that these countries lack sufficient vetting and screening processes. Additionally, partial restrictions have been placed on nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The policy, which takes effect on June 9, mirrors a similar ban from 2017 and has faced criticism and legal challenges.

          <p>The Education Department has threatened to revoke Columbia University's accreditation, alleging violations of federal anti-discrimination laws and failure to address anti-Semitism on campus after the October 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. The department's civil rights office notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education that Columbia was out of compliance, citing President Trump's executive order on accreditation standards. Losing accreditation would render Columbia ineligible for federal financial aid, including student loans and Pell Grants. Columbia has stated that it is committed to combating anti-Semitism and is working with the federal government to address these concerns, as the accreditation group confirmed receipt of the Education Department's letter.</p>

          <p>Thousands of students are facing uncertainty as the Trump administration seeks to shut down Job Corps centers nationwide. The Labor Department announced a "phased pause" in operations at 99 contractor-operated centers, citing concerns over outcomes and serious incident reports. A U.S. District Judge temporarily blocked the administration from eliminating the program while a lawsuit from Job Corps contractors plays out. The program, funded by Congress in 1964, offers career training, housing, and assistance to young people aged 16 to 24. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have criticized the administration's move, arguing that it is illegal. The ruling temporarily allows the program to remain open until a hearing on June 17th.</p>

          <h2>US-Iran Nuclear Talks Face Uncertainty Amid Disagreements</h2>

          <p>High-stakes negotiations over Iran's nuclear program face uncertainty as the U.S. and Iran publicly disagree over the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the proposal, stating that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its own soil. President Trump contradicted his negotiators by stating that any agreement would not allow any enrichment of uranium. Despite a potential meeting in the coming days, optimism among both U.S. and Iranian officials has cooled, with an Iranian official calling the U.S.' proposed terms unreasonable and unconventional. The future of the negotiations remains uncertain.</p>

The Mail highlights opposing immigration policies from Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. The Telegraph reports that Reeves has been forced to drop net-zero cuts due to pressure from Ed Miliband.

Squaxin Island is of cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe, which supports the cleanup effort to maintain clean beaches and water. The DNR has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels since the program began in 2002, with at least 300 more remaining.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study, published in Science Bulletin, examined feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. Researchers found that the development of feathers capable of generating thrust and lift was essential for birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly, though some could glide or have powered flight. The study underscores the significance of feather evolution in the development of avian flight.</p>

          <p>A UK study has found that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's gut can protect against dangerous infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute found that Bifidobacterium longum, an early inhabitant of the human body, seemed to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The study tracked over 1,000 newborns and analyzed their stool samples to identify which species were present and how common they were. The protective bacteria were more common in babies born via vaginal delivery. Further research is needed to understand how these bacteria interact with the immune system.</p>

Sable officials said the decision would delay their restart timeline to August 1, 2025.

The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it's unknown whether these medicines could harm an unborn baby. Women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. Weight-loss injections may make the contraceptive pill less effective in overweight or obese women.
