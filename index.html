            <p>The Los Angeles Kings defeated the Anaheim Ducks 6-1, increasing their lead over the Edmonton Oilers in the Pacific Division. Kevin Fiala scored two goals, while Quinton Byfield, Anze Kopitar, Alex Laferriere, and Jordan Spence each added one. Ducks' Cutter Gauthier scored their lone goal, while Kings' goalie Darcy Kuemper extended his streak of allowing two or fewer goals to 15 games. The Kings' victory brings them closer to securing home-ice advantage for the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, where they are likely to face the Oilers. The Kings have a strong home record, which could be a deciding factor in the series. Optimism score: 75</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's initial plan for sweeping tariffs faced a partial reversal after suspending higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while escalating trade tensions with China. Despite this adjustment, the article assesses Trump's progress on key trade ambitions, including securing better trade deals, boosting American industry, confronting China, raising revenue, and lowering consumer prices. While negotiations with countries like South Korea and Japan are underway, instability from fluctuating tariff levels could hinder business investments. The confrontation with China carries significant risks, and the potential for increased revenue from tariffs may diminish as domestic production increases.

With the US imposing significant tariffs on China, the EU perceives itself as less targeted and therefore in a stronger negotiating position.

            <p>The article discusses the market volatility caused by Donald Trump's erratic tariff decisions, highlighting the potential for a small group of people to profit from the instability. It suggests that Trump's partial U-turn on tariffs was driven by market reactions and threats to US Treasury bonds. The piece argues that Europe should not grovel but instead recognize its own power and offer itself as a stable alternative to the US. It also emphasizes the importance of Europe strengthening its energy independence by replacing fossil fuels with renewables. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has terminated $5.1 billion in IT and consulting contracts, including those with Accenture and Deloitte, labeling them as 'wasteful spending'. The cuts target consulting services, DEI initiatives, climate matters, and the Pentagon's COVID-19 response. The savings will be reallocated to 'Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence'. Hegseth thanked Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency for identifying wasteful spending. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>Michelle Obama has dismissed rumors of an impending divorce from Barack Obama, attributing her absence from high-profile events to personal choices as a 'grown woman'. She expressed frustration with societal expectations that prevent people from believing she can make decisions for herself. Mrs. Obama shared that she felt some guilt for stepping back from certain duties, a thing that women struggle with. She emphasized her decision to prioritize what's best for herself rather than conforming to external expectations. Optimism score: 85</p>

Khalil's attorneys criticize the memo and plan to request to depose Rubio. The case could set a precedent for silencing critics and removing them. Optimism score: 20</p>
