          <p>Online ticket seller StubHub saw its shares fall 6.4% during its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, raising $800 million, but closed at $22 after an initial rise. This long-awaited IPO follows previous delays due to market volatility and comes amid a recent surge in tech offerings. StubHub's financials show 10% revenue growth in the first quarter but also a widening net loss.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company after 47 years, citing a conflict with parent company Unilever over social activism. Greenfield stated that Unilever has undermined the ice cream brand's independence and silenced its ability to speak on global issues, including the conflict in Gaza. The departure highlights long-standing tensions between the brand's activist mission and its corporate ownership. Unilever responded that it remains committed to the brand's unique mission.</p>

          <p>The state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to the U.K. has put a spotlight on "fashion diplomacy," with experts analyzing the sartorial choices of key figures. Melania Trump's wide-brimmed hat and use of British designer Burberry were interpreted as carefully chosen statements. Likewise, the coordinated color schemes of Queen Camilla and the Princess of Wales were seen as potential nods to the U.S. flag. These clothing selections are viewed as powerful, non-verbal tools for conveying political and diplomatic messages during high-profile international events.</p>

          <p>A dive team has successfully identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing boat that sank in a storm in January 1929. The vessel was lost with all 21 crew members aboard, and previous searches had been unsuccessful. Using sonar scans and examining distinctive features like the ship's winch and steam engine, researchers confirmed its identity. The discovery is considered a bittersweet moment, offering potential closure to the descendants of the men who perished nearly a century ago.</p>

For those with overwhelming balances, debt settlement programs are presented as another potential path toward regaining financial control. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Susan Monarez, the ousted director of the CDC, testified before a Senate committee that she was fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for refusing to preemptively accept vaccine recommendations and dismiss career officials. She asserted this pushback against what she saw as political interference was the "true reason" for her dismissal, directly countering Kennedy's previous claims that she was untrustworthy. The hearing highlighted a significant conflict over scientific independence within the nation's top public health agency.</p>

          <p>With Bitcoin's value rising nearly 100% in the past year, more Americans are considering adding cryptocurrency to their retirement portfolios, a move made easier by new brokerage offerings. Financial experts remain divided on the strategy, with some warning of the asset's inherent volatility and risk, while others see potential for high returns if managed carefully. Advisors who support crypto investment generally recommend it only for those with high risk tolerance and suggest allocating no more than 5% to 15% of a portfolio to such assets.

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly retorted after United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby declared that the ultra-low-cost airline model is dead, following the recent bankruptcy of Spirit Airlines. Biffle called Kirby's comment "cute" and argued that the industry's primary issue is a flight oversupply, not a flawed business model, pointing to Frontier's significantly lower operating costs. The public disagreement highlights the intense competition and strategic differences among U.S. carriers as they vie for market share in a challenging environment.</p>

This decline is also influenced by falling yields on 10-year Treasury notes, creating a favorable environment for borrowers. The lower rates have already led to a surge in both new mortgage applications and refinancing activity, providing a new opportunity for homebuyers and existing homeowners who had been sidelined by higher borrowing costs.
