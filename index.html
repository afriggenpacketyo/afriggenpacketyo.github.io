          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to secure enough votes to pass a massive domestic policy bill central to the Trump administration's agenda. The legislation faces opposition from both moderate members and conservative hardliners within the party, who are displeased with changes made by the Senate. Despite pressure from the White House, including direct meetings with the president, key procedural votes were delayed as leadership worked to quell the internal rebellion and prevent the bill's failure. The bill's passage remains uncertain as GOP leaders can only afford a few defections.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Planned Parenthood has warned that a provision in the Republican-led budget bill could be devastating for the organization, potentially leading to the closure of nearly 200 health centers. The bill aims to block healthcare nonprofits that provide abortions from receiving Medicaid funding, which would cost Planned Parenthood an estimated $700 million. This move is being described by supporters and opponents alike as a "backdoor abortion ban" that would primarily affect clinics in blue states and impact over a million patients who rely on the organization for various health services.</p>

The judge highlighted the prosecution's argument that Combs is extremely violent and has shown no remorse. In a notable turn, the judge also pointed to the defense's own closing arguments, where they conceded that Combs had engaged in domestic violence, as a key factor in the decision to keep him detained due to his violent nature.</p>

          <p>The final passage of Donald Trump's major tax and spending bill is in jeopardy due to deep divisions within the Republican party in the House of Representatives. Conservative fiscal hawks, part of the House Freedom Caucus, are outraged by the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit. Simultaneously, moderate Republicans from poorer districts are concerned about the Senate's steeper cuts to social programs like Medicaid, fearing the negative impact on their constituents. These sticking points have created a legislative stalemate, making it difficult for leaders to secure the necessary votes.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is conducting a comprehensive review of its weapons deliveries to allies worldwide, prompted by growing concerns over dwindling US stockpiles of critical munitions like Patriot anti-air missiles. This review has led to a pause in some shipments to Ukraine, as the administration seeks to align military aid with national defense priorities, particularly a strategic shift toward the Indo-Pacific. The move reflects a pragmatic re-evaluation of how and where American military resources are deployed, ensuring the US military remains prepared for any mission.</p>

          <p>According to the Pentagon's chief spokesperson, recent US airstrikes on three of Iran's key nuclear facilities have set back its program by an estimated one to two years. This assessment, based on intelligence collected after the strikes, suggests a more significant degradation of Iran's capabilities than was indicated in initial reports. The new evaluation supports the administration's claims of a successful operation, stating that critical components like centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site were effectively destroyed, significantly delaying Iran's path to developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>British tennis has seen mixed results at Wimbledon, with Katie Boulter experiencing a disappointing second-round exit after letting a lead slip. Her loss contrasts sharply with the success of fellow Briton Sonay Kartal, who is enjoying an impressive run. Kartal, who has risen rapidly in the rankings, defeated a seeded opponent in the first round and powered through her second match to reach the third round of the tournament for the first time, thriving on the big stage and showcasing her growing confidence and maturity.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic courtroom scene, Sean 'Diddy' Combs fell to his knees and buried his head in a chair as a jury acquitted him of the most severe charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. While he was found guilty on lesser prostitution-related charges, the acquittal on the major counts prompted an emotional outburst and small celebrations from his family. After the verdict, Combs made a prayer sign to the jury and appeared to mouth "I'm coming home" to his family, though his subsequent request for bail was denied.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from a public safety advocate argues that Los Angeles needs to adopt a new, technology-driven strategy to combat the rampant use of illegal fireworks. The author points to the significant risks of fires, injuries, and pollution, noting that current enforcement and education efforts have been insufficient. The article proposes that the city should follow the example of Riverside by using surveillance drones to capture violations in real-time and mail citations to offenders, thereby increasing deterrence without straining emergency responders.</p>

          <h2>Column: Republican Budget Bill and Lavish Bezos Wedding Symbolize a New Gilded Age</h2>

          <p>This opinion column draws a parallel between the Republican party's "One Big Beautiful Bill" and Jeff Bezos's extravagant $50-million wedding in Venice, arguing both are stark symbols of a new Gilded Age. The author contends that the legislation, which offers massive tax cuts for the wealthy while slashing healthcare and nutrition programs for the poor, exacerbates record income inequality. The piece frames these two disparate events as a combined exhibit of excess that showcases the widening gulf between the ultra-rich and ordinary citizens.</p>
