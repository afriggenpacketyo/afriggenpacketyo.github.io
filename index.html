          <p>President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order to create national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This follows the NCAA's 2021 rule change that allowed student-athletes to earn significant income from endorsements and other deals, which has reshaped college sports. The move comes as Congress considers the "SCORE Act," a bill aimed at superseding inconsistent state laws, though some worry it gives the NCAA too much power. This executive action seeks to bring federal oversight to the lucrative and often chaotic new landscape of collegiate athlete compensation.</p>

          <p>The nomination of self-proclaimed Democratic socialist Zorhan Mamdani for New York City mayor is causing a significant rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats fear his progressive platform could alienate voters in crucial swing districts, potentially jeopardizing their chances of retaking the House. Republicans are capitalizing on the division, portraying the party as increasingly radical. While some Democrats see an opportunity to learn from Mamdani's successful digital campaign strategies, key party leaders have so far withheld their endorsements, highlighting the internal struggle over the party's direction.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which would establish a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports to the United States. In exchange, the U.S. would gain tariff-free access to Indonesian markets, a significant shift from previous trade relations. As part of the agreement, Trump stated that Indonesia has also committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft. However, the Indonesian government has not yet officially confirmed these specific terms, creating some uncertainty around the final details of the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have narrowly advanced a bill, at President Trump's request, to rescind approximately $9 billion in previously approved federal spending. The measure, which passed a key procedural vote with Vice President JD Vance breaking a tie, targets foreign aid programs and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Despite concerns from some Republicans about the impact on public media and humanitarian programs, the majority supported the move as a step toward fiscal control. Democrats have strongly opposed the bill, arguing it undermines the bipartisan appropriations process and harms vital services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of individuals with serious criminal convictions to the African nation of Eswatini, even though it is not their country of origin. The deportees, originally from countries like Cuba, Jamaica, and Vietnam, had been convicted of violent crimes including murder and sexual assault against a child. This action is part of a broader, controversial policy to send deportees to third-party countries when their home nations refuse to accept them. The practice has drawn criticism from human rights advocates over safety concerns and the legal process afforded to the individuals being removed.</p>

Sources believe this conflict is a pretext for President Trump to install a more aligned CEO and potentially advance a long-held goal of privatizing the TVA.

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. According to the World Gold Council, this approach is often cheaper and helps support the domestic mining industry. Countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines are using this method to build up their gold holdings amid surging prices and global geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed the unpredictable nature of the stock market during corporate earnings season, highlighting recent movements of several major companies. He noted the positive surge in Nvidia's stock after the White House clarified its China trade policy, allowing the company to sell chips there. Conversely, he expressed disappointment with the market's negative reaction to earnings reports from BlackRock and Wells Fargo, which saw their stocks fall despite some strong indicators. Cramer's analysis underscores the difficulty of predicting investor reactions even with seemingly positive or negative news. (not investment advice)</p>

Torres was convicted in 2001 based on shaky witness testimony, despite having an alibi and a cast on his arm that made firing a gun unlikely. His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022. The settlement provides restitution for the immense harm caused by his wrongful incarceration.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education, an expert from a conservative think tank weighed in on the impacts. Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, noted that offices for Financial Aid and Civil Rights have seen the most significant cuts. However, he argued that most students and teachers are unlikely to feel a direct impact, as education is primarily managed at the state and local levels. Petrilli believes the department will still exist, albeit smaller, at the end of the administration.</p>

The tree was a beloved landmark and a place of personal significance for many, including King, who described it as a "sentinel of time." His visit, filmed for a BBC documentary, captures the profound sense of loss felt by the community over the destruction of the iconic tree.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants." The goal is to avoid patient confusion and clarify their role, as they are not doctors. The review, prompted by safety concerns and cases where patients died after being treated by PAs, also suggests they should not diagnose patients and must wear standardized uniforms to be easily distinguishable from doctors. The recommendations aim to provide a clearer framework for these roles within healthcare teams.</p>

The 175-year-old Victorian glasshouse, which houses a tropical rainforest collection, requires extensive repairs to its rusting ironwork and will have all 16,000 panes of glass replaced. The project also aims to make the building net-zero by replacing gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The complex undertaking will involve carefully relocating over 1,300 precious plants, including a 250-year-old cycad that predates the Palm House itself.</p>

Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family argues he acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, not to seize power. The case is re-examining whether his conviction was just, especially since it was conducted under a military court after another general had seized power. The retrial forces South Korea to confront a pivotal and polarizing moment in its history, re-evaluating the legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>

Trump cited a Fannie Mae memo which noted a "possible occupancy misrepresentation" but did not accuse Schiff of fraud. A spokesperson for Schiff stated that the senator has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and Maryland and has followed all laws.</p>

The news coincides with the EU failing to agree on a new sanctions package against Russia and the resignation of Ukraine's Prime Minister.
