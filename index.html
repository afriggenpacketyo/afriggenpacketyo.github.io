          <p>Shares of Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13%, marking their best performance in five years and hitting a new record high. This significant stock increase followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, which far exceeded analyst expectations. The positive results were largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, marking their best performance since 2021 and a strong recovery from losses in the previous year. The gains were attributed to investments in companies like Grab Holdings and the anticipation of upcoming IPOs for portfolio companies such as Lenskart and Klarna. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan proposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to occupy Gaza City, signaling a major expansion of military operations. The decision, made after a lengthy 10-hour meeting, outlines a strategy to defeat Hamas, disarm the group, and establish a new civil administration in the Gaza Strip. The move has drawn international condemnation amid a worsening humanitarian crisis and criticism from the Hostage Families Forum, who fear for the safety of remaining hostages. Hamas has condemned the plan, stating it reveals Israel's true intention to prolong the conflict rather than seek a ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>A man in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, fatally shot his 57-year-old female neighbor before ambushing two responding state troopers, leaving them with serious injuries. The suspect, identified as 61-year-old Carmine Faino, used a rifle to fire dozens of rounds at the officers and an EMT vehicle before being shot and killed by a police special response team. The two wounded troopers, Joseph Perechinsky and William Jenkins, were airlifted to hospitals and are reported to be in stable condition. Officials described the incident as a calculated ambush, and an investigation into the shooter's motive is currently underway.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new amount, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who collaborates with cartels to bring fentanyl-laced cocaine into the United States. This move escalates pressure on Maduro, who was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020 during Trump's first term. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased bounty as a "pathetic" and desperate political propaganda effort by the U.S. government.</p>

The operation, coordinated by the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," will involve agencies like the FBI and DEA focusing on high-traffic tourist areas and crime hotspots. According to the White House, the initiative aims to make the nation's capital safer for residents, visitors, and lawmakers by cracking down on violent criminals. The executive order also directs a review of pretrial detention policies and maximum enforcement of federal immigration laws in the area.</p>

The game, held at Dignity Health Sports Park, ended in a 2-2 draw during regulation time, with the Rapids initially taking a 2-0 lead before Cruz Azul mounted a comeback. The Mexican team ultimately won the shootout 5-4, finishing their tournament participation with four points. Despite entering the tournament as a favorite, Cruz Azul's performance was considered disappointing, highlighted by a significant earlier loss to the Seattle Sounders.</p>

          <p>The mother of a man who was fatally shot after accidentally opening the wrong car door has called the killer's plea deal a "slap in the face." The incident occurred in December 2022 when 26-year-old Trayvon Dunnaville was shot four times by Dericole Daniel at a gas station. Daniel accepted a plea deal for voluntary manslaughter, resulting in a 25-year sentence where he will serve five years in jail and 20 on probation. The victim's mother expressed outrage at the sentence and the unusual condition allowing the convicted man to self-report to jail by September 2nd.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide injunction, marking the fourth court order to block the Trump administration's policy aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The ruling prevents the government from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The administration argues the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause does not apply in these cases, a position most legal experts dispute. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling that limited nationwide injunctions but left open the possibility for class-action lawsuits, which the Maryland judge certified in this case.</p>

Newsom criticized recent settlements made by Columbia and Brown universities under similar circumstances, which included large payouts and concessions on academic freedom.

          <p>Research published in Science Advances reveals that California's fire season is beginning substantially earlier than it did in the 1990s, a shift attributed primarily to human-caused climate change. In some regions like the Cascade Range, the season now starts 46 days earlier, driven by earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation due to rising temperatures. Researchers ruled out human-ignited fires as the cause, noting a drop in such incidents despite population growth. The study quantifies the anecdotal sense among residents that fire risk is expanding, with some experts noting that the state no longer has a distinct wildfire season but a year-round threat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs on semiconductors and chips are raising concerns about their potential impact on the geopolitical and economic balance in Southeast Asia. Analysts suggest that the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy could create an opening for China to strengthen its influence in the region. The tariffs, announced by President Trump, will exempt only companies with a significant manufacturing presence in the United States, though the specific requirements for this exemption remain unclear. This move adds to existing trade pressures on the region, which is already struggling to adapt to other tariffs implemented under the "America first" policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining dozens of migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new deportation pilot scheme with France. Under the "one in, one out" deal, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept an approved asylum seeker who has not attempted an illegal crossing. The Home Office confirmed that transfers to removal centers are underway, with the first returns to France expected within weeks. The government stated it would robustly defend against any legal challenges, asserting that France is a safe country for asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Instagram's parent company, Meta, is facing user backlash following the launch of a new map feature that shares a user's location with their friends. While the company states the location-sharing tool is an opt-in feature, many users expressed concern and confusion, with some claiming their location was being shared without their explicit consent. Social media users raised alarms about the potential for stalking and other safety risks. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded by stating the company was investigating but believes the confusion arises from users seeing their own location on the map and assuming others can too.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial. Participants lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and diarrhea. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible pill-based treatment available by 2026.</p>

          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to impose stricter geographic restrictions on serious sexual and violent offenders upon their release from prison. The new system would confine offenders to a specific, tailored geographical zone where they are allowed to be, rather than just using exclusion zones they cannot enter. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, the plan aims to give victims greater peace of mind and freedom of movement without fear of encountering their attacker. Critics have raised concerns that the new policy will place additional pressure on an already strained probation service.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders have strongly criticized Republicans after a U.S. senator claimed the FBI would assist in locating Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a GOP-led redistricting effort. The lawmakers broke quorum to prevent a vote on a gerrymandered map that would heavily favor Republicans. Democrats labeled the potential involvement of federal law enforcement as an authoritarian tactic to intimidate political opposition. The controversy is part of a broader, aggressive push by Republicans in several states, including Indiana and Missouri, to redraw congressional maps to their advantage ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing federal agencies to explore rule changes that would permit 401(k) retirement plans to offer investments in alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity. While the order does not enact immediate changes, it initiates a regulatory review process that could significantly broaden investment options for millions of American workers. The move is supported by the private equity and crypto industries, which have long sought access to the trillions of dollars held in retirement accounts. Proponents argue it provides more choice, while critics point to the higher risk and volatility associated with these assets. (not investment advice)</p>

However, earnings per share of $1.86 missed analyst estimates due to the high cost of beef, a key commodity for the steakhouse.

This broke the previous all-time August high of 117 degrees, set most recently in 2023. The record heat is caused by a strong area of high pressure settled over central Arizona, which is also limiting the chances of cooling monsoon showers.

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's ban on the use of "roving patrols" by immigration enforcement agents in Southern California. A federal judge had restricted the tactic, finding that agents were likely violating the 4th Amendment by stopping individuals based on factors like race and location without reasonable suspicion. The administration argues the injunction harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous judicial district. Civil rights groups contend that lifting the ban would effectively authorize open season on Latino residents in the region.</p>
