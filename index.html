        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of Bulgarian nationalists gathered in Sofia and other cities to protest the country's plans to adopt the euro, driven by fears of economic harm and mistrust of institutions. Demonstrators, including members of the pro-Russian Vazrazhdane party, carried flags and banners opposing the currency change, demanding a referendum on the issue. Surveys indicate nearly half of Bulgarians oppose joining the eurozone, influenced by disinformation campaigns stoking fears of increased poverty. President Rumen Radev also opposes the euro, citing concerns about inflation and the impact on vulnerable populations, but parliament rejected his referendum proposal, accusing him of pro-Russian sentiment. The current political climate is charged with accusations of foreign influence.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and continuous humanitarian aid. The group's hostage exchange proposal involves releasing 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas's response "completely unacceptable," insisting they agree to the U.S. framework for proximity talks to begin immediately. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction, as the IDF continues operations in Gaza. The situation remains tense as both sides maintain firm stances.</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court decisions have made legal immigrants more vulnerable to deportation. These rulings mark a significant shift for a population that entered the country legally and provided detailed information to the government. The decisions have raised concerns among immigration advocates and legal experts, who argue that they could lead to unjust deportations. The legal community is now grappling with the implications of these decisions for immigrants' rights and due process.</p>

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients in England and Wales are being denied hip and knee replacements to reduce NHS costs, despite NICE guidance stating BMI shouldn't restrict access. Patients are required to lose weight before surgery, but NHS weight loss programs have long waiting lists, leaving many in pain. The Royal College of Surgeons criticizes the policy, warning it could worsen patients' mobility and health. This practice highlights the tension between healthcare needs and budget constraints, with some patients resorting to private surgery.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to be day-to-day and avoid the injured list, though wearing a shoe was difficult. Betts is currently having a down year relative to his career numbers, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs. This injury follows a similar incident where Freddie Freeman missed games after slipping in the shower, adding to the Dodgers' list of unexpected setbacks this season.

          <p>This article provides guidance on delaying Medicare enrollment and its impact on health savings account (HSA) contributions. Delaying Medicare can lead to penalties unless you or your spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, allowing you to opt for employer-provided insurance. Delaying also allows continued HSA contributions, which are disallowed upon Medicare enrollment; in 2025, HSA contribution limits are $4,300 for self-only and $8,550 for family coverage, plus a $1,000 catch-up for those 55 and older.

However, many autism scientists believe Kennedy is misdirected, arguing that genetics are the primary driver of autism's development. Experts say the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, awareness, and screening. Researchers fear Kennedy's focus on toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of promising new therapies. The consensus in the scientific community is that genetics play a significant role.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced school closures and inspections, with lead detected in multiple schools and students testing positive for high lead levels. The city's request for federal support was denied due to layoffs within the CDC's lead exposure team. This leaves Milwaukee to navigate the crisis independently, lacking federal expertise in determining the source of exposure. Local officials express concern over the lack of federal support for emerging health issues, highlighting a potential trend of cities being left to fend for themselves amid emergencies.</p>

          <p>Popular Mexican band Grupo Firme canceled a performance in California after the U.S. government suspended their visas. The State Department has been revoking visas of Mexican musicians playing music that glorifies cartel violence. Grupo Firme said their visas are under "administrative review," preventing them from performing at La Onda Fest. The suspension follows previous sanctions against other Mexican musical groups for glorifying cartel leaders, though Grupo Firme recently announced they would avoid such music in concerts. The situation highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding "narco-corridos" and their impact on both sides of the border.</p>

          <p>The World Food Programme (WFP) reports that crowds of civilians are rushing aid trucks in Gaza, driven by hunger and desperation after weeks of blockade. Seventy-seven trucks loaded with flour were stopped and looted by people trying to feed their families. The WFP says that Gaza's entire population is at "critical risk" of famine, with two million people in "desperate need" of food. The UN has criticized the limited aid reaching Gaza, while Israel accuses the UN of failing to distribute aid already inside. The situation remains dire as Israeli strikes continue and humanitarian efforts struggle to meet the overwhelming needs of the population.</p>

          <p>This article humorously explores the overuse and impact of corporate buzzwords in the workplace. It suggests that jargon, intended to create inclusion, often impedes trust and can make employees feel insecure. Gen Zers, accustomed to instant answers, may find workplace culture and jargon particularly challenging. The piece argues that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and encourages real, human communication instead. The author playfully advises readers to replace corporate jargon with poetry.</p>

UK Steel warned that orders could be delayed or canceled, creating uncertainty for shipments already en route. The UK government is engaging with the US to clarify the implications of the tariff announcement. The trade group is pressing the government to finalize an agreement to eliminate UK steel import tax urgently, as the new tariffs are set to take effect on Wednesday.
