            <h2>Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Deportation of Venezuelans Under Wartime Act</h2>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelan detainees under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, granting a reprieve while it considers the legality of the Trump administration's use of the wartime law. The ACLU argued the detainees were not given adequate opportunity to challenge their removal and were being sent to dangerous conditions in El Salvador. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. This decision highlights ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people, including a British couple identified as Elaine and Graeme Winn. The accident occurred when a support cable snapped, causing the cabin to plunge to the ground. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the crash, despite the cable car having passed a safety inspection two weeks prior. Sixteen other passengers were rescued from a second cabin. The Mount Faito cable car has a history of accidents, with a similar incident in 1960 resulting in four fatalities.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the US bond market due to recent volatility, with bond yields rising sharply as investors lose confidence in the US economy amid trade tariff uncertainty. This volatility could impact public spending, household finances, and business borrowing rates. The bond market reaction has been compared to the UK's mini-Budget crisis in 2022, and the Federal Reserve might have to intervene if the sell-off worsens. The higher borrowing rates can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's immigration policies are drawing parallels to the repressive state model in El Salvador under President Nayib Bukele. Bukele's iron-fist approach, including the construction of mega-prisons and the suspension of civil liberties, has been replicated in Trump's policies towards foreigners. This alliance has led to the internationalization of the Bukele method, where authoritarian tactics are used to address social concerns. Trump's strategy involves outsourcing the most egregious parts of his immigration crackdown, potentially placing it beyond the reach of domestic courts.</p>
