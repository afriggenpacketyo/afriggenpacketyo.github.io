            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen defended his involvement in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, emphasizing the importance of due process and constitutional rights, not defending the individual himself. Van Hollen criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case, highlighting that Abrego Garcia was wrongfully detained and deported despite a court order. He also addressed concerns about the optics of his meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, refuting claims of a trap and emphasizing his goal of ensuring Abrego Garcia's well-being. Van Hollen stressed the need to uphold the rule of law and due process for all individuals, regardless of accusations against them. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A leaked draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes a significant overhaul of the U.S. State Department, including cuts to sub-Saharan operations and bureaus focused on climate, refugees, human rights, and gender equality. The reorganization would create four regional bureaus and potentially close embassies in Africa, while also eliminating the Bureau of International Organizations. The order aims to streamline operations and cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but critics argue it represents a rejection of multilateralism and could harm U.S. foreign policy efforts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the report as “fake news,” but other internal documents propose similar changes, including budget cuts and embassy closures.</p>

            <p>Officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have revised the death toll from a recent boat fire, stating that 33 people died, significantly lower than the initially reported 148. The incident occurred on the Congo and Ruki rivers, with the boat believed to be carrying around 400 passengers. The mayor of Mbandaka attributed the discrepancy in numbers to confusion, while police believe cooking on board the vessel ignited the blaze. Boat travel is a common mode of transportation in Congo due to inadequate road infrastructure, but overcrowding and lack of safety measures often lead to accidents.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, acting on an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were preparing to restart removals under the act, which the Trump administration invoked to detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged gang ties. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, claiming the court acted prematurely. The White House maintains the individuals are foreign terrorists. The ACLU had previously sued to block deportations, citing concerns about the migrants' safety in El Salvador's prisons.</p>

            <p>The article questions the reliability of commonly cited economic indicators, such as the "lipstick index" or men's underwear sales, in predicting recessions. It argues that while metrics like consumer sentiment, unemployment, and GDP are often used, they can be contradictory and fail to identify underlying problems. The author suggests focusing on actual data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies, as these provide a more direct view of consumer behavior, capital availability, and employment trends. Recent reports from Walmart, Amazon, Citibank, and Paychex indicate a healthy economy, but the author advises closely monitoring future earnings releases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As retirement nears, protecting savings from market volatility, such as that caused by tariffs, becomes crucial. Financial planners recommend rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance and timeline, potentially shifting to a 60/40 stock/bond allocation. Building cash reserves to cover two years of income can help avoid selling investments during market downturns, mitigating sequence of returns risk. Consider a bond ladder to generate consistent income and reduce interest rate risk. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is set to present its case for a potential breakup of Google in the final phase of a landmark antitrust trial. The government argues that Google illegally stifled competition by paying phone makers and web browsers to set Google as the default search engine. The Justice Department proposes remedies including spinning off the Chrome web browser and potentially selling the Android smartphone operating system. Google maintains that people use its search engine because they want to, not because they have to, and that the proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation.</p>

            <p>The article suggests that China could use the renminbi as a strategic countermeasure in its trade war with the US. Instead of solely relying on reciprocal tariff increases, China could mandate that bilateral trade be settled in renminbi. This would force the US to purchase large amounts of Chinese currency, strengthening the renminbi's exchange rate and challenging the dominance of the US dollar. A stronger renminbi could also attract international capital and encourage global investors to increase their holdings of renminbi assets.</p>

            <p>The conflict between Donald Trump and Harvard University is part of a decades-long conservative effort to control American academia, dating back to Ronald Reagan and McCarthyism. The Trump administration froze grants to Harvard after the university refused demands for government control over hiring, admissions, and curriculum. Critics argue this is an assault on higher education and democracy, aiming to undermine independent institutions. The move has sparked concerns about academic freedom and the potential for authoritarian influence in universities.</p>
