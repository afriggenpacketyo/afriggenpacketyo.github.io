          <p>Costco surpassed Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue, demonstrating robust growth in both membership income and e-commerce. The warehouse club is effectively appealing to younger demographics, with nearly half of its new members under 40, which has bolstered its overall revenue. CFO Gary Millerchip noted efforts to mitigate higher tariff costs by diversifying merchandise and introducing Kirkland Signature alternatives. While shares saw a slight dip in extended trading and have underperformed the S&P 500 recently, Costco plans significant expansion with 35 new warehouses in the upcoming fiscal year, indicating confidence in future growth.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has mandated a rare and unusually large gathering of hundreds of senior general officers and admirals at Quantico, Virginia, next week, with its specific purpose undisclosed. This significant event occurs months after Hegseth ordered a 20% reduction in four-star ranks and removed 15 senior military officers, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The meeting's unprecedented size and the administration's ongoing efforts to streamline military leadership have fueled widespread speculation among officials about potential further reforms or policy shifts within the Department of War, as it was recently renamed.</p>

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will guide its policy trajectory for the remainder of the decade, amid domestic economic shifts and global uncertainties. Analysts anticipate a strong focus on enhancing the resilience and sophistication of its manufacturing ecosystem, particularly by addressing weak links in high-tech supply chains. While some products, like US-bound iPhones, are assembled elsewhere, their core components often still rely on China's extensive supply network. The plan aims to propel China further up the global value chain, cementing its position as a dominant and self-sufficient manufacturing powerhouse.</p>

          <p>The Prime Minister has drawn a stark comparison between Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's economic proposals and the 'disaster' of Liz Truss's short-lived premiership, highlighting the risks of abandoning fiscal rules. Burnham, who has recently fueled speculation about a leadership challenge by outlining a rival economic vision, including a 50p top income tax rate, faces direct criticism from the Prime Minister. Sir Keir Starmer underscored that economic stability is the government's foundation, asserting that any departure from fiscal prudence, whether for tax cuts or increased spending, would be equally disastrous for working people.</p>

          <h2>Shale Oil Executives Express Alarm Over Trump Policies Hurting Investment and Industry Outlook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 17:57:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shale oil executives anonymously surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas report that President Donald Trump's policies are significantly hindering investment in the U.S. oil patch. They cite concerns over Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and policy uncertainty, which have led nearly 80% of executives to delay investment decisions. Despite the administration's claims of rolling back regulations, most executives see minimal cost reductions, with some warning of the 'twilight of shale' and a 'broken' business environment. The article also notes fears that attacks on renewables could boomerang against traditional energy under future administrations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a groundbreaking $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action copyright lawsuit against AI startup Anthropic, brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally utilized books from pirated databases to train its AI systems. This historic agreement, which includes compensation of approximately $3,000 per book and the mandated destruction of the infringing datasets, represents the largest publicly reported copyright recovery to date. The settlement establishes a significant precedent for AI companies concerning intellectual property, allowing Anthropic to concentrate on developing safe AI systems.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has formally approved a deal for a consortium of US investors, including Oracle and Rupert Murdoch, to take control of TikTok's US operations, thereby preventing a ban. This agreement, valued at $14 billion, ensures that American investors will control the app's crucial algorithm and hold a majority of board seats, with ByteDance retaining less than 20% ownership. The divestiture aims to alleviate national security concerns about potential Chinese government access to user data and influence over content. The new US entity will retrain its algorithm on American user data, with security partners overseeing updates and data flows, ensuring continued operation for 170 million US users.</p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly signaling readiness for direct, limited conflict with Russia, marking a significant shift from previous strategies aimed at containing the Ukraine war. This heightened alert follows a series of escalating Russian incursions into NATO airspace, including 21 drones in Poland and three manned fighter jets violating Estonian territory. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski explicitly warned Russia that any further unauthorized aircraft would be shot down, a position unexpectedly endorsed by President Donald Trump. These provocations, which also include drone sightings near Danish and Norwegian airports, underscore a growing consensus within NATO that the risks of inaction now outweigh the dangers of a forceful response.</p>

          <p>Amazon has reached a significant $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, resolving allegations that the company used deceptive practices to enroll customers in its Prime membership and obstructed their attempts to cancel. The agreement, finalized early in a federal trial, comprises a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds for approximately 35 million customers affected by unwanted enrollments or deferred cancellations. Although Amazon maintains it committed no wrongdoing, the settlement mandates clear disclosures during Prime enrollment and a simplified cancellation process, many aspects of which the company asserts were already in place. This substantial penalty is among the largest imposed by the FTC, though Amazon still faces a broader antitrust lawsuit in 2027.</p>

          <p>Federal officials confirmed that the suspect in the Dallas ICE facility shooting, Joshua Jahn, acted alone and specifically targeted ICE agents, motivated by a strong animus toward the agency. Notes found at Jahn's residence detailed a 'game plan' to maximize lethality against ICE personnel, though not detainees. Jahn, who legally purchased his rifle last month, used a ladder to position himself on a rooftop before firing, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others in a targeted van. Authorities also revealed Jahn utilized apps to track ICE agents, with officials condemning 'wild rhetoric' for fueling increased assaults on law enforcement.</p>

          <p>U.S. new car sales are experiencing an unexpected boost, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 forecast to 16.1 million units, up from previous estimates. This surge is attributed to consumers accelerating purchases due to fears of impending tariffs and higher prices, particularly following President Trump's tariff announcements and the upcoming expiration of EV tax credits. While this 'pull-ahead' demand has benefited the auto industry, analysts predict a slowdown in sales for the fourth quarter and into next year. General Motors, Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford have gained market share, while smaller brands like Nissan and Tesla have seen declines. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge's decision requires Lauren to abstain from firearms, drugs, and alcohol, and attend therapy for two years, after which all charges will be dismissed.
