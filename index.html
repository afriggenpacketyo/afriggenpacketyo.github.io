          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The shrine honors not only millions of war dead but also wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, leading to ongoing diplomatic friction with China and South Korea. Despite the controversy, the cross-party group regularly visits the shrine during major festivals and anniversaries, reflecting differing views on historical remembrance and national identity within Japan. The visit occurred shortly after Prime Minister Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the shrine, signaling continued sensitivity around Japan's wartime legacy.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's renewed attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he labeled a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates preemptively. Trump's comments intensified existing market turmoil driven by concerns over his tariff policies and fears of an economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all saw significant losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022, and gold prices surged as investors sought safe-haven assets. This ongoing conflict between the president and the Fed chair is exacerbating market instability and uncertainty about the U.S. economic outlook.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge the freeze of over $2.2 billion in federal grants, following the university's refusal to comply with demands to limit campus activism. The Trump administration had called for changes to Harvard's governance, admissions policies, and diversity initiatives, citing concerns about antisemitism and ideological balance. Harvard President Alan Garber argued that the funding freeze is arbitrary and violates the university's First Amendment rights, asserting that the government cannot connect antisemitism concerns to vital medical and scientific research. The lawsuit underscores the growing tension between the administration and universities over academic freedom and political influence.</p>

          <p>The new U.S. Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, conveyed a positive outlook on the ongoing tariff negotiations between the United States and Japan, anticipating a second round of discussions later in the month. During a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Glass emphasized the strong economic and friendly relationship between the two countries. Despite existing trade tensions stemming from the Trump administration's protectionist policies, both sides expressed a commitment to strengthening their alliance and enhancing cooperation, particularly in addressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The discussions also touched on reducing the burden on local communities hosting U.S. military bases in Japan.</p>

          <p>The family of James Lee Williams, known as The Vivienne, has revealed that they only learned about his struggle with ketamine addiction after his death from cardiac arrest caused by the drug. His sister, Chanel Williams, is now campaigning to raise awareness about substance abuse and reduce the stigma that prevented him from seeking help. The Vivienne had previously spoken openly about addiction on Drag Race UK, but Chanel believes his success made it difficult for him to admit he was struggling again. The family is also advocating for the reclassification of ketamine as a Class A drug to better reflect its dangers and encourage open conversations about addiction.</p>

          <p>The UK government will begin publishing data on the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the country, a move the Conservatives claim is a result of their pressure on the Labour government. Official data indicates a rise in the number of foreign offenders awaiting deportation, despite an increase in actual deportations. Home Office sources attribute the increase to early releases due to prison overcrowding, difficulties in deporting individuals to unstable countries, and appeals based on human rights grounds. The published data is expected to show that Albanians, Romanians, and Poles are among the top nationalities of foreign criminals, with common offenses including drug production, theft, and violent assault.</p>

          <p>The declining value of the U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, presenting both opportunities and challenges. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation by making imports cheaper, it also complicates export competitiveness, especially in Asia. Some central banks may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but this carries risks such as capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. administration. The European Central Bank has already cut rates, taking advantage of declining inflation, while others are proceeding cautiously to avoid instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Zizz has been charged with the murder of 82-year-old Marcia Norman, whose remains were found buried under a shed he allegedly built. Norman disappeared from her residence in Washington state in early April, and Zizz, who was her handyman, was the last known person to see her. Authorities discovered Norman's remains after finding inconsistencies in Zizz's statements and executing search warrants. The autopsy revealed that Norman died from blunt force and sharp force injuries to the head.</p>
