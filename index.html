          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and the first African woman chosen to curate the Venice Biennale, has died at the age of 57 in Switzerland, just before she was scheduled to announce the theme of the event. Kouoh was known for her work as the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, where she championed artists of color from Africa and beyond, staging several acclaimed shows that gained international recognition. Colleagues remember her as a mentor, a visionary, and a champion of underrepresented voices in the art world, emphasizing her unique ability to connect with artists and create exhibitions with ethical grounding. Her death leaves a significant void in the contemporary art community, as she was highly anticipated to bring a fresh perspective to the Venice Biennale.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are holding critical trade negotiations in Geneva aimed at de-escalating tensions stemming from the ongoing trade war. The talks have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. While Trump has hinted at lowering tariffs to 80 percent, the U.S. insists on concessions from China, accusing them of unfair trade practices and failing to curb fentanyl exports. Economists remain skeptical about a quick resolution, cautioning that even with reduced tariffs, import rates would still be substantially higher than before Trump's presidency.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful. She emphasizes that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. Ross points out that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems, a holdover from the past, and encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections. She suggests that mothers should cut themselves some slack and recognize that being good enough is already a success.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership believed Han had a better chance of winning the elections, but PPP members voted against the motion to switch candidates. This decision follows a period of turmoil within the PPP since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol.

          <p>Amid threats of new sanctions from European leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine to be held in Turkey on May 15, without preconditions. This proposal comes after leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland visited Ukraine and demanded a 30-day cease-fire, threatening further sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if the demand isn't met. While Putin did not directly address the cease-fire proposal, he stated Russia's readiness for serious negotiations aimed at eliminating the root causes of the conflict, with the possibility of reaching new truces. The competing proposals highlight the ongoing efforts to find a path to peace amid the continuing conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has sparked widespread outrage among Iranians, uniting them across political, ideological, and religious divides. The name "Persian Gulf" has been used since at least 550 B.C., and Iranians view it as a core part of their national and cultural identity. Trump's proposal has been condemned by government officials, opposition figures, and the general public, who see it as an insult to Iranian history and civilization.

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is relocating to Canada due to the economic impact of President Trump's trade war and tariffs. Located in a U.S. town accessible only through Canada, the museum has seen a sharp decline in Canadian visitors, leading to unsustainable sales. The owners, Neil and Krystal King, are moving the museum across the border to avoid tariffs and to cater to their loyal Canadian customers who feel alienated by the current political climate. The move highlights the real-world consequences of trade policies on small businesses in border communities.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received and emphasized her faith in the American system of justice, while community leaders celebrated her release and vowed to continue fighting for her exoneration.</p>

The case highlights the importance of taking domestic violence seriously and the lasting impact it can have on victims and their families.

          <p>A new oral medication, zongertinib, has demonstrated promising results in treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a difficult-to-treat form of the disease. According to an international clinical trial involving Chinese and US scientists, zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option while exhibiting a favorable safety profile. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that zongertinib could become a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC, offering a potential alternative to intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, which carries risks of adverse side effects.</p>
