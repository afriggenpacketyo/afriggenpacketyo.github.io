            <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, China has appointed Li Chenggang as the new vice minister of commerce and top representative for international trade negotiations, replacing Wang Shouwen. Li's appointment comes as trade talks between the two economic powerhouses have stalled, signaling a potential shift in China's approach to trade negotiations. This move is part of a broader reshuffle in Beijing's top echelon, which also includes the removal of the head of the National Immigration Administration and a vice foreign minister. The change in personnel highlights the growing complexity and importance of navigating the trade relationship between China and the US.</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly restricts access to the president, particularly for wire services like the Associated Press (AP), Reuters and Bloomberg. This policy change follows a court ruling that the White House had improperly punished the AP for its coverage decisions, specifically regarding the naming of the Gulf of Mexico. The new policy gives the press secretary greater control over who can question the president and limits access to small-space events, raising concerns about viewpoint discrimination and government control over the media. The White House Correspondents Association has criticized the policy, emphasizing the importance of an independent media covering the government.</p>

            <p>China's economy expanded by 5.4% in the first quarter, exceeding expectations despite an ongoing trade war with the United States. The GDP figures, released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), indicate a steady recovery momentum. However, concerns remain about achieving the annual growth target of around 5%, particularly with escalating external shocks. The NBS acknowledges the complex external environment and the need to boost domestic demand to sustain economic recovery.</p>

            <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia student and Palestinian activist, was detained by immigration agents just before his citizenship interview, fearing the appointment was a trap. Mahdawi's attorneys claim he is being punished for protected speech and is being detained under a law allowing deportation for those posing "serious adverse foreign policy consequences." This detention follows a similar case involving fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil. Mahdawi, who co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union, had faced threats and intimidation after speaking about campus protests.</p>

Boeing is scheduled to ship approximately 10 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers.
