          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, China is actively pursuing a diplomatic strategy to strengthen ties with Russia, Southeast Asian nations, and other global stakeholders. Beijing is positioning itself as a defender of the "rules-based, UN-centred" international system, contrasting this with Washington's "America first" approach. Analysts caution that differing world views and national interests could hinder China's vision of a multipolar world. China emphasizes its contributions to the post-World War II international order through its membership in organizations like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a Republican policy bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt. This estimate is likely to intensify the debate within the Republican Party regarding the fiscal consequences of President Trump's agenda. The bill aims to enact President Trump’s policies, but its impact on the national debt is raising concerns. The CBO's findings highlight the challenges of balancing policy goals with fiscal responsibility.</p>

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is reportedly drafting a rule to expand such restrictions, potentially impacting millions of people.

Supporters claim that time limits could spread limited rental aid among more people and encourage upward mobility.</p>
