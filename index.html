          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 02:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the global green energy transition increases the demand for copper, China is strategically investing in African mining operations to secure its supply. This move is partly a response to Western countries, like Canada, restricting Chinese access to their critical mineral assets. Chinese companies are making significant investments in the copper sectors of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana, highlighting the mineral's crucial role in manufacturing EV batteries and solar panels. These actions demonstrate Beijing's proactive approach to resource diplomacy and its long-term planning for energy independence.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer experienced a significant political humiliation after a large-scale rebellion from his own party's MPs forced a major U-turn on his proposed welfare reforms. Despite having a strong majority, the government lost control of the House of Commons, leading to a chaotic parliamentary showdown reminiscent of the Brexit era. The climbdown has reportedly created a substantial hole in public finances and led to widespread anger and frustration within the Labour party. This event has weakened the Prime Minister's authority and raised serious questions about his leadership and the government's stability.</p>

          <p>Paramount has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Trump concerning a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. The settlement funds will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library and legal fees, with no direct payment to Trump or his co-plaintiff. While the agreement includes no apology from Paramount, the company has agreed to release transcripts of future interviews with presidential candidates. The lawsuit was widely criticized by First Amendment scholars as a frivolous attack on press freedom, and its settlement follows the departure of several high-level CBS executives.</p>

          <p>The number of current and former UK armed forces aircrew taking legal action against the Ministry of Defence (MoD) over cancer diagnoses has reached at least 180. The personnel claim their illnesses, including rare blood cancers, were caused by exposure to toxic fumes from helicopters like the Sea King and Puma. While the MoD has settled some cases out of court without admitting liability, it maintains that engine emissions pose no health risk but is conducting further tests. Veterans' groups and politicians are urging the MoD to implement a cancer screening program and increase awareness for those potentially affected.</p>

          <p>A recent G7 deal that exempts American companies from a previously agreed-upon global minimum tax has drawn sharp criticism for undermining international tax fairness. Authored by prominent economists, this article argues the decision favors multinational corporations over the interests of developing nations and ordinary citizens, who will bear a higher tax burden. This move guts the "Pillar Two" agreement, which was designed to halt the "race to the bottom" in corporate tax rates. The authors contend this exemption makes a mockery of the inclusive global framework and call for the international community to reject the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

The official noted that while China often portrays the relationship as problem-free, the EU's perspective is that substantive changes are needed from Beijing's side.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, well before the previously established deadline of February 2026. The Brooklyn-based judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to vacate a country's TPS designation prematurely. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which currently protects migrants who have built lives in the U.S. based on the program's prior extension.</p>

The decision represents a significant policy shift and a potential blow to Ukraine's war effort.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant change to the company's contract manufacturing business, potentially moving away from a strategy heavily backed by his predecessor. The proposed shift would involve ceasing to market the 18A chipmaking process to external clients due to production delays and a perceived lack of customer interest. Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation 14A process, where it hopes to have a competitive advantage over rival TSMC. This potential pivot, aimed at attracting major customers like Apple and Nvidia, could involve a substantial financial write-off for Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, accompanied by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, toured a new remote migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, which has been nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility, surrounded by treacherous swampland, was rapidly constructed to support the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown and can house up to 3,000 detainees. Trump praised the facility's construction and secure location, suggesting the surrounding alligators serve as unpaid guards. The center is part of a broader strategy to ramp up deportations, which has drawn legal challenges and criticism from advocates who decry it as an inhumane prison camp.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data shows that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border dropped to a historic low in June, with Border Patrol recording just over 6,000 illegal crossings. This continues a significant lull in migration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced enforcement measures. For the second consecutive month, no migrants were released into the U.S. after being apprehended. These figures stand in stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, reflecting a dramatic shift in border management and immigration control.</p>

Musk criticized the president's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," arguing it would dangerously increase the national debt and harm the renewable energy sector by cutting EV tax credits. Trump responded with a thinly veiled threat about the government contracts and subsidies that Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, rely on. This political clash adds a layer of uncertainty for Tesla, as regulatory credits represent a significant portion of its net income. (not investment advice)</p>

However, it also proposes restrictions on Medicaid and has been criticized, notably by former ally Elon Musk, for potentially adding trillions to the national debt.
