          <p>The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is targeting 2035 for the maiden commercial flight of its C929 widebody passenger jet, according to sources familiar with discussions at the Paris Air Show. This timeline is longer than previous estimates but aligns with the development timelines of widebody aircraft by Boeing and Airbus. Comac anticipates the C929, similar in design to the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, will be certified in China by 2032 and the C929 will carry up to 440 people and have a maximum range of 12,000km. Comac's first narrowbody jet, the C919, began commercial operation in China in May 2023, following its certification in September 2022.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has caused a spike in shipping insurance costs in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for journeys into the Gulf, up from 0.125% before Israel's recent attack on Iran. War risk insurance rates have also increased for the Red Sea, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. The reassessment of shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment in the Middle East, raising concerns about a broader conflict and potential U.S. intervention.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is navigating a delicate situation regarding U.S. tariffs ahead of a crucial national election. Ishiba aims to protect Japan's national interests, particularly the auto sector, while avoiding the perception of yielding to President Trump's "America First" agenda. During a meeting with Trump, Ishiba emphasized protecting each other's national interests, but gaps over auto tariffs prevented a deal. Japan is urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy, as higher levies on U.S.-bound automobiles would significantly impact Japanese automakers.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive Eiji Hashimoto stated that the U.S. government's role in its $14.1 billion buyout of United States Steel Corp. will not impede U.S. Steel's business. Despite concerns about potential restrictions, Hashimoto believes the investment and golden share issued to the U.S. government are rational. He emphasized that the deal ensures profitability and benefits both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, with the U.S. government expecting the company to maintain and expand production capacity with aggressive investment.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in central London, piecing together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster. The frescoes, found in Southwark, reveal beautifully painted details of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, offering insights into the affluence of the area during Roman times. The art suggests the presence of highly skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire to fulfill commissions during a building boom in London. The discovery provides more information about the city's expansion and the lives of its wealthy residents.</p>

New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship and will remain paused until the Cook Islands addresses New Zealand's concerns.

          <p>The idea of regime change in Iran is appealing, given the regime's repressive nature and support for terrorism, but history suggests it is a complex and challenging endeavor. While the removal of the regime could address international threats and promote regional stability, the aftermath could lead to instability and prolonged conflict. The lack of a clear successor and the potential for ethnic and religious tensions raise concerns about the long-term consequences of regime change. Caution is warranted, as regime destruction does not guarantee successful regime change.</p>
