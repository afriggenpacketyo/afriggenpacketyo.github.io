          <p>US Secretary of State Rubio indicated a potential for a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of an upcoming ASEAN summit. This would be their first in-person meeting since Rubio took office and could include discussions about the Ukraine war, where the US believes China has been supportive of Russia. Rubio, known for his hawkish stance on China, has been sanctioned by Beijing, adding a layer of complexity to any potential diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily halting President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of parents in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. The judge certified a class action lawsuit representing all children who would be affected by the order, stating that its implementation would cause irreparable harm. The White House criticized the ruling, vowing to fight what it called an attempt by a "rogue district court judge" to impede the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that his country will respond with "reciprocity" to the Trump administration's new 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. President Trump announced the tariff, effective August 1, as a punitive measure related to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and what he falsely claimed was an "unfair trade relationship." Da Silva refuted Trump's claims of a trade deficit, citing U.S. government data showing a surplus, and asserted that Brazil's sovereign institutions will not be dictated to.</p>

          <p>The Coney Beach Amusement Park, a seaside funfair in Porthcawl, Wales, that has operated for over a century, will close its doors in October. The owners announced the closure, calling it the "end of an era" for the families who have run the park and the generations of visitors who enjoyed it. The closure precedes a major waterfront redevelopment plan that includes new homes, shops, and restaurants. Local business owners expressed sadness, noting the funfair was a major driver of tourism and its loss will significantly impact the town.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential earnings of a $20,000 deposit in either a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account. While money market accounts offer check-writing features and high rates, those rates are variable. CDs offer a fixed rate for their term, providing guaranteed returns. Calculations show that in most short-term scenarios (3, 6, and 12 months), a CD currently earns slightly more interest than a money market account, though the latter offers more liquidity. The choice depends on a saver's need for guaranteed returns versus flexible access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing negotiations, a ceasefire deal in the Israel-Hamas war remains elusive as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu concludes meetings in Washington. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations in Gaza continue, with a recent strike outside a health clinic in Deir al-Balah reportedly killing 15 civilians, mostly women and children, who were waiting for aid. The U.S.-based charity running the clinic called the attack a blatant violation of international law. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" and that it was investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its aerial warfare against Ukraine, launching vast, coordinated waves of hundreds of drones and missiles, causing widespread fear and eroding civilian morale. These attacks, using modified and more deadly Shahed drones, are overwhelming Ukraine's air defenses and bringing destruction to cities far from the front lines. Experts warn that with Russian production ramping up, Ukraine is in danger of being overwhelmed. The strategy illustrates a war of resources, forcing Ukraine to expend precious air defense munitions and constantly appeal for more support.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to temporarily lead NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, Jared Isaacman. The president cited Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and his professional ties to Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has major NASA contracts, as reasons for pulling the nomination. The move comes amid a public feud between Trump and Musk. Duffy, who will serve in a dual-hatted role, takes over the space agency as it pursues ambitious goals of returning astronauts to the moon and Mars.</p>

Varda has already successfully launched missions and returned a capsule containing the drug Ritonavir, becoming the first company to process materials outside the International Space Station. The new capital will be used to increase its flight cadence and expand its pharmaceutical lab capabilities.</p>

For WK Kellogg, which spun off from the larger Kellanova snack company in 2023, the deal provides greater resources to grow its brands.</p>

          <p>A former Kerr County IT director alleges that a critical emergency alert warning residents of rising floodwaters was delayed because dispatchers needed supervisor approval. Recordings of emergency radio traffic from the morning of the flood appear to confirm a firefighter's request to send a CodeRED alert was met with a delay. While the National Weather Service issued multiple warnings, many residents say they received no local alerts. This raises serious questions about the county's emergency response procedures during the initial, critical hours of the disaster that claimed over 100 lives.</p>

          <p>A new non-opioid painkiller called Journavx, the first of its kind in over 20 years, is offering hope but also frustration for pain patients. The FDA has approved the drug only for short-term acute pain, such as post-surgery, based on its clinical trials. This narrow approval, combined with its high cost and limited insurance coverage, means many chronic pain sufferers who could potentially benefit are unable to access it. The situation highlights the challenges of bringing new, potentially safer pain management alternatives to the market and getting them covered for broader patient populations.</p>

The piece suggests the nomination is a tactic to maintain power, avoid a corruption trial, and continue a brutal military campaign, all while appealing to Trump's ego and sense of grievance.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the growing phenomenon of intense fan loyalty toward certain grocery store chains like Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and H-E-B. This brand fanaticism is viewed as part of a broader cultural shift where consumption has replaced more traditional markers of identity and community, such as religion or civic affiliation. Anthropologists and neuroscientists suggest that these stores effectively tap into tribal instincts, allowing shoppers to signal their values and connect with like-minded people. Shopping at a particular store becomes a statement about who you are, from regional pride to health priorities.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the devastating Texas floods, false claims blaming the disaster on weather modification have circulated widely online, despite experts stating there is "zero evidence" to support them. A small cloud seeding operation did occur 150 miles away two days before the flood, but meteorologists confirm it was not powerful enough to create or contribute to the catastrophe. The deluge was caused by a natural convergence of storms in a region known as "Flash Flood Alley." This incident is the latest example of conspiracy theories spiking after a major weather event.</p>
