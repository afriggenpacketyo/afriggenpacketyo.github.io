          <p>A federal appeals court is currently hearing arguments that could determine the fate of President Trump's global tariff regime. The case centers on whether the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the widespread tariffs. Opponents argue that Congress, not the president, holds the power to set tariffs, a constitutional principle dating back to the nation's founding. The administration is defending the tariffs as a necessary tool to protect the country and rebalance trade relationships.</p>

          <p>Former MMA fighter Conor McGregor has lost his appeal against a civil court ruling that found him liable for sexually assaulting a woman in a Dublin hotel in 2018. McGregor had been ordered to pay £206,000 in damages. His legal team appealed on several procedural grounds, arguing that his "no comment" answers during police interviews should not have been presented to the jury and that a key question on the verdict form was improperly worded. The appeals court rejected these arguments, upholding the original verdict.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's PLA Academy of Military Sciences have published a design for a powerful 10-gigawatt high-power microwave weapon. The concept is based on "superradiance" physics, a technology that promises to generate rapid-fire, sub-nanosecond bursts of energy with unprecedented power and efficiency. According to computer simulations, the system represents a significant leap beyond the limitations of current directed-energy weapon technologies and could have major implications for electronic warfare.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has given birth to a healthy baby boy from an embryo that was cryopreserved for more than 30 years, reportedly setting a new world record. The embryo was created via IVF in 1994 by another woman who, after having her own child, continued to pay for its storage for decades. She ultimately chose to donate the embryo to the couple through a Christian adoption agency that allows donors to select the receiving family.</p>
