          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing shortages, according to CEO Scott Kirby. The FAA stated that equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia are to blame for the delays, with some arriving flights delayed by over three hours. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled plans to revamp the air traffic control system over the next three to four years, as travelers express frustration over the numerous delays and cancellations at Newark, with over 800 delays and 150 cancellations since Tuesday. As a result, other airports in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, and Dallas are also experiencing a ripple effect of delays.</p>

          <p>Kumamoto Prefecture has initiated a two-day bus tour showcasing ten bronze statues of "One Piece" characters to boost tourism and recovery efforts following the 2016 earthquakes. Manga artist Eiichiro Oda, a Kumamoto native, created the statues to inspire locals, with each statue placed in a municipality affected by the disaster. The tour, priced at 28,000 yen, includes visits to a quake memorial museum and a disaster-hit railway, aiming to highlight reconstruction progress. While currently aimed at domestic tourists, the prefecture is considering translation services due to the global popularity of the "One Piece" series.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that nearly 30% of common-law couples in Japan choose not to legally marry due to the requirement to adopt a single surname, a law unique to Japan. Among those in their 20s, this figure rises to 40%, with over 60% expressing willingness to marry if separate surnames were permitted. The survey estimates that approximately 1.22 million people in their 20s to 50s are in common-law relationships, with 587,000 desiring legal marriage under different surname conditions. While the main opposition party supports optional separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the change, citing concerns about traditional family values.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with 12,000 new coffee shops opening in the past year, driven by increased accessibility and price competition. President Xi Jinping's endorsement of domestic Yunnan coffee has further fueled interest in the market. Starbucks' market share has significantly decreased, falling from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, while growth concentrates in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities like Chengdu and Hangzhou.
