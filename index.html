          <p>A prominent Chinese analyst suggests Beijing may build a scientific research lab at the Scarborough Shoal, a territory disputed with the Philippines. The proposed facility would invite international experts for coral reef and fisheries research, aiming to frame China's presence in a scientific context. This move has been condemned by the Philippines as "illegitimate and unlawful," asserting that the shoal lies within its exclusive economic zone. The analyst, Wu Shicun, presented the plan as a way to explain and justify Beijing's intentions in the contested South China Sea waters.</p>

He asserts that while early plans had mixed success, the strategy since China's reform and opening-up has consistently aimed to build a robust national economy and improve citizen prosperity.

          <p>A 64-year-old man is in FBI custody after allegedly firing multiple rounds at the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. The incident, classified as a drive-by shooting, resulted in damage to a window but caused no injuries. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, was initially arrested by local police and released on bail before being re-arrested by the FBI on federal charges of interfering with a communications station. The motive remains under investigation, though it occurred amid controversy over ABC's suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following comments about the death of Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>During a memorial service in Glendale, Arizona, speakers emphasized the profound impact of Charlie Kirk's Christian faith on his life and political movement. Lucas Miles of Turning Point USA described the event as a historic gathering for the gospel, stating Kirk died a "Christian martyr." Attendees and faith leaders credited Kirk with making Christianity appealing to younger generations again by defending the faith in the public square. The service, filled with worship music and emotional tributes, was framed not as a political rally but as a Christian memorial celebrating his legacy of inspiring faith.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investor group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, calling them "American patriots." The potential sale is driven by a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns. The White House has suggested a deal is imminent, which would place control of the popular app's data and algorithm in American hands. (not investment advice)</p>

While the airport and government champion the project for its potential to create jobs, it faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate impacts.

The article analyzes Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's unusually defensive tactics, where he shifted to a 5-5-0 formation after taking an early lead. This strategy, which resulted in City's lowest-ever possession statistic under Guardiola, nearly succeeded but was undone at the last moment. The analysis suggests that while City was fatigued from a heavy schedule, both teams ultimately fell short in a match that was more of a "slugfest" than a display of fluid football.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, currently located northeast of the Philippines, has become the most powerful storm of 2025, reaching sustained winds of 270 km/h. This makes it a Category 5-equivalent storm, the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The typhoon's immense strength is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and minimal wind shear. Satellite imagery reveals a well-defined, symmetrical structure characteristic of an extreme storm. Ragasa is expected to maintain its peak intensity before gradually weakening as it moves towards the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Senior Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have warned that President Trump's efforts to target his political opponents are setting the U.S. on a dangerous path toward authoritarianism. Their comments followed Trump's public call for the Justice Department to prosecute his adversaries and the suspension of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel after regulatory pressure from the FCC. Schumer stated that turning the DOJ into an instrument against enemies "is the path to a dictatorship." Senator Chris Murphy added that the country is "quickly turning into a banana republic," citing the use of federal power to silence critical voices.</p>

          <p>Brazilians in all 26 states protested on Sunday against proposed legislation that could grant amnesty to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted for a 2023 coup attempt. The demonstrations were fueled by the passage of a constitutional amendment making it harder to prosecute lawmakers and the fast-tracking of a bill that could pardon those involved in the uprising. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to over 27 years in prison for his role in the plot. Prominent artists and cultural figures, including music legends Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, helped organize the protests against what they see as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>Sharifeh Mohammadi, a 46-year-old Iranian labor rights activist, has been sentenced to death for the third time on charges of "armed rebellion against the state." Her activism, which included membership in a committee for labor organizations, was deemed an "opposition group" by the government. Human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings as a politically motivated trial with serious procedural flaws, noting that she had no connection to armed actions. The case has drawn fierce international criticism from trade unions and rights groups, who are calling for her immediate release and the overturning of the verdict.</p>

          <p>Mandy Damari, the mother of a British-Israeli hostage who was held by Hamas for 15 months, has condemned the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. She accused Prime Minister Keir Starmer of "rewarding" Hamas while hostages remain in captivity and the conflict is ongoing. Damari described the prime minister as being "under a two-state delusion," arguing the timing is inappropriate with Hamas still in power in Gaza. Her daughter, Emily, was released in January after being kidnapped during the October 7th attack, in which she was also shot and injured.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic shift, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have formally recognized a Palestinian state. The coordinated announcement aims to build momentum for a two-state solution and revive hopes for peace in the Middle East. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer clarified the move is not a "reward for Hamas" but rather a step toward a future where the terrorist group has no role. The decision was met with fierce opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established.</p>

          <p>According to sources, the Department of Justice shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," after he was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash in an FBI sting operation. The probe, which began during the Biden administration, reportedly captured Homan agreeing to help undercover agents posing as executives obtain government contracts if Trump won the 2024 election. The investigation was closed in the early days of the Trump administration, raising concerns about the potential politicization of the Justice Department. Top officials confirmed the probe but stated it found "no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing."</p>

In a social media post, Trump stated, "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility," expressing frustration that "nothing is being done." The call was sharply criticized by Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer, who described it as a step toward dictatorship.

          <p>Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director and current IBM vice chair, stated that the U.S. job market has degraded, a view he says is shared by the Federal Reserve. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Cohn pointed to a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 per month to less than 50,000. He explained that companies facing rising input costs are cutting back on labor, their most manageable expense, to protect profit margins. This marks a shift from the post-COVID period of "labor hoarding" to a more aggressive management of human capital expenses across all business sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump seemed to dismiss concerns over new Pentagon restrictions that severely limit journalists' ability to report on military matters. When asked about the directive, Trump stated, "No, I don't think so," in response to whether the Pentagon should control what reporters can cover, adding, "Nothing stops reporters." The memo, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, requires journalists to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release. The policy has been condemned by press freedom advocates as a direct assault on independent journalism and an unconstitutional prior restraint on publication.</p>

After Ireland set a target of 155, a total kept in check by a strong English bowling performance led by Adil Rashid, England's chase was anchored by Jordan Cox. Cox, a late addition to the squad, scored a crucial 55 runs to build the foundation for the win, which was sealed with 17 balls to spare.
