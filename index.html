          <p>Air India Flight 171 crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, killing all 242 people on board and devastating a nearby hostel. The investigation will involve sifting through the wreckage and analyzing the cockpit voice and flight data recorders to determine the cause of the crash. Investigators will consider possibilities such as engine failure due to bird strikes or fuel contamination, improperly extended flaps, or maintenance errors. The focus will be on both the engines and the cockpit recordings to understand what went wrong in the crucial seconds after takeoff. The accident experts will examine the wreckage and the data recorders to build a coherent picture of the events leading to the crash.</p>

          <p>Following campaign promises, the Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement in Southern California, causing fear among undocumented immigrants. ICE operations have become more aggressive, with agents conducting raids in various cities. Despite assurances from Tijuana officials, activists warn of increased power and support for Trump's anti-immigration policies. Raids have been reported at locations like Home Depot parking lots, where day laborers seek work, leading to arrests and community anxiety. This has caused a reduction in the flow of migrants to the United States and a sense of unease for those already living there.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team has indicated they will need less time than initially expected to present their case in his federal trial. This change suggests the defense may have identified weaknesses in the prosecution's case, which relies heavily on testimony from former partners and employees. Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, with a potential sentence of 15 years to life in prison if convicted. The trial has included testimony about alleged sexual assault and drug trafficking. The judge has warned both sides against violating a gag order.</p>

During the test, the escape engines ignited, and the return capsule separated cleanly from the escape tower, landing safely with an airbag system.

          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders launched an action plan to reduce risks in critical mineral supply chains, addressing overdependence on China. The plan focuses on cooperation, monitoring shortages, responding to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, and recycling. The G7 aims to develop standards-based markets for critical minerals and increase investment in responsible projects. While not explicitly naming China, the strategy addresses concerns about its dominance in rare earths and its use of export controls. The leaders emphasized the importance of stable relations with China, urging them to avoid market distortions.</p>

          <p>Exports from Japan experienced a sharp decline of 1.7% year-over-year in May, the largest drop since September 2024, primarily due to a significant decrease in shipments to the U.S. The fall in exports was softer than economists' forecasts but highlighted the ongoing trade uncertainties faced by the country. Exports to the U.S. fell by 11.1%, with automobile exports to the U.S. plummeting by 24.7%. This data comes as the Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth was likely to moderate due to trade factors, including potential tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

This involves building a European pillar within NATO, maximizing the alliance's command structure and defense planning expertise.
