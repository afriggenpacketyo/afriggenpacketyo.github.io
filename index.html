          <p>Defense contractor L3Harris and aviation company Joby are partnering to create a new hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) military aircraft. This craft, based on Joby's S4 model, will feature a gas turbine and can be operated by a pilot or fly autonomously. The collaboration aims to address evolving military needs for faster, cheaper, and more flexible low-altitude aviation, with initial use cases focusing on surveillance and logistics. Testing is scheduled to begin this fall, with operational demonstrations expected in 2026 as the Pentagon increases its focus on autonomous technology.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock dropped approximately 8% despite beating expectations on revenue and profits in its second-quarter earnings report. Investors were concerned by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and cloud revenue growth of 18% for Amazon Web Services, which trailed the growth rates of competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The company also announced increased capital expenditures, potentially up to $118 billion this year, primarily for AI infrastructure, leaving Wall Street questioning when these significant investments will translate into profit. The article notes that Amazon appears to be managing the impact of U.S.-China tariffs better than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay $329 million in damages after finding the company partially liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system that resulted in one death and serious injuries. The incident occurred when the driver, believing the system would brake automatically, became distracted and his Model S accelerated through an intersection, striking two people. The verdict, which includes $200 million in punitive damages, could set a precedent for numerous other lawsuits against Tesla regarding its automated driving technology. Tesla has stated it plans to appeal the verdict, calling it "wrong."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, a career civil servant, following the release of a weak July jobs report. In a social media post, the president made a baseless accusation that the commissioner had "faked" statistics. The report showed the U.S. added only 73,000 jobs in July and included significant downward revisions for May and June, indicating a notable slowdown in hiring. A White House economic adviser attributed the poor performance to uncertainty around tariffs and domestic spending, but expressed optimism for future growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent tariff actions appear to follow a more coherent strategy than his previous moves, using the threat of steep levies to force bilateral trade concessions from other nations. Countries that offer commitments to buy U.S. goods or make investments, like the EU and Japan, face a lower 15% tariff, while others are hit with tariffs of 30% or more to pressure them into negotiations. However, this strategy is fraught with significant legal and economic risks, including a pending appellate court challenge that could invalidate the tariffs and a weak jobs report suggesting the policy may be harming the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club has outlined its decision to refrain from buying stocks amidst the market's downturn, citing three primary concerns. The first is the unexpectedly weak monthly jobs report, particularly the significant downward revisions for previous months, which signals economic trouble. Secondly, the club points to the continued uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of newly implemented tariffs. Finally, the article notes signs of excessive greed and froth in the market, suggesting a correction may be needed before new investments are prudent. (not investment advice)</p>

At age 70, a borrower's Principal Limit Factor (PLF) is around 41%, meaning they could access approximately $496,000 on a home valued at the maximum limit, before fees.

          <p>In a highly unusual event, infielder José Caballero was traded from the Tampa Bay Rays to the New York Yankees during the middle of a game between the two teams. Caballero played the first five and a half innings for the Rays before being pulled from the game and informed of the trade. He was seen saying goodbye to his stunned Rays teammates in the dugout before the deal was finalized. Caballero, who is tied for the MLB lead in stolen bases, expressed his gratitude to the Rays and his excitement to join the Yankees, the team he grew up supporting.</p>

          <p>Economists are signaling that the U.S. labor market has entered a significant slowdown following the release of new federal data. The July jobs report showed a meager addition of only 73,000 jobs, which is below the level needed to keep pace with population growth. More alarmingly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics sharply revised job growth for May and June downward by a combined 258,000, painting a much weaker picture of the economy. Economists attribute the souring market to headwinds from tariffs, reduced federal spending, and immigration policy, leading to stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has ordered two nuclear-capable submarines to be redeployed to "appropriate regions" in response to what he termed "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The move escalates a war of words between the two, which began after Trump issued an ultimatum to Russia regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine. Medvedev had responded by referencing Russia's "Dead Hand" nuclear strike system, prompting Trump's action. The president stated that "words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences," underscoring the rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks fell significantly on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 500 points, as investors reacted to a combination of negative economic news. A weaker-than-expected jobs report, which showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July and revised previous months downward, signaled a hiring slowdown. Compounding the anxiety, the White House unveiled new, high tariffs on dozens of countries, raising concerns about global trade and economic growth. The poor data has increased investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's imposition of high tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctions against Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been condemned by Brazil's president as "unacceptable" interference. The U.S. justified the moves by citing trade imbalances and the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, which the Trump administration calls a "witch hunt." Analysts suggest the actions are politically motivated, tied to the U.S.-China geopolitical conflict and support for Bolsonaro. The move has triggered a nationalist backlash in Brazil and could strengthen President Lula's domestic standing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of UK motorists will be denied compensation for hidden commissions on car loans after a Supreme Court ruling largely sided with finance companies. The court overturned previous rulings that could have led to a massive payout scheme, finding that car dealers did not have a fiduciary duty to put customers' interests above their own. However, the door remains open for compensation for those with "discretionary commission arrangements" (DCAs), which were banned in 2021. The Financial Conduct Authority is still considering a formal redress scheme for DCA cases.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating Credit Card Debt Forgiveness as a Strategy Amidst Federal Reserve's Rate Pause</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 13:39:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the viability of credit card debt forgiveness even as the Federal Reserve continues to pause interest rate hikes. It argues that forgiveness remains a worthwhile option because average credit card APRs are still near record highs of 22%, and any future Fed rate cuts are unlikely to provide substantial relief to consumers. With total U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.18 trillion, the article suggests that for those struggling with high balances, a settlement that reduces the principal owed can be a more effective and immediate solution.
