          <p>A British man, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, remarkably survived an Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India, that killed 241 others. The London-bound Boeing 787 crashed shortly after takeoff, and Ramesh, seated in 11A, escaped the wreckage. His brother expressed relief at his survival but concern for another brother, Ajay, who was also onboard. The plane crashed into accommodations used by doctors, and the cause of the crash is under investigation, and support is being offered to the families of the victims.

DHS blamed Padilla for the altercation, though a brief meeting between Padilla and Noem occurred afterward. </p>

The Trump administration aims to use this rescissions package as a test case for further cuts, though the package represents a small portion of annual federal spending.

          <p>The Air India crash occurred after years of efforts to turn around the airline following financial losses and tragedies under government control. Tata Sons took over Air India in 2022, aiming to modernize operations and the fleet. While the airline had made progress, including redesigning its branding and ordering new planes, the crash has raised concerns. Both Boeing and Air India have committed to supporting those impacted by the tragedy. </p>

          <h2>Trump Signs Laws to Kill California Auto Emission Standards; State Sues</h2>

          <p>President Trump signed legislation seeking to rescind Californiaâ€™s auto emission standards, including a rule that would have barred the sale of new gas-only cars by 2035. Trump criticized Californiaâ€™s regulations as a disaster, but California Attorney General Rob Bonta led a coalition in filing a lawsuit to challenge Trumpâ€™s laws. Bonta argued Congress unlawfully acted to upend Californiaâ€™s emission rules, setting the stage for a legal battle. (not investment advice)</p>
