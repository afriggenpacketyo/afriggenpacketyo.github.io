          <p>A power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, with French authorities investigating possible arson at an electrical substation. The outage affected 160,000 households and disrupted traffic and train service in Cannes. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme d'Or ceremony, would proceed as planned using an independent power supply. The Palme d'Or was awarded to Jafar Panahi's "It Was Just an Accident."</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition causing issues with hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors advised against performing, and Joel is undergoing physical therapy, hoping to return to the stage. NPH occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, and while symptoms can be mistaken for normal aging, it is treatable with surgery to relieve pressure. By going public, Joel aims to raise awareness and help others seek timely medical attention.</p>

          <p>The cost of driving lessons is increasing, creating financial strain for learners, with instructors justifying the prices due to their own rising expenses. Many learners are forced to cut back on lessons, prolonging the learning process, while a backlog in practical tests requires learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills. Some individuals are delaying learning to drive altogether due to the high costs, impacting their ability to access jobs and other opportunities. The Transport Secretary has pledged to reduce driving test waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to prioritize white South African refugees has sparked controversy, leaving other refugees in limbo. While over 100,000 refugees were admitted to the US under President Biden in 2024, Trump has restricted immigration routes, except for Afrikaners, whom he claims face racial discrimination. This has led to accusations of unfairness, as many refugees who have undergone extensive vetting processes are left waiting while Afrikaners are fast-tracked. The situation has also strained relations with South Africa, particularly over claims of a "genocide" against white landowners.</p>

The victims have formed a campaign group to pressure authorities, accusing the government of ignoring a landmark case exposing institutional failures.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio warns that a federal court order blocking deportations to South Sudan is causing "irreparable harm" to U.S. foreign policy. The order, requiring the U.S. government to maintain custody of deportees, has complicated U.S. diplomacy with Libya, South Sudan, and Djibouti. Rubio argues that the order interferes with diplomatic efforts and exacerbates political divisions. The administration has asked the court to reconsider the order, citing concerns about detaining dangerous criminals in a sensitive location.</p>

          <p>Young American men are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches, drawn to a perceived sense of traditional masculinity and a rejection of modern American values. These churches, particularly those within the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), promote traditional gender roles and home-schooling, attracting converts who feel alienated by mainstream culture. Some converts express concerns about negative American views on Russia and embrace the church's stance on issues like contraception and same-*sex* marriage. This trend reflects broader political shifts and a search for identity among men in a rapidly changing society.</p>

Yarberry's information corroborated existing evidence, leading to Worrell's arrest. The Worrells were reportedly having marital issues due to Jon's inappropriate relationship with Yarberry, who later joined him in Costa Rica, where they lived together for years and raised the three Worrell children.</p>

          <p>Jorge Humberto Figueroa, a leader of the Sinaloa cartel with a $1 million U.S. bounty on his head, was killed in a clash with army troops in Mexico. Figueroa, known as "El Perris," was wanted by the DEA for fentanyl trafficking and money laundering. He was one of the masterminds behind a 2019 clash with authorities in Culiacan, during which cartel members fought for the release of Ovidio Guzman, a son of El Chapo. The Sinaloa state is enduring a war between two rival factions that has left some 1,200 people dead since September.</p>

          <p>The government is proposing new rules to take unfinished housing sites away from developers who fail to complete them within agreed timeframes. Developers will be required to commit to delivery schedules before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports to local councils. Those who repeatedly miss targets could lose their land, face penalties, and be denied future permissions. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, while housing charities have welcomed the plans.</p>
