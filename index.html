It provides specific calculations for various CD terms, ranging from three months to three years, showing potential earnings from over $150 to more than $1,800. The text advises that with Federal Reserve rate cuts looming, now may be an opportune time to lock in a high, fixed rate. It also cautions potential savers to ensure they can commit their funds for the full term to avoid early withdrawal penalties, weighing the guaranteed returns against other investment options.

          <p>Two separate sailboat crews required rescue off the Portuguese coast after their vessels were attacked by orcas. These incidents are part of an increasing pattern of confrontations between killer whales and boats in the waters near Spain and Portugal. While no injuries were reported in the recent encounters, one of the tourist vessels may have sunk as a result of the damage sustained. The events highlight a growing and concerning trend of orca interactions with maritime vessels in the region, prompting responses from local search and rescue teams.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary announced that a "framework" deal has been reached with China regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, aiming to prevent a nationwide ban. The agreement, which is subject to final approval by both President Trump and President Xi, is intended to address American national security concerns over data privacy. While details remain sparse, the deal was reportedly achieved after the U.S. used the threat of a ban as leverage in broader trade negotiations. Experts remain cautious, questioning whether the framework will fully resolve key issues.</p>

          <p>The FBI has stated that the suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appeared to have an "obsession" with the conservative commentator. Evidence gathered from Robinson's digital footprint and social media activity indicates he was actively tracking Kirk's public appearances and had familiarized himself with the event location at Utah Valley University. Law enforcement officials are investigating whether anyone else was aware of the potential for an attack beforehand. The new details provide insight into the potential motive behind the assassination as the investigation continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from reporting their earnings every quarter to a semiannual schedule, a change that would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump argued the move would save companies money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, echoing sentiments previously expressed by business leaders like Warren Buffett. While supporters believe it would foster better long-term management, critics argue that less frequent reporting would reduce transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Constance Marten, a British woman from an aristocratic family, and her partner Mark Gordon have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison for the manslaughter of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The court found them guilty of gross negligence after they went on the run to avoid social services, causing the baby's death by living in a tent during freezing winter temperatures. The judge described their actions as "neglect of the gravest and most serious type," noting their focus was on themselves rather than the welfare of their child. The baby's body was later discovered in a shopping bag.</p>

While Nvidia stated it complies with all laws, the move is seen by some analysts as a politically motivated escalation in the ongoing U.S.-China tech and trade disputes.

          <p>Mortgage rates, which have been on a gradual downward trend for much of 2025, could see another drop this week as the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut. Lenders may preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive, meaning borrowers could see better offers even before the official Fed announcement. However, the article cautions that the market is unpredictable and that the lowest advertised rates are typically reserved for borrowers with excellent credit scores. Potential homebuyers are advised to monitor the market closely to take advantage of any favorable changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 14:09:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the most cost-effective options, even before considering government subsidies. Using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, the report shows that renewables are cheaper to produce per megawatt-hour than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operating and fuel costs are extremely low. The article notes that factors like tax incentives and tariffs can further influence costs, but the fundamental economics currently favor wind and solar energy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While annuities are designed for long-term retirement income, holders have several strategic options if they need to access their money sooner. The most straightforward method is to wait for scheduled payments to begin, but partial withdrawals of up to 10% annually are often allowed without surrender charges. Other options include taking a loan against the annuity, surrendering the contract for its cash value, or using a 1035 exchange to move funds to a new contract. Some annuities also have hardship provisions, and as a last resort, future payments can be sold to a third party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's newly released iOS 26 marks a significant software update, introducing a "Liquid Glass" design philosophy and expanding its "Apple Intelligence" features. The review notes that while the design changes are noticeable, they don't represent a complete overhaul, instead focusing on creating a more cohesive user experience across all Apple devices. Key new features include enhanced on-screen AI awareness, live translation capabilities, and improved iMessage functions. While the update is considered a reliable installation for eligible iPhones, the review points out that Siri's performance remains a weak point and battery consumption was an issue during beta testing.</p>

The mission was initiated after Poland invoked NATO's Article 4 for consultations in response to the drone incident, which has heightened tensions across the region.</p>

Investigators identified him as the suspect and linked him to two other similar robberies that occurred in the same district that day.

          <p>The Senate is voting on President Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, to the Federal Reserve Board. The nomination is controversial due to Miran's past writings advocating for less Fed independence and his plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role rather than resigning. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue this arrangement could compromise the central bank's political independence, which is designed to be separate from the administration. Miran's confirmation would place a close Trump ally on the board that sets the nation's monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Urinary retention, the inability to empty the bladder, can be a distressing and sometimes dangerous medical issue affecting both men and women. A urologist explains that causes can range from temporary issues like constipation or side effects from medications (such as decongestants and antihistamines) to more serious underlying conditions. In men, an enlarged prostate is a common culprit, while women may experience issues due to nerve problems or pelvic organ prolapse. The article stresses that while a weak stream is a gradual symptom, the complete inability to urinate accompanied by pain is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the public reaction to Charlie Kirk's assassination, contrasting it with the sense of shared national grief following political killings in the 1960s. The author argues that President Trump and his allies have weaponized Kirk's death to demonize political opponents rather than fostering unity or reaffirming the importance of free speech. The piece criticizes the selective mourning and the use of the tragedy to create a climate of fear, where expressing dissenting views can lead to professional repercussions. The author expresses fear that these divisive responses are dangerously eroding American democracy.</p>

Starmer defended his initial appointment, stating that the due diligence process did not reveal the information that has since come to light.
