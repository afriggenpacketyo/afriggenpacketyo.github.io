          <p>Tensions between President Trump and California Governor Newsom are rising as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement intensify in Los Angeles and spread to other major cities. Mayor Karen Bass issued a curfew for downtown LA following clashes between police and protesters. Trump deployed National Guard and Marines to LA against the wishes of Newsom and Bass, leading to a lawsuit from Newsom who claims the federal government unlawfully overstepped California's authority. The protests and legal battles highlight the deep divisions over immigration policy and federal versus state power.</p>

          <p>Japan holds its position at 118th out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap report, making it the worst-performing nation among the G7 countries. The World Economic Forum report indicates that Japan's low ranking is primarily due to the limited political participation of women, reflected in the small number of female government ministers and the country's history of never having a female prime minister. While there has been some improvement in women's economic participation, Japan still lags behind in female representation in management positions. Globally, the report estimates that achieving full gender parity will take 123 years.</p>

          <p>Following mass immigration raids in Los Angeles, tensions persist across the country as immigration enforcement efforts ramp up.

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has decreased by 16 points since March, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has dropped from 78% to 62%. The decline comes after a public falling out between Musk and President Trump. Despite the drop in favorability, Musk remains popular among Republicans for his role in the Trump administration, though his overall approval rating among all voters remains low.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Spending Review is being viewed as a gamble on patience in an era of impatience, focusing on long-term capital spending while limiting day-to-day spending. The government hopes that these long-term investments will transform the public realm and boost economic potential, but this approach requires patience from an electorate that has been feeling squeezed for years. While the government is seeking to badge this moment as a turning point, the success of this strategy will depend on whether voters are willing to wait for the benefits of these long-term investments.</p>
