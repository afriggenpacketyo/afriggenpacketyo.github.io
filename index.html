          <p>Chinese state media is encouraging the public to revisit Mao Zedong's 1938 essay, "On Protracted War," suggesting it provides valuable insights for navigating the ongoing economic conflict with the United States. The commentary emphasizes maintaining confidence in achieving ultimate victory despite escalating tariff disputes. This call comes after the Trump administration's tariff plan, which has led to retaliatory measures between the two nations. The article highlights the unexpected resilience of the Chinese government and growing international opposition to what it describes as bullying tactics.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars has announced a $1.9 billion cost-cutting initiative due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter. The company, owned by China's Geely Holding, reported a significant drop in both operating profit and revenue, citing reduced wholesale volumes and adverse currency effects. The cost-cutting plan includes reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations, with further details to be released later. Volvo Cars is also sharpening its focus on the U.S. market, exploring ways to optimize its manufacturing footprint to produce cars closer to where they are sold amidst rising tariffs.</p>

          <h2>Carney's Liberal Victory in Canada Fueled by Anti-Trump Sentiment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals secured an unexpected victory in Canada's federal election, largely driven by a backlash against President Trump's tariff threats and comments undermining Canadian sovereignty. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully positioned himself as a leader capable of protecting Canada's economic survival against Trump's agenda. While the Conservatives made significant gains, their focus on domestic issues was overshadowed by concerns over the U.S. relationship. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, particularly in oil-rich provinces, posing a challenge for Carney as he aims to govern for all Canadians and renegotiate economic ties with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The government is considering expanding the sugar tax to include milk-based drinks and non-dairy substitutes, aiming to further reduce sugar consumption and tackle obesity. The proposal also involves reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies. While the original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to concerns about calcium intake, the government now believes the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar. Opponents argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families, while proponents welcome the move as a necessary step to improve children's health.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a 39% jump in first-quarter profit, driven by strong performance in its investment banking division, but increased credit provisions due to geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties in the U.S. The bank's CEO, Christian Sewing, stated that these results put them on track to meet their 2025 targets. Despite the positive results, analysts noted mixed divisional trends and flagged concerns about the bank's provision guidance, which includes a caveat for economic uncertainty.

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, secured a comeback victory in the recent election, largely attributed to President Trump's threats of annexation and tariff policies. Trump's remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state dominated the campaign, influencing voters concerned about Canadian sovereignty. While domestic issues remained important, Trump's intervention appeared to galvanize support for the Liberals, who campaigned on a platform of standing up to the U.S. and seeking broader global partnerships.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a remarkable victory in the Canadian election, largely due to Donald Trump's constant badgering and threats toward Canada. Trump's remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state coincided with a reversal of fortune for the center-left party. Carney focused on the threat posed by Trump, warning that the U.S. wanted Canada's land and resources. While Trump doesn't appear to dislike Carney as much as he did Trudeau, their political and policy interests are likely to continue diverging.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers, Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki, have been released from prison after serving sentences related to national security convictions. They were part of the "Hong Kong 47," a group arrested for participating in an unofficial primary poll in 2020. The charges stemmed from a national security law imposed by Beijing, which critics argue has been used to suppress dissent. The longest sentence in the case was given to Benny Tai, a professor turned activist, who received a 10-year sentence.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower GDP growth and a decline in exports during the first quarter, falling short of the national average. This underperformance is attributed to a high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the ongoing trade war and industrial transition. Some businesses in Shenzhen are facing high costs and insufficient orders, impacting foreign trade and exports. Despite these challenges, the city is preparing for potential tariff increases and working to stimulate domestic demand.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party has won Canada's federal election, leading opposition leader Pierre Poilievre to concede defeat. While it remains unclear whether the Liberals will secure a majority, Carney has stated that Canada will "win this trade war" with the US. He warned that America seeks Canada's land, resources, and water, and that President Trump is trying to break Canada to own it. The election saw the NDP's support plummet, with many supporters shifting to the Liberals due to Trump's tariffs and comments about making Canada a US state.</p>

The project, spearheaded by the Ministry of Natural Resources, aims to expand Beijing’s maritime influence and fill gaps in existing underwater observation systems. Large-scale prototypes have already been built and tested.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 is set to undergo regulation changes in 2026, primarily driven by the desire to attract new engine manufacturers and refine chassis rules. The new regulations retain 1.6-liter V6 turbo hybrids but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo. Electrical capacity will be increased, with about 50% of total power output coming from the electrical part of the engine, and the cars will run on 100% sustainable fuel. These changes have led to Audi's entry and Ford's partnership with Red Bull, while Honda is staying in the sport.</p>
