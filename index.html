            <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered the White House to restore access for Associated Press journalists to presidential events, including the Oval Office and Air Force One, after the news agency was restricted due to a dispute over the use of the term "Gulf of Mexico." The judge found that the White House's actions violated the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, as the AP's exclusion was based on viewpoint discrimination. The ruling emphasizes that while the White House can control access, it cannot exclude journalists based on their editorial decisions or viewpoints. The decision is temporarily stayed to allow the government to seek emergency relief.</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented on the stock market's recent volatility, stating that it is struggling to keep up with President Trump's rapidly changing statements and policies, particularly regarding tariffs. He noted that initial rallies driven by speculation of trade negotiations were quickly reversed by confirmations of new tariffs, leading to significant market swings. Cramer suggests that investors are losing confidence due to the unpredictability and that the market is currently "just plain stupid," needing a slower pace of actions from the White House to regain stability. He also mentioned Apple's stock decline as an example of the market's erratic behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies continue to create confusion and instability in global markets, with conflicting messages about trade negotiations with China. After markets initially rallied on hopes of eased tariffs, the White House confirmed the implementation of additional tariffs on Chinese imports, causing a sharp reversal. Economists warn that these policies risk fueling inflation and triggering a destructive global trade war. Trump's administration defends the tariffs as a means to boost U.S. manufacturing and generate revenue, while critics point to the potential for economic harm.</p>

            <p>The Social Security Administration is implementing new rules requiring applicants for retirement or survivor benefits to apply online or in person, a change that critics say will disproportionately affect millions of seniors and people with disabilities. A report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that this could mean a 45-mile trip for some 6 million seniors. While the SSA claims the changes are intended to combat fraud, advocates argue they create unnecessary barriers for those who lack internet access or have mobility issues, especially bereaved individuals applying for survivor benefits.</p>

            <p>Brandel Chamblee, a GOLF Channel analyst, revealed that covering the Masters Tournament requires adherence to specific etiquette guidelines encouraged by broadcast producers. Certain terms like "fan" and "back nine" are discouraged in favor of more formal alternatives such as "patron" and "second nine." This approach aims to maintain the tradition and reverence associated with Augusta National, contributing to the tournament's unique atmosphere. Chamblee believes that this careful word choice by commentators like Jim Nantz and Verne Lundquist enhances the viewing experience.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Stocks experienced a significant downturn after the Trump administration announced a 104% tariff on goods imported from China, effective Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also declining sharply. This sell-off adds to recent market anxieties over the economic impact of Trump's reciprocal tariffs. The initial rebound earlier in the day, fueled by hopes of tariff negotiations, was quickly reversed by the White House's confirmation of the new levies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, calling him a "moron" for comments made about Tesla. Navarro described Tesla as a "car assembler" rather than a manufacturer, prompting Musk to defend his company on social media. This public disagreement highlights differing views within the Trump administration on trade policy. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the differing opinions but downplayed the conflict as public sparring.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's suggestion that Apple could avoid tariffs by manufacturing iPhones in the U.S., a tech analyst has expressed skepticism, stating that it is unlikely to happen. Laura Martin from Needham believes Apple's costs would skyrocket if it moved production to the U.S., with some estimating the cost of an iPhone would reach $3,500. She also noted that moving the supply chain would take years. The comments come as investors sell off Apple shares due to its manufacturing exposure to China.</p>

            <p>Canada and China are enacting harsh trade retaliation measures in response to President Trump's tariff policies, posing significant challenges for his administration. Canada will impose 25% tariffs on select U.S. car imports, while China vows to "fight to the end" with a 104% tariff on U.S. goods. This has led to market turmoil, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq experiencing rallies that ultimately disappeared by the closing bell. The Trump administration maintains that only direct negotiations can ease these restrictions.</p>

            <p>The State Department is facing criticism for cutting over $1.3 billion in foreign aid, including terminating contracts for food, water, and medicine in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, and Lebanon. Advocates argue that these cuts could amount to a "death sentence for millions" facing extreme hunger. The State Department claims that the majority of funding to the World Food Programme (WFP) remains active but that some programs were terminated due to concerns about funding benefiting terrorist groups and misuse of cash-based assistance.</p>
