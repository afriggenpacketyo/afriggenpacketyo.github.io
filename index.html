          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to Trump, the strikes were successful, with all planes returning safely after dropping a full payload of bombs on the primary site, Fordow, which is buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain. The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically to clarify that the strikes were not intended to initiate regime change, and House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed ahead of the strikes. Iranian state-run media acknowledged the attack on the Fordo nuclear site, reporting that air defenses were activated in response to the strikes.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson endorsed the strikes, calling it a "decisive" action that prevents terrorism, while other members of Congress debated the constitutionality and necessity of the strikes.</p>

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war saw additional strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility, while Iran warned against U.S. intervention. Israel's defense minister claimed the military killed three senior Iranian commanders in targeted attacks, including one linked to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens were lightly wounded by an Iranian missile strike and began assisting with evacuations of Americans from Israel.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a U.S. attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, financial analysts have shared their perspectives. Some analysts anticipate initial market alarm and higher oil prices, while others believe the action could lead to a peace deal by diminishing Iran's leverage. Concerns remain about potential disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz, but some analysts suggest the strike could reassure markets by preventing a prolonged conflict. The consensus among analysts is that this action will impact energy prices and potentially affect inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. Gabbard had testified in March that U.S. intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was developing nuclear weapons, but Trump asserted that Iran was "very close to having" one. The White House indicated that Iran could potentially produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if given the go-ahead.

          <p>Israel's strikes against Iran have damaged nuclear facilities, but the complete destruction of Iran's ability to produce weapons-grade uranium is unlikely without U.S. assistance. The Fordo uranium enrichment site, located deep underground, is a key concern. The U.S. could use the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a 30,000-pound bomb carried by the B-2 Spirit bomber, to destroy the facility. The B-2 Spirit is equipped with stealth technology, allowing it to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets, and is the only aircraft in the Air Force that is equipped to carry and deploy the MOP.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island criticized President Donald Trump's public disagreement with his own Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. Reed suggested that Trump was disavowing his intelligence community for political reasons as he contemplates an attack against Iran. Gabbard had testified that the intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, but Trump asserted that she was "wrong", potentially to justify a military intervention.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a law requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, making it the largest state to impose such a mandate. The bill is expected to face legal challenges from critics who argue it violates the separation of church and state. The law requires public schools to post a 16 x 20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents say the measure infringes on religious freedom.</p>
