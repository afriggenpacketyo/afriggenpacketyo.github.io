          <p>The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Anthony Bernal, a senior aide to former First Lady Jill Biden, compelling him to testify in its investigation into former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. The move comes after Bernal withdrew from a scheduled voluntary interview following former President Trump's decision to waive executive privilege for several ex-Biden staffers. This inquiry, which Democrats criticize as a partisan exercise, aims to scrutinize Biden's cognitive state during his presidency and the use of an autopen for official documents, potentially challenging the validity of executive actions taken during his term.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is facing harsh criticism from opposition lawmakers after a speech in which he compared the nation's democratic progress to forging steel by removing all "impurities." Critics, particularly from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, have condemned the remarks as a veiled threat and an attempt to justify a political purge. These accusations arise as Lai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pushes to recall dozens of KMT legislators, fueling claims that the president is moving toward a more authoritarian style of governance.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop since last October and signaling that government stimulus measures are not yet reviving corporate financial health. This decline comes amid other mixed economic indicators, such as strong retail sales but weaker-than-expected industrial output. While some economists believe this may reduce the urgency for further stimulus, others caution that persistent deflationary pressure and trade tariff impacts could soften growth in the latter half of the year.

          <p>Dr. Allen Frances, the psychiatrist who led the task force for the DSM-IV, has stated that he played a role in the 60-fold increase in autism diagnoses over the past few decades.
