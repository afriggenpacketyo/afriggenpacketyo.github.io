          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty and people. Araghchi condemned the U.S. attacks on the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites as "outrageous" and warned of "everlasting consequences," accusing the U.S. and Israel of undermining recent diplomatic efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed the strikes were a "spectacular military success" that "completely obliterated" Iran's key enrichment facilities, though this claim has not been independently verified, and the IAEA reported no radiation leaks. Araghchi asserted that every member of the UN should be alarmed by this dangerous behavior and Iran is considering its response to the attacks.</p>

The public approval rating for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has declined to 32.5 percent, and there is divided opinion regarding the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's plan to distribute 20,000 yen to alleviate the effects of inflation, with 41.9 percent in support and 54.8 percent against.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR report explores the increasing acceptance of self-managed medication abortion, a method where individuals obtain and use abortion pills without direct doctor supervision. The article highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have prompted doctors and abortion rights advocates to reconsider safe abortion practices outside of clinical settings. Studies have shown that self-managed medication abortion is a safe and effective option, leading organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to support it. However, some clinicians remain concerned about potential political repercussions and increasing restrictions on abortion medication access.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on nuclear sites in Iran, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for Iran to return to the negotiating table. Starmer emphasized the importance of regional stability and described Iran's nuclear program as a grave threat to international security, stating that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. The UK government was informed in advance of the U.S. strikes, but was not involved. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres described the overnight strikes as a dangerous escalation, while Iran's foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi condemned the strikes as outrageous and warned of lasting consequences.</p>

Resource-scarce Japan relies heavily on the Middle East for crude oil, making the situation particularly sensitive for the country.

Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, echoed this sentiment, asserting that Khamenei must go and calling for a free, democratic, and non-nuclear Iran with separation of religion and state and gender equality.</p>

          <p>This Deutsche Welle article discusses the potential consequences of regime change in Iran, drawing on historical examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, where foreign-imposed regime change led to instability and violence. Experts warn that external attempts to topple the Iranian government could violate international law and lead to a power vacuum or further conflict. The article notes the absence of a strong rebel movement within Iran and argues that aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to achieve regime change. Instead, a ground invasion and support from local people would be necessary, which seems unlikely in the current circumstances.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Donald Trump for a bold decision that "will change history." The article explores how the U.S. intervention has altered the course of the conflict, potentially enabling Israel to declare its war aims complete if the nuclear threat has indeed been neutralized. However, the trajectory of the war now depends on Iran's response, with the country's supreme leader having previously vowed to retaliate against the U.S. for any military intervention. The author notes that the B2 bombers have undoubtedly changed the trajectory of the war, but further escalation hinges on Iran and its allies.</p>

          <p>The new Payment Connect service, linking Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS) to mainland China's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS), has launched, enabling users to send money across the border for various transactions. The service allows 17 million FPS registered users to remit up to HK$10,000 per day to 298 million users of the IBPS. The scheme grants Hong Kong residents a new daily remittance quota for the yuan, which is expected to boost the city's status as an international financial center and a trading hub for offshore yuan. The launch saw 2,000 Northbound and 7,400 Southbound transactions just after noon on its first day of operation.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Explore Spleen's Potential in Diabetes Treatment</h2>

          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that advances in cell transplantation into the spleen could transform this organ into a hub for treating diabetes. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, considered a more promising long-term survival site than the liver, could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles. These findings could potentially offer a new approach to managing diabetes, which affects millions worldwide, including over 140 million adults in China.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, who spent two decades in prison for the 2001 murder of her husband Bob, had her conviction overturned after new evidence emerged. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new testing revealed some blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout, stating that she loved her husband. The prosecution's case relied heavily on blood evidence in the bedroom, a bloody syringe, and testimony from Dorotik's sons, but the new evidence cast doubt on the original verdict, leading to the dismissal of charges.</p>

          <p>This Sky News article analyzes President Trump's decision to authorize strikes on Iranian nuclear sites as a major gamble. Trump is betting that the Iranian nuclear facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated" and that Iran will not retaliate effectively against U.S. bases or international shipping. The article suggests that the best-case scenario would be a repeat of the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, where Iran's response was limited. However, the author warns that any successful Iranian attack on a U.S. base could lead to a dangerous escalation. The article also questions whether Trump's supporters will support this dramatic insertion into a new war, given his campaign promises to avoid foreign entanglements.</p>
