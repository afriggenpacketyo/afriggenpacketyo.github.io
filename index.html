        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Transport Secretary has approved plans for a £2.2 billion privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to significantly boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. This project involves moving the current Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, alongside other developments like terminal expansions, projecting an increase in annual flights from 280,000 to approximately 389,000 by the late 2030s. Despite strong opposition from climate campaigners who label it a "disaster," the government underscores its commitment to "get Britain building again" while adhering to climate change commitments. New conditions include stricter noise controls and public transport targets.</p>

          <p>European stocks experienced a slight downturn, with the auto sector notably affected after Porsche announced a cut to its 2025 profitability outlook and delayed new electric car models due to weak demand. Shares of the luxury sportscar manufacturer fell by approximately 6.7%, impacting its largest shareholder, Volkswagen, which also saw a decline of around 5.5%. This market movement occurred as investors simultaneously monitored the Trump administration's new H-1B visa policy, which significantly raised the application fee to $100,000. This abrupt policy change, designed to protect American jobs, has left many companies, particularly in the tech sector, scrambling to assess its implications for recruitment plans, adding to market uncertainty.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has warned Israel against annexing parts of the West Bank, following the UK's decision to recognize Palestinian statehood. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the policy change, alongside Canada, Australia, and Portugal, aiming to revive the prospect of a two-state solution amidst escalating conflict. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the move, calling it a "huge reward to terrorism," a sentiment echoed by the US. However, the UK stressed that Hamas would have no role in a future Palestinian state, asserting the decision is vital for peace, justice, and security in the Middle East.</p>

After dismissing the former CEO in August due to the "dramatic" state of affairs, Schnieder emphasized that German trains must become "more punctual, more secure and cleaner," and the company itself "quicker, leaner, more powerful and economically more productive." Media reports widely indicate that DB regional chief Evelyn Palla will make history as the railway's first female chief executive, signaling a significant and anticipated effort to reform the state-owned conglomerate.</p>

The game excels in maintaining narrative ambiguity, exploring how society and culture influence a character's mental breakdown, and featuring artfully crafted cutscenes and relentless pacing. Despite minor nitpicks about combat scenarios, its strong atmosphere and narrative make it a triumph, solidifying its place as a favorite since "Silent Hill 2."</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents in the Philippines have been evacuated as the nation prepares for Super Typhoon Ragasa, described by regional authorities as potentially "catastrophic." The typhoon, with wind gusts of 230 km/h (143 mph), is expected to make landfall over sparsely populated northern islands before heading towards southern China. The Philippine weather bureau warns of a "high risk of life-threatening storm surge" exceeding 3 meters, widespread flooding, landslides, and damage to infrastructure. Schools and government offices, including in the capital Manila, are closed, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific has canceled 500 flights, indicating severe regional disruption.</p>

          <p>The 45th Ryder Cup is poised for a critical opening session on Friday, with both the US and European teams aiming for a dominant start in the alternate shot foursomes format. US captain Keegan Bradley has chosen this demanding format, where success has historically been a strong indicator of overall outcomes. Europe, with a more experienced team, hopes to replicate their 4-0 lead from the previous tournament in Rome to silence vociferous home fans. The dynamics are further influenced by the US players receiving payment, contrasting with Europe's unified, non-financial motivation. The early exchanges are expected to be intense, potentially determining if the match will be a close contest or another home blowout.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production, rather than demanding complete denuclearization. Lee views a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" and an "interim emergency measure" to curb North Korea's current production of 15-20 additional nuclear weapons annually. He expressed belief in Trump and Kim's mutual trust, hoping for a resumption of talks that broke down in 2019. This pragmatic approach aims to reduce tensions and establish peaceful relations, despite North Korea's vow to never relinquish its weapons and its growing ties with China and Russia.</p>

          <p>An article investigates the complicated relationship between birth control pills and women's libido, highlighting anecdotal experiences of diminished sex drive among users. While the pill offers sexual autonomy, studies suggest around 15% of women report a drop in libido, potentially due to increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) which reduces free testosterone. Some women also experience physical side effects like dryness or emotional swings. However, libido is influenced by multiple factors, and a majority report no change or even an increase due to reduced pregnancy anxiety. Experts note contemporary pills have lower hormone doses and specific formulations, making a universal connection unproven.</p>

Jessica Cowley, 20, is one such patient, now unable to walk or talk after symptoms began at age 10. Previously thought to be rare in the UK, a 2007 study identified a higher prevalence in Wales, linked to "common founders" and an aggressive gene expansion across generations.

          <p>Outdoor clothing brand Arc'teryx has issued an apology and is under investigation by Chinese officials following a controversial fireworks display in Tibet, which sparked public backlash over its potential environmental impact. The 19 September event, designed by artist Cai Guo Qiang as a promotional campaign, drew criticism for contradicting Arc'teryx's conservation-focused image. Critics argued the explosions and smoke could disrupt Tibet's fragile ecosystem and local wildlife. The Canadian firm stated the display was "out of line with Arc'teryx's values," pledging to assess its impact with biodegradable materials, though many online commenters demanded greater responsibility for long-term environmental consequences.</p>

          <p>A new Production Gap Report reveals that countries, particularly the 20 most polluting nations including China and the US, plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than is consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This stark reality contradicts targets set a decade ago under the Paris Agreement, showing an increased near-term production gap since 2023. China is notably driving much of this increase by slowing its coal production reduction. While the report is based on data from the Biden administration, concerns loom over potential Trump administration policies that aim to boost US fossil fuel production, further jeopardizing global climate efforts.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates that US tariffs imposed in August could slash up to one-fifth of Vietnam's exports to the United States, making it the hardest-hit country in Southeast Asia. In a worst-case scenario with high tariff-driven US inflation, Vietnam's US exports could fall by over $25 billion, nearly 20% of its yearly total. Vietnam's August export data already shows a 2% drop to the US, with footwear exports down 5.5%, following a pre-tariff surge. The World Bank has revised down Vietnam's growth forecasts, indicating a significant economic blow, though mitigation efforts like diversification could temper the long-term impact.</p>

          <p>Officials have issued a warning about "Reggie," a dolphin off England's south coast, whose increasingly "boisterous" and potentially dangerous behavior is attributed to human interaction. Previously engaging playfully with swimmers, Reggie recently pushed two women underwater, prompting intervention. Marine Connection experts clarify Reggie isn't malicious but emphasize that human habituation causes dolphins to lose natural wariness, leading to risks for both animals and people. With Reggie growing larger and more powerful, the situation is becoming unsafe. Authorities urge the public to never swim with, touch, feed, or approach dolphins, reinforcing the Marine and Coastal Wildlife Code to prevent harm and protect wildlife well-being.</p>

The article notes that retail sales slowed, industrial output growth eased, and consumer prices fell, reflecting sluggish domestic demand and a worsening real estate slump. The central bank had last trimmed key lending rates in May as part of efforts to shore up the economy, but appears to be cautious about further cuts for now.</p>

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) is investigating, citing a previous failure in 2023.
