          <p>Singer Kelly Clarkson announced the postponement of the opening weekend of her Las Vegas residency just hours before the first show was scheduled to begin. In a social media post, Clarkson explained that intense preparations and rehearsals had taken a toll on her voice and that she needed to rest to avoid serious damage. The last-minute cancellation of the "Studio Sessions" residency at Caesars Palace left many fans, some of whom had traveled internationally for the event, disappointed and facing financial losses. Clarkson expressed that she was "devastated" but needed to ensure the shows would be perfect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Independence Day holiday was marked by widespread violence, including multiple mass shootings in cities like Indianapolis, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In Indianapolis, where at least two people were killed, the police chief expressed frustration over "hundreds of unsupervised kids" downtown. The holiday weekend, historically one of the deadliest in the U.S., also saw fatal accidents, including a man killed by a firework in Massachusetts and two separate boat explosions on lakes in Georgia that resulted in numerous burn injuries. These events underscore a recurring trend of increased violence during summer months.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in southern Gaza, an incident their organization attributed to Hamas. The U.S. State Department and Israeli Prime Minister also condemned the attack. Concurrently, separate Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people in the Gaza Strip, including some in tents near the coast. These events occurred as Palestinians continue to face extreme danger while seeking food and as diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire appear to be advancing, with Hamas giving a "positive" initial response to a new proposal.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly halted a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, citing concerns over low U.S. weapon stockpiles, a claim Democrats assert is baseless. This marks the third time Hegseth has paused aid, with this latest delay affecting critical air defense missiles and munitions needed to counter intensified Russian attacks. Democratic lawmakers, like Representative Adam Smith, insist that official numbers do not show any unusual depletion of U.S. arsenals. The unilateral decision has surprised allies and Ukrainian officials, who described the delay as painful amid ongoing Russian bombardment.</p>

          <p>Facing a seemingly impossible final-day run chase against India, England's cricket team leadership has hinted at a potential shift in their aggressive "Bazball" philosophy. For the first time, assistant coach Marcus Trescothick acknowledged that securing a draw is a viable and considered outcome, a departure from the team's long-standing "win-or-lose" mantra. With a target of 536 runs, surviving the day to draw the match and preserve their 1-0 series lead appears to be the most realistic goal. This situation presents the first major test of the team's rigid attacking principles.</p>

          <p>Following a public falling out with President Donald Trump and a poll of his social media followers, Elon Musk has announced the creation of a new political party called the "America Party." The billionaire tech entrepreneur, who had previously been a major Trump backer and served in his administration, framed the move as a response to a "one-party system" of government waste. The announcement comes after Musk fiercely opposed a new tax-cut and spending bill signed by Trump, escalating a feud that saw the president threaten subsidies for Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, stated they were caught off guard by the catastrophic flash floods that killed at least 27 people. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night while residents were asleep, providing little time for warnings or evacuations. A local county judge noted the absence of a river warning system and said authorities had no reason to believe the rainfall would be so severe, despite the region's history of flooding.

The work, dictated by Twain over several years, is unconventional and non-linear, resembling a modern blog where he discussed whatever was on his mind. Twain specified the century-long embargo to allow himself the freedom to speak candidly about his contemporaries, including scathing remarks about figures like President Theodore Roosevelt, without causing immediate hurt.

The Anti-Defamation League called the use of the slur, which originates from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," both "troubling and irresponsible." When questioned, the president claimed he was unaware of the term's offensive connotations, stating he understood it to simply mean a moneylender charging high rates.

          <p>A mysterious figure dressed in a black bodysuit and cat mask, dubbed "panther man," has been sighted prowling and making "growling" noises near a pub in Wallasey, on the Wirral. Grainy footage shows the individual wriggling under fences, leading some concerned residents to draw comparisons to the "Somerset Gimp," who menaced a community for years. While some witnesses found the behavior bizarre but harmless, others expressed fear that the situation could escalate. Despite local concerns, Merseyside Police have not opened an investigation, as no crime has been officially reported.</p>

          <h2>AI Analysis Explores How Billionaires Are Taxed Compared to the Middle Class</h2>

          <p>An inquiry posed to ChatGPT about taxing billionaires at middle-class rates revealed key nuances in the U.S. tax system. The AI noted that while the wealthiest Americans pay a high effective tax rate on reported income, the core issue is how wealth is taxed versus labor. Middle-class workers are taxed immediately on their wages, whereas the ultra-wealthy derive most of their financial gains from appreciating assets like stocks, which are only taxed upon sale. The article explains the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where billionaires live off tax-free loans against their assets, deferring taxes indefinitely. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics and former SSA officials point out the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, phased-out deduction. The communication was blasted as a "blatant political statement" and a "lie," with observers noting its partisan tone is highly unusual for the typically apolitical agency.

Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, particularly regarding immigration, and felt the party had not been entirely transparent about its plans. While some were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of the situation, others felt "lied to." The government's recent U-turns on policy were seen as worrying, contributing to a sense that the party lacks a clear direction, with some voters now considering supporting Reform UK.</p>

McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing, stating his actions were compliant with regulations, but requested the whip be suspended as a "precautionary measure."

          <p>President Trump has escalated his threats of retribution against political opponents, raising concerns among democracy advocates about the weaponization of state power. In the past week, he has suggested revoking Elon Musk's citizenship, arresting prospective NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, and investigating former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. While some view these as distractions, watchdog groups warn that the threats themselves erode freedom by creating a climate of fear. This pattern of behavior targets both former allies and critics, signaling a willingness to use government authority to punish dissent.</p>

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems has led to an increase in tip requests in unexpected places, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks, a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation." This trend, which accelerated during the pandemic, leaves many customers confused about when and how much to tip. The design of payment interfaces often defaults to pre-calculated options of 15-25%, pressuring consumers to tip more than they might otherwise. Experts note that while this can increase employee income, it can also lead to "guilt tipping," which irritates customers and may deter them from returning.</p>

This perception could effectively end any remaining possibility of denuclearization. The development may also worry China, as it could lead to a more entrenched North Korean nuclear program, further destabilizing the region.</p>
