          <p>China is actively utilizing the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit to assert its role as a stable and peaceful global power amidst ongoing international changes. President Xi Jinping highlighted China's commitment to multilateralism, solidarity, and cooperation as essential for tackling global challenges, positioning the nation as a source of stability and certainty. With approximately 30 world leaders and heads of international organizations attending, the event is considered a major diplomatic undertaking for China. Analysts are closely observing how Beijing strategically uses this platform to enhance its global influence and leadership, particularly in the context of rising geopolitical tensions, demonstrating its diplomatic prowess and vision for global development.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.1 billion, becoming the fifth-largest in the game's history, following the absence of a grand prize winner in Saturday night's drawing. The winning numbers were 3, 18, 22, 27, and 33, with a Powerball of 17, and while nine tickets matched five white balls for $1 million, no one secured the full jackpot. The upcoming Monday night drawing offers an estimated cash value of $498.4 million before taxes, or an annuity option with increasing annual payments. This significant prize continues to build excitement across the 45 participating states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as players hope to end the jackpot drought since May 31.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists operating near the California-Oregon border are pioneering an innovative method to protect livestock from gray wolves, employing drones that blast loud sounds, including AC/DC music and voice clips from actress Scarlett Johansson. This experimental technique, developed by USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service scientists, aims to startle and deter wolves, thereby reducing conflicts with ranchers. While preliminary studies have shown success in interrupting wolf hunts, the long-term effectiveness and high cost of the specialized drones (around $20,000) present challenges for widespread adoption. Environmental advocates are optimistic about the potential for varied hazing methods, though some ranchers express skepticism about its sustained impact as wolves might eventually habituate to the noise.</p>

          <p>The No. 9 LSU Tigers clinched a hard-fought 17-10 road victory against the No. 4 Clemson Tigers in a defensive showdown marked by limited offensive production from both sides. Early drives saw multiple punts and turnovers, with Clemson scoring the game's first touchdown late in the second half, only for LSU to tie it after halftime. LSU eventually seized the lead with a touchdown pass from quarterback Garrett Nussmeier to Trey-Dez Green in the fourth quarter. Clemson's subsequent drives stalled, including a critical turnover on downs, allowing LSU to hold on for the upset. Nussmeier delivered a solid performance, completing 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards, while Clemson's offense struggled to find rhythm, ultimately contributing to their defeat.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' lead in the National League West has shrunk to just one game after a 6-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite a strong performance from pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow, who has not recorded a win since March 31, took a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, but received minimal offensive support from his team. The Dodgers managed only one run and were one for eight with runners in scoring position, leaving eight runners on base. This loss highlights a recurring issue for Glasnow, who has frequently pitched well without getting a win due to his team's scoring struggles.</p>

          <p>The Stringfellow family, traditional Scottish showpeople, are fighting a legal battle against Glasgow City Council to prevent eviction from their Govan yard, where they have lived for over 40 years. The council seeks to redevelop the area as part of a multi-million-pound regeneration plan, arguing the family has no right to occupy the land. The case, heading to Scotland's highest court, is significant as it tests the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, with lawyers arguing the eviction would breach the five-year-old granddaughter's right to a secure home. The family insists alternative sites offered by the council are unsuitable for their unique cultural heritage and lifestyle.</p>

          <h2>German Beer Sales Decline While Non-Alcoholic Varieties Gain Popularity</h2>

          <p>German beer sales have reached their lowest point in over 30 years, falling by 6.3% in the first half of 2025, but non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. This shift reflects changing drinking habits, with younger Germans increasingly opting for alcohol-free options due to greater health awareness. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting alcohol-free beer at sporting events as a natural alternative to energy drinks. While full-strength beer remains a significant part of German culture, particularly in Bavaria, there's a clear trend towards more conscious consumption, indicating a gradual but noticeable change in the country's beer landscape.</p>

          <p>The iconic Metal Gear Solid series has returned with a remake of its third installment, "Metal Gear Solid Delta," nearly a decade after its acclaimed creator, Hideo Kojima, acrimoniously left publisher Konami. The original series pioneered cinematic gaming and tackled complex themes, making Kojima a renowned industry figure. His departure in 2015, reportedly due to spiraling development costs for "Metal Gear Solid V," left the franchise directionless. This remake, praised by fans for its faithfulness to the original's essence, improved graphics, and audio, capitalizes on the growing trend of lucrative game remakes. It marks Konami's return to console gaming and demonstrates the enduring legacy of Kojima's vision.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers and their instructors in the UK are facing a growing problem of abuse and intimidation from other road users, with incidents ranging from tailgating and flashing lights to physical assault. Despite displaying mandatory L plates, learners like Teddy report severe anxiety, while instructors describe daily aggressive behavior. To combat this, many instructors are installing dashcams, with footage leading to action in 7 out of 10 cases submitted to the National Dashcam Safety Portal. Police emphasize powers to deal with inconsiderate driving, including vehicle impoundment for repeat offenders. This highlights a need for greater empathy and kindness on the roads to ensure a safer learning environment.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," a new reality dating show hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of "Love Island" and "Survivor." Couples meet for five minutes, get matched by experts, have a fake wedding, and are then stranded on a remote tropical island in beach huts. Contestants face harsh conditions, including mosquitoes, extreme heat, and lack of modern amenities, designed to test if love can truly thrive in isolation. Participants praise the show's authenticity and less superficial approach compared to other dating programs, suggesting that facing adversity together can build stronger relationships.</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, an almost 1,000-year-old artwork documenting the Norman invasion of England, will close to the public in France as it prepares for a controversial move to London. French art experts and a 60,000-signature petition fiercely oppose the loan to the British Museum, fearing the 70-meter-long masterpiece is too delicate for transport, citing potential irreparable damage from vibrations. Despite French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announcing the loan, specialists' advice against the move has been largely overridden. The tapestry is expected to be displayed in London for a year starting next September, with other artifacts exchanged in return.</p>

          <p>The UK is intensifying its fight against the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating pest that poses a multi-billion-pound threat to the nation's forests. Originally thought to arrive via imported wood, the beetles are now confirmed to be blown over from continental Europe on winds. Government scientists are employing an unusual arsenal, including drones for aerial surveys, sniffer dogs trained to detect beetle pheromones and frass, and nuclear atmospheric dispersion models adapted to predict beetle incursions. While the UK claims success in eradicating the beetle from high-risk areas, climate change and increasing populations in Europe continue to escalate the threat, requiring sustained vigilance.</p>

          <p>A California state bill, SB 256, aimed at requiring investor-owned utilities like Southern California Edison to remove decommissioned power lines to mitigate wildfire risks, failed to advance in Sacramento. Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, who introduced the bill following the devastating Eaton fire, expressed frustration over its failure, citing the need for utility accountability. The legislation sought to improve wildfire mitigation planning, emergency response, and undergrounding power lines, especially after concerns that an idle Edison transmission line might have caused the Eaton fire. Despite utilities withdrawing formal opposition, Pérez suspects "shadow lobbying" contributed to the bill's unexpected demise, leaving residents and advocates dismayed.</p>

          <p>The temporary immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is being shut down after a judge's order, just two months after its opening. The facility became a polarizing symbol of President Trump's immigration policy, with conflicting reports on its conditions. Families of detainees allege severe medical neglect and lack of legal access, with one inmate claiming he was left bleeding and denied proper care. The Department of Homeland Security denies these claims, asserting proper medical care was provided. The closure comes as other temporary facilities, like "Deportation Depot" and "Speedway Slammer," are being built in Republican-led states, indicating a continued push for more detention infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has a legal but largely unregulated industry of "body brokers" who acquire, dissect, and sell human body parts for profit, often to medical research centers. This trade, effectively outlawed in Europe, thrives due to loose U.S. laws allowing charges for "processing" body parts rather than outright sale. Critics decry it as a modern form of grave-robbing, citing horror stories like Harold Dillard's family finding his dismembered head after he donated his body for medical science. While proponents argue it's essential for medical training and research, the lack of oversight leads to exploitation of vulnerable families and ethical concerns, prompting calls for stricter regulation.</p>
