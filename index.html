          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called for urgent action from universities to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination, citing an unacceptable increase in antisemitism on campuses where many Jewish students no longer feel safe. The government is funding training programs to equip university staff and students in identifying and tackling hate, alongside initiatives promoting interfaith understanding and combating online misinformation. This push follows a significant 117% rise in antisemitic incidents on university campuses over the past two academic years and ongoing protests related to the Gaza conflict, underscoring the critical need for comprehensive measures to ensure secure and inclusive environments for all students.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is mourning the death of Oscar-winning actress Diane Keaton at 79, celebrated for her iconic roles in films like "Annie Hall" and "The Godfather." Heartfelt tributes have poured in from numerous stars, including Goldie Hawn, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, and Bette Midler, who fondly remembered her unique genius, humor, and unwavering humility. PETA also acknowledged Keaton's significant impact as an animal advocate, highlighting her compassion for creatures often overlooked, such as pigeons, and her support for animal welfare legislation. Her passing leaves a profound void in the entertainment world, but her legacy of creativity and kindness will undoubtedly endure.</p>

          <p>A murder investigation is underway in Stafford, UK, after a two-year-old girl, Meraj Ul Zahra, and a three-year-old boy, Abdul Momin Alfaateh, were found deceased at a Corporation Street residence. Both children were injured and unresponsive, leading to the arrest of a 43-year-old woman from Stafford on suspicion of murder; she remains in custody. The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to earlier police contact, with authorities urging the public not to speculate as they diligently work to uncover the events preceding this profound tragedy that has shocked the quiet community.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown has led to significant disruptions, including the initial firing and subsequent reinstatement of approximately 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) workers after erroneous layoff notices. Vice President JD Vance warned of potential deeper federal workforce cuts if the stalemate continues, placing blame on Democrats for their stance on healthcare subsidies. While the Trump administration seeks to reduce government size, it has ensured military pay. Meanwhile, the shutdown's impact is broadening, with several Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo temporarily closing their doors due to a lack of funding, affecting public services nationwide.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals How Dietary Fiber Protects Body from Sugar Damage via Gut Bacteria</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 16:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking UC Irvine study has uncovered how dietary fiber, specifically inulin found in vegetables like onions and garlic, protects the body from the harmful effects of sugar by reshaping gut bacteria. Researchers discovered that these gut microbes metabolize fructose in the small intestine before it reaches the liver, preventing overwhelming sugar spillover and fat accumulation. This mechanism not only shields against sugar damage but can also reverse signs of fatty liver disease, reducing fat and boosting liver antioxidants. The findings offer crucial insights for personalized nutrition and potential new treatments for metabolic conditions, emphasizing fiber's vital role in overall health.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend an international peace summit where the first phase of a US-brokered Gaza peace plan is slated for signing. The summit follows a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with Starmer planning to commend President Donald Trump's pivotal role in the negotiations. Despite UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson's claims of Britain's key involvement, US and Israeli officials have largely dismissed this, leading to political controversy. The gathering of over 20 nations aims to solidify the truce, facilitate humanitarian aid, and establish a foundation for enduring peace and security in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" in the ongoing government shutdown, criticizing their insistence on extending expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government. Vance asserted that the Trump administration would not negotiate under such pressure, framing the Democratic stance as an attempt to leverage the entire federal government for a policy dispute. This deep partisan stalemate has already resulted in layoffs for over 4,000 federal workers, with Vance attributing the resulting chaos and disruptions to Democratic intransigence.

          <p>China has declared it is "not afraid of" a trade war with the United States, accusing the US of a "textbook double standard" in response to President Donald Trump's threat of additional 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing defended its new export controls on rare earth minerals as legitimate national security measures, contrasting its approximately 900-item export control list with the US Commerce Control list's over 3,000 items. US Trade Representative Jamison Greer called China's move a "power grab," stating the US was not notified in advance. These escalating tensions have already caused a $2 trillion drop in US equity values, highlighting significant economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina's office announced an attempt to seize power illegally and by force, just hours before an army unit, CAPSAT, claimed control of all armed forces. This escalating crisis follows youth-led protests against Rajoelina's government, fueled by high unemployment, corruption, and the cost-of-living crisis. CAPSAT, which played a crucial role in Rajoelina's 2009 ascent, notably condemned the use of force against protesters and saw some of its troops join demonstrations.
