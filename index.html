          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly threatened top-ranking military officers with polygraph tests after becoming upset about media reports concerning a planned briefing for Elon Musk on China. ABC News confirmed that Hegseth accused officers of leaking information to the media in at least two separate meetings. In one instance, he allegedly yelled at Adm. Christopher Grady, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, threatening him with a polygraph. A spokesperson for the Joint Staff declined to comment on the incident, which was initially reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>

          <p>The 'Gran Abuelo,' a 5,400-year-old Alerce tree in Chile, faces threats from a proposed highway that would cut through its protected rainforest habitat.

          <p>Global markets saw an upswing as investors reacted positively to potential signs of easing trade tensions. This optimism was partly driven by reports suggesting China is considering exempting some American goods from its 125 percent tariff. However, the Chinese government refuted claims of ongoing trade negotiations with Washington, contradicting President Trump's assertions. Asian markets generally rose, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and Taiwan's benchmark index both experiencing significant gains, while European stocks also showed positive movement.</p>

          <p>Japan's Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) is advocating for a one-year suspension of the consumption tax on food items as the country anticipates a parliamentary election this summer. This proposal comes amid concerns about persistent inflation and potential economic repercussions from higher U.S. tariffs. While Prime Minister Ishiba has resisted altering the consumption tax rate, the CDPJ argues that the tax cut is necessary to alleviate financial strain on households. Other parties are also considering similar measures to address the economic challenges facing Japanese citizens.</p>

The measures will include financial support and potential reductions in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This decision follows recent tariff escalations between Washington and Beijing, which have led major Wall Street banks to lower their China GDP forecasts for the year.

          <p>China has concluded that coral reef degradation near Sandy Cay in the South China Sea is due to Philippine construction and fishing activities on nearby Thitu Island. A Chinese research team, after conducting satellite image analysis and on-site inspections, found the coral ecosystem around Sandy Cay to be severely degraded, while the ecology at Whitsun Reef remained generally healthy. The team cited frequent human activities by the Philippines as a contributing factor, along with natural phenomena such as tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced their largest increase in nearly four years during the first few months of the year, primarily driven by warmer weather in March that boosted sales across various sectors. According to the Office for National Statistics, sales volumes rose by 1.6% between January and March, the most significant increase since July 2021. Garden centers and clothing and DIY goods saw improved demand, while food sales, particularly at supermarkets, declined. Despite this positive trend, analysts caution that sales may weaken in the coming months due to a decline in consumer confidence.</p>

The court found that Amazon did not take effective measures against fake products, even after being notified of their availability, leading to a decline in the plaintiffs' sales.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), raising concerns about water flow into Pakistan. The 1960 treaty allocated the three eastern rivers of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western rivers to Pakistan. Pakistan has objected to some of India's hydropower projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. Experts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back the Indus basin's waters during high-flow periods due to inadequate infrastructure, but Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season.</p>

          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council, Sean Stein, argues that the United States may overestimate its leverage in trade negotiations with China. Stein suggests China has been preparing for a trade war since 2018 and does not perceive the need for a deal with the same urgency as the White House. He also points out that the US underestimates China's desire to avoid being seen as bullied on the global stage, making a quick resolution to trade tensions unlikely.</p>
