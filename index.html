          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to respond forcefully after a Houthi missile struck near Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's primary international airport. The missile, launched from Yemen by the Iran-backed group, caused minor injuries and prompted a temporary suspension of flights. Netanyahu asserted that the attacks originated from Iran and promised a response to both the Houthis and Iran at a time and place of Israel's choosing. The incident marked a significant security breach, raising concerns about Israel's ability to intercept such attacks. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill allocates $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Supporters hail the bill as a victory for parents and students, providing them with the freedom to choose the educational option that best suits their needs. However, Democrats argue that the legislation will undermine public schools by diverting funds to private institutions. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Germany commemorated the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp, a pivotal moment as the last survivors and liberators pass away, coinciding with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. At a memorial ceremony, a 100-year-old U.S. Army veteran who helped liberate Dachau spoke of the profound impact of witnessing the camp's horrors. The anniversary also occurs amid increased antisemitic hate crimes and concerns about the state of liberal democracy in Germany.

          <p>The de minimis tariff exemption, which allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has expired, leading to higher prices for consumers on goods from China. Retailers like Shein and Temu, which heavily relied on this loophole, are expected to raise prices, potentially diminishing the market for these goods. Trade experts anticipate administrative challenges and shipment delays due to increased inspections by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. While companies selling goods made in the U.S. may benefit from reduced competition, consumers are likely to experience sticker shock and may trade down to cheaper alternatives.

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he resisted pressure from President Trump to overturn the election results. Pence defied Trump by declining to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during a Congressional session that was targeted by rioters. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power. The award recognizes individuals who take principled stands, even in the face of criticism and falling popularity. Optimism score: 70</p>

The incident marks a major security breach at one of the most heavily protected sites in the country, and is likely to raise questions about Israel’s ability to intercept such attacks despite its vaunted missile defense system. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis. Since Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza started in October 2023, the country has come under fire from missiles and rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>President Trump's moves to enlarge executive power are rooted in a tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical rule, drawing from theorists like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. These thinkers emphasize the need for decisive action by the executive, even beyond established legal and moral boundaries. The influence of the Claremont Institute and figures like Russell Vought further contributes to this view, which seeks to consolidate power in the presidency. The danger lies in transforming the presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers. Optimism score: 40</p>
