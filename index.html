          <h2>Diane Abbott Claims Labour Leadership is Forcing Her Out Following Second Suspension</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 03:16:58 EDT</div>

          <p>British MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party for a second time after reiterating controversial comments about racism. In a BBC interview, she defended her view that racism against Black people is distinct from prejudice faced by Jewish or Traveller communities due to skin color being immediately visible. Abbott stated it is obvious the party leadership wants her out, a claim that comes amid an ongoing investigation into her remarks. The suspension means the long-serving MP will now sit as an independent, sparking debate within the party about discipline and free speech.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, holding the group responsible for the deadly April attack in Pahalgam, India, that killed 26 people. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, another designated terrorist group. India has welcomed the decision, viewing it as a strong affirmation of its counterterrorism cooperation with the United States. The designation is seen by experts as a significant gesture of support for India amid heightened regional tensions following the attack.</p>

          <p>Germany has resumed deportation flights to Afghanistan, sending back 81 Afghan men with criminal records. This marks the first such collective repatriation under the new government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz, which has advocated for a tougher migration policy. The Interior Ministry stated the deportations align with a coalition agreement to remove criminals and individuals deemed a threat. The move follows a 10-month pause on deportations to Afghanistan that began after the Taliban's takeover in 2021, signaling a significant shift in Germany's approach to asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight from Omaha to Detroit was forced to make an emergency landing in Cedar Rapids, Michigan, after a passenger became disruptive. According to air traffic control audio, the 23-year-old man was fighting with a flight attendant while trying to open an emergency exit door. Law enforcement met the aircraft upon landing and arrested the passenger, who now faces multiple charges including disorderly conduct and assault. The flight, carrying 67 passengers and four crew members, was able to continue to its destination after the incident, and an investigation is currently ongoing.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street, accusing it of market manipulation, which has reignited debate over the distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal practices. SEBI alleges the firm deliberately distorted India's Nifty 50 index in less liquid markets to profit from larger positions in the more liquid options market. Experts note the key distinction is intent, or 'mens rea'; arbitrage exploits existing price differences, while manipulation involves actively creating those differences for unfair gain. The case highlights the complexities of regulating high-frequency trading in markets with varying liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

Fire beetles possess a specialized organ that can detect faint infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away, an evolutionary trait linked to their reproductive cycle.

          <h2>Brazilian President Lula Denounces Trump's Tariff Threats as 'Unacceptable Blackmail'</h2>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as "unacceptable blackmail." Trump has linked the proposed tariffs to the ongoing legal proceedings against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula asserted that any attempt to interfere in Brazil's independent judiciary is a grave attack on its national sovereignty. The escalating dispute highlights the tense relationship between the two leaders and could become a central issue in Brazil's 2026 presidential election, where Lula may run for re-election.</p>

          <h2>Reflecting on Turning 35, an Author Concludes Most Adults are 'Winging It'</h2>

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Alexander Hurst reflects on reaching the age of 35 and the realization that adulthood lacks the clear certainties he imagined as a child. He uses the French comedy series "Bref" as a cultural touchstone, comparing its depiction of a young man's chaotic life with the more complex, slower-paced realities of aging. The author concludes that the biggest lesson of adulthood is that most people are improvising their way through life. He finds value not in having all the answers but in embracing life's unexpected turns and deep relationships.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has fulfilled a lifelong dream by successfully building and operating his own 7-meter-long submarine. Zhang, who had managed a local dock for years, was inspired by a television program featuring a submarine and decided to build one himself. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the vessel. His creation has since become a local spectacle, drawing stares from villagers as he pilots it along the river, demonstrating remarkable ingenuity and determination.</p>

          <p>Stephen Colbert announced that CBS will be ending "The Late Show" when his contract expires in May 2026, and he will not be replaced. The network stated the cancellation is a financial decision unrelated to the show's content or performance, as Colbert has consistently led late-night ratings. However, the move has sparked skepticism, coming shortly after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount Global for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump. Critics, including prominent Democrats, have called for transparency, questioning if the decision was politically motivated amid Paramount's pending merger approval.</p>

          <p>A prominent index tracking China's transition to a market-based economy has declined for the first time in years, prompting calls from economists for renewed pro-market reforms. The National Economic Research Institute reported that the country's overall marketization score fell in 2023, with the largest drop seen in the sub-index measuring government-market relations. Researchers point to this as a significant negative change, urging action to reverse the trend of increased government intervention. The report highlights concerns about tackling economic imbalances and fostering healthy competition within Chinese industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, as a surge in rice prices began to ease. While the figure was in line with market expectations, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists note that underlying price pressures persist, and the economic outlook is complicated by potential U.S. tariffs and domestic political uncertainty ahead of the upcoming Upper House election. Real wages continue to decline, and vigilance is required regarding future consumer spending trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic argues that the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" may not be a purely financial decision as CBS claims. The author suggests it fits a pattern of the network's parent company, Paramount Global, making decisions that appease the Trump administration, especially as it seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance. The piece cites the recent settlement of Trump's lawsuit against CBS and the departure of the head of "60 Minutes" as evidence. It frames Colbert's ouster as another step in the erosion of the network's journalistic independence.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters admitted on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting on a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission comes after Newsom filed a $787-million defamation lawsuit against Watters and the network, claiming they lied about the timeline of the call to politically harm him. Watters acknowledged he misunderstood a social media post from Newsom but offered a sarcastic apology, stating the governor was "confusing and unclear." Newsom responded by indicating he has no intention of dropping the lawsuit.</p>
