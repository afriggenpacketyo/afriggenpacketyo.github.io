        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising seniors on the best age to consider a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows homeowners to tap into their home equity without immediate repayment. Factors such as current age, the amount of equity, and long-term financial goals are crucial in this decision. While the minimum qualifying age is typically 62, many specialists suggest that the late 60s to early 70s often represents a "sweet spot," as older borrowers can access more funds and have a clearer picture of their retirement needs.

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new rule that would prevent employees of certain nonprofit organizations from receiving benefits under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The U.S. Department of Education aims to exclude organizations that are deemed to be "undermining national security and American values." Critics argue the vague language could be used to politically target advocacy groups, though officials have stated the changes would not be applied retroactively to past service.

          <p>Several European leaders have made an urgent trip to Washington to meet with President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, aiming to address a perceived shift in U.S. strategy for ending the war in Ukraine. The visit follows Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin, after which the U.S. reportedly dropped its demand for a ceasefire as a precondition for peace talks. European officials are concerned this new approach could undermine their continent's security and lead to a premature or unfavorable resolution for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has ruled that the ongoing strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants is illegal and has ordered them to immediately return to work. The job action, which began during the peak summer travel season, has caused hundreds of flight cancellations and disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily.

The report clarifies that aid from all parties has been a mixture of both grants and loans, aiming to provide a clear picture of the financial and military backing Ukraine has received.</p>
