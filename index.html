          <p>The G7 summit in Canada, hosted by Prime Minister Mark Carney, faced disruptions due to the escalating war between Israel and Iran and President Trump's unexpected departure. Despite these challenges, leaders addressed key issues such as trade, Ukraine, and global cooperation. Trump's early exit led to missed bilateral meetings but also fostered a more relaxed atmosphere among the remaining leaders, according to some observers. Carney emphasized the summit's focus on long-term resilience and secured joint statements on artificial intelligence, migrant smuggling, and critical minerals, showcasing an "outcomes focused" approach to diplomacy. 75</p>

          <p>Rafael Devers is beginning his career with the San Francisco Giants after a trade from the Boston Red Sox, expressing his willingness to play wherever the team needs him. This contrasts with his earlier reluctance to change positions with the Red Sox, where he initially resisted moving from third base. Devers emphasized his commitment to giving 100% to the Giants and deferring to the team's decisions regarding his role. The Giants assume the financial responsibilities of his 10-year deal, hoping Devers will contribute significantly to their performance in the NL West. 70</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's decision to federalize the state's National Guard amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The state argues that the deployment diverts guardsmen from critical work, such as wildfire prevention, and infringes on state sovereignty. The Trump administration maintains that the deployment is within the president's authority to address a rebellion against the authority of the United States. The court did not issue an immediate ruling, leaving the status of the National Guard deployment uncertain. 50</p>

The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, including additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier, moves officials describe as defensive.

          <p>R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after allegedly being given an excessive amount of medication by prison staff, according to his lawyer. The lawyer claims Kelly's life is in danger and that the Bureau of Prisons is trying to kill him to cover up crimes related to his case. Kelly's legal team is requesting a judge to move him to home detention, citing blood clots in his legs and lungs that require surgery. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on the specific allegations, citing privacy and security reasons. 10</p>
