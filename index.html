          <p>Authorities have identified Christopher Revak, who died by suicide in 2009, as responsible for the 2006 murder of Deidre Harm in Wisconsin, officially closing a nearly two-decade-old case. Revak was also charged with the 2007 murder of Rene Williams in Missouri and had long been a person of interest in the 1995 disappearance of Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit. Investigators are now examining his potential connection to as many as five homicides over a 14-year period, suggesting he was a possible serial killer with a "dark side." This development brings some closure for Harm's family while fueling ongoing efforts to solve other cold cases.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 18:00:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of "fabricating a new war" after the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean. This move significantly increases US firepower, which the Pentagon states is aimed at disrupting narcotics trafficking and dismantling transnational criminal organizations. Maduro, denying US accusations of leading a drug-trafficking organization, fears the military build-up is intended to remove him from power, especially as the US does not recognize his legitimacy following the widely disputed 2024 election. US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, downplayed the deployment's broader implications, yet reiterated concerns about Venezuela's role in the illegal drug trade. Military analysts question if such a large force is necessary for drug interdiction.</p>

          <p>China has become the world leader in producing lab-grown diamonds, with companies like Zhongjing Diamond using specialized 50-tonne machines to simulate Earth's crust conditions, creating flawless stones in just days. This rapid production allows China to churn out more rough artificial diamonds than all other nations combined, significantly lowering costs. The booming sales of these gems, which sparkle just as brightly for a fraction of the price, are rapidly winning over consumers. The market for lab-grown diamonds is projected to grow from $25.89 billion in 2024 to $74.45 billion by 2032, fundamentally reshaping the global diamond industry and challenging traditional perceptions of diamond value.</p>

          <h2>Trump Increases Tariffs on Canadian Goods Following Disputed Reagan Anti-Tariff Ad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 17:51:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports, citing Ontario's "fraudulent" anti-tariff advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan. Trump called the ad's airing during the World Series a "hostile act," despite Ontario Premier Doug Ford's intention to pause it after the weekend. The Reagan Foundation had previously criticized the ad for using "selective" audio and misrepresenting Reagan's 1987 address on trade. This escalation intensifies existing trade tensions, with Canada being the only G7 country without a new trade deal with the US.

          <p>The National Lottery's Saturday evening Lotto draw was abruptly halted due to a "technical fault" when the bonus ball failed to drop from the draw machine, causing the live program to cut off. Operator Allwyn confirmed the draw's pause and announced it would resume as soon as possible with an alternative machine, under the supervision of an independent adjudicator. The company, which took over the lottery license in 2024 after 30 years under Camelot, apologized for the delay and confirmed verified results would be published later. The exact cause of the glitch remains unknown, leading to public frustration and an unavailable YouTube stream for the draw.</p>

          <p>Independent left-wing politician Catherine Connolly has been elected Ireland's 10th president after a landslide victory over rival Heather Humphreys, becoming the country's first anti-establishment head of state. Connolly, a seasoned TD and Dail deputy speaker, successfully campaigned as a "movement," backed by major left-wing opposition parties. Her composed debating style and engaging social media presence, featuring viral athletic videos, garnered significant attention, especially from younger voters. Despite scrutiny over her outspoken support for Palestine and criticism of NATO, Connolly's clear mandate reflects a public desire for change.

          <p>China's housing market is experiencing a significant downturn, marked by a surge in foreclosures and properties liquidated at substantial discounts on e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and JD.com. Judicial auctions in the first half of 2024 saw properties sell for just 77% of their appraised value, suppressing home prices and buyer sentiment. The number of foreclosed properties added to auction lists is projected to exceed 1 million this year, with some estimates suggesting over 4 million units already flooding the market. This situation draws comparisons to the 2000s US subprime mortgage crisis, raising concerns about potential financial instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a spectacular daylight heist that exposed significant security flaws, the Louvre Museum has transferred some of its most precious remaining jewels to the Bank of France's ultra-secure "Souterraine" vault. This vault, located 26 meters underground, already houses 90% of France's gold reserves and other national treasures, valued at an estimated €600 million. The move comes after thieves used an angle grinder and a mechanical ladder to breach the Louvre's Gallery of Apollo, stealing €88 million worth of jewels, including pieces belonging to Napoleon's wife.

          <p>A 24-year-old Honduran man, Jose Castro Rivera, died after being struck by a vehicle on a Virginia highway while attempting to flee Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This incident marks the third known fatality involving immigrants trying to evade detention during the Trump administration's mass deportation crackdown. Previous deaths include a Guatemalan man fleeing an ICE raid in California and a Mexican farm worker who fell 30 feet from a greenhouse. Despite claims that raids target "illegal criminals," government data shows immigrants with no criminal record now constitute the largest group in US immigration detention, raising concerns about enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik has denied wrongdoing following the death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, calling it a tragedy while condemning a "cynical campaign of harassment" against him. Kramnik had previously accused Naroditsky of online cheating without evidence, allegations that Naroditsky said took a toll on his mental health. Police are investigating Naroditsky's death as a possible suicide or overdose. Kramnik claims he publicly called for help for Naroditsky before his death and offered to assist a criminal investigation, while facing widespread condemnation from the chess community and an ethics review by the International Chess Federation (Fide).</p>

          <p>The recent daylight heist at the Louvre, where masked thieves stole "priceless" jewels, quickly transformed into an internet obsession, generating memes and pop culture commentary. Brands like Böcker and IKEA created cheeky ads, while influencers and actors like George Clooney joined the viral trend, joking about the "Ocean's 14" film. One stolen item, Empress Eugénie's crown, was recovered damaged near the scene, but eight others remain missing. The fascination stems partly from the fantasy the story invites and a public preference for reading about a heist over a massacre. Meanwhile, French authorities continue their investigation, collecting forensic evidence and scrutinizing the museum's security failures, particularly the lack of cameras in the Apollo Gallery.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has indicated her political career is not over, stating "I am not done" and leaving open the possibility of another presidential run in a BBC interview. Promoting her new book "107 Days," Harris reflected on her 2024 loss to Donald Trump, whom she called a "tyrant," and claimed her predictions about his authoritarian government had been realized. She also criticized businesses and universities for bowing to his demands. While not committing to a 2028 bid, she believes a woman will be in the White House in her grandnieces' lifetime. Polling in her home state shows less than a third of California voters endorse another run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US job market is in a "Great Freeze," characterized by low layoffs but also significantly reduced hiring, according to a ZipRecruiter report. This phenomenon means companies are retaining existing talent due to economic uncertainties and past labor shortages, but are reluctant to add new headcount. While offering some job security, this "lockup" hinders career growth for workers, who may struggle to find new opportunities or negotiate raises. The number of job openings has cooled, making it tough for the 7.4 million unemployed individuals to secure positions. Economists predict this static environment may persist without a clear catalyst for change. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular passive investing strategy, "VOO and chill" (buying S&P 500 ETFs like VOO), may be losing its appeal as investors seek greater diversification. Experts note that technology stocks now comprise over 35% of the S&P 500, a record high, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight of 19%. This imbalance leads to a lack of true diversification within the index. Consequently, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500. This shift suggests investors are looking beyond concentrated tech exposure for broader market opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reclusive billionaire Timothy Mellon, a major Donald Trump backer and heir to the Mellon banking family, has been identified as the anonymous donor who gave $130 million to help pay US troops during the ongoing government shutdown. Trump had previously praised the "patriot" donor without naming him. The donation, which equates to about $100 per service member, is legally controversial, potentially violating the Antideficiency Act by spending unappropriated federal funds. Mellon is a significant political donor, having contributed over $165 million to Republican candidates in 2024, including $125 million to Trump's Super PAC, and has a history of anti-tax and anti-immigration stances.</p>

          <p>The ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur is set to address regional economic integration, security, and digital developments, but will be heavily influenced by the growing rivalry between the US and China. ASEAN nations are increasingly pressured to choose sides amidst disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea. While some economically weaker states align closely with China, larger countries like the Philippines and Indonesia strive for a delicate balancing act, maintaining defense ties with the US while fostering strong economic relations with China. Many ASEAN politicians are wary of Trump's tariff policies and perceive the US as an unreliable partner, further complicating regional stability.</p>
