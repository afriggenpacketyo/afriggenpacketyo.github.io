          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 22:46:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed significant signs of slowing in July, as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output failed to meet forecasts. Retail sales grew by only 3.7%, falling short of the expected 4.6%, while industrial output also underperformed. This slowdown is attributed to weakening domestic demand and the fading effects of earlier government stimulus measures. Economists are now cautioning that China may struggle to meet its annual growth target of 5% without new policy support, highlighting persistent risks to its economic performance.

          <p>Mali's military leadership announced it has foiled a coup attempt, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national accused of being a foreign agent. The junta, which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021, alleged the plot had support from unspecified "foreign states" and was intended to destabilize the country. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent, with critics suggesting the arrests are a tactic to intimidate opponents rather than a response to a genuine coup attempt. The incident further strains Mali's relationship with Western nations, particularly its former colonial ruler, France.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations despite trade pressures from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily fueled by strong export performance, which helped narrow the country's trade deficit. However, on a year-over-year basis, GDP growth slowed, and analysts remain cautious about the future, warning of a potential slowdown. Concerns persist that the impact of tariffs on corporate profits and investment could still pose significant risks to Japan's economic stability in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

The dark navy SUVs and trucks feature large gold "ICE" lettering and the slogan "Defend the Homeland," along with President Donald J. Trump's name embossed on the rear. This public rollout, promoted with a professionally produced video, coincides with intensified federal law enforcement operations in Washington, D.C.

Despite its commercial success, the company's filings acknowledge potential risks from supply chain issues, currency fluctuations, and shifting UK regulations.

          <p>The man who murdered British expatriate Emma Lovell during a home invasion in Queensland, Australia, in 2022 will be eligible for release sooner than initially sentenced. An appeals court reduced his non-parole period from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, cutting his minimum time served by 17 months. The judges cited the attacker's early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and potential for rehabilitation as reasons for the change. Lovell was fatally stabbed after confronting two intruders in her home on Boxing Day, an event that sparked public outrage and led to stricter youth crime laws in the state.</p>

          <p>President Trump has initiated a 30-day federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police department, deploying National Guard troops and federal agents to address what he falsely claims is the worst crime rate the city has ever seen. The move includes clearing homeless encampments and establishing law enforcement checkpoints, sparking protests and condemnation from local officials. Concurrently, the D.C. police chief issued an order allowing the department to notify ICE about undocumented immigrants found during traffic stops. Critics argue the takeover is a political maneuver that damages the city's reputation, while the administration defends it as a necessary crime-fighting measure.</p>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending that the article argues is more true to the character than a traditional fairytale romance. After the original "Sex and the City" ended with all four main characters in committed relationships, the sequel series explored widowhood and new life challenges for Carrie. The finale sees her embracing a future that may not include another great love, instead finding fulfillment in her friendships and independence. This conclusion is seen as a correction to the original series' ending, reinforcing the idea that enduring female friendships are the true soulmates.</p>

The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, the drone's speed is far superior to that of other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use.

          <h2>Poll Finds Most Americans Believe Expectations for Tipping Have Increased</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 20:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that two-thirds of Americans feel that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years, though few view this as a positive development. The survey indicates a divide in how people perceive tipping, with some seeing it as a way to show appreciation or supplement wages, while others view it as an additional mandatory cost. The sentiment that tipping is becoming more prevalent appears linked to broader public concerns about rising prices and the overall cost of living. The poll suggests a growing unease with the expansion of tipping culture into more areas of commerce.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Partners with TikTok Influencers to Warn About Cosmetic Surgery Abroad</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to educate the public about the risks associated with traveling overseas for cosmetic surgery. The campaign addresses growing concerns over "medical tourism," where people seek cheaper procedures like hair implants or dental work abroad, sometimes with dangerous consequences. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor, obtain proper travel insurance, and be wary of package deals that include surgical procedures. This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched operations.</p>

          <p>Eleven Madison Park, the acclaimed New York restaurant that famously switched to an all-vegan menu in 2021, is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm announced the change, citing a desire to be more inclusive and acknowledging a decline in business, particularly for private corporate events and high-end wine sales. The restaurant, which was the first three-Michelin-star establishment to go fully plant-based, will now serve select items like fish, meat, and its signature honey-lavender-glazed duck. The reversal highlights the significant financial and cultural challenges of sustaining a luxury, plant-based dining experience in a market where demand for meat remains high.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after the conflict began, Israeli society is deeply fractured over the war in Gaza, with fault lines widening between different political and social groups. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains a hardline stance of total victory, but faces pressure from hostage families demanding a deal, ultranationalist coalition partners opposing any compromise, and a military leadership concerned about strategic costs. Meanwhile, a growing minority of Israelis are protesting the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, while opinion polls show most Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering. These chasms reflect a nation struggling with ongoing trauma and conflicting visions for its future.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting with Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state, praising their efforts to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. Obama told the legislators their actions were a courageous stand against a "systematic assault on democracy" and had successfully drawn national attention to the issue of partisan gerrymandering. His encouragement comes as California moves forward with a counter-proposal to redraw its own maps, a direct response to the Texas plan. Obama's involvement signals high-level Democratic support for the Texas lawmakers' controversial decision to break quorum to halt the GOP's legislative agenda.</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, their objectives appear to diverge significantly. Putin seeks recognition that Western efforts to isolate Russia have failed and aims to solidify territorial gains in Ukraine, using the meeting to project strength on the global stage. For Trump, the primary goal is to be seen as a peacemaker who can end the war, a promise from his presidential campaign, though his approach has been inconsistent. While the Kremlin wants to sideline European leaders and deal directly with the U.S., Trump's desire for a deal raises concerns among allies that he may agree to concessions unfavorable to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. officials are managing expectations for the hastily arranged summit in Alaska. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the meeting as a chance for the president to quickly assess whether a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine is possible. He emphasized that any lasting peace would require a ceasefire and conversations about security guarantees and territorial disputes, but the ultimate agreement rests with Ukraine and Russia. The location of the summit in Alaska is also noted for its historical significance, as the territory was purchased by the U.S. from Russia in the 19th century.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20 percent, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely to support the growth of artificial intelligence. This expansion, heavily funded by tech giants like Google and Microsoft, is raising significant concerns about the immense energy and water resources the centres will consume. Experts warn that the increased demand on the national grid could lead to higher energy bills for consumers. Environmental groups and local residents are also objecting to the construction, citing the strain on water supplies and the development of greenbelt land. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed, making it appear as if actors are genuinely speaking the new language by manipulating their lip movements. Developed by London-based company Flawless, the technology was used on the Swedish sci-fi film "Watch the Skies," enabling its release in over 100 U.S. theaters. Proponents argue that this innovation can break down language barriers and open up the traditionally challenging U.S. market to a wider range of international cinema. The company emphasizes that the tool is designed to empower creative professionals, using real voice actors rather than replacing them with synthetic voices.</p>
