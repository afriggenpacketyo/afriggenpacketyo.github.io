This upgrade is part of China's broader effort to digitally transform its coal industry and construct intelligent mines, as outlined in a 2020 government initiative.

          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50% during an appearance at a U.S. Steel factory outside Pittsburgh. This move is intended to boost the local steel industry and reduce reliance on China. The announcement is part of Trump's broader strategy to protect American industries through tariffs. The policy change aims to bolster domestic production and create jobs in the steel and aluminum sectors. The increased tariffs are expected to impact global trade relations and potentially increase costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

This would require recipients to prove their assets total less than $2,000 to be eligible for Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services. The proposal aims to tackle rising costs, potentially saving $94 million in the coming fiscal year and increasing savings in subsequent years. Health and disability advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing it would result in people losing coverage and force vulnerable populations into poverty.

Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, also voiced his concern, noting the disparity compared to other sports like rugby union. Some suggest this lack of recognition is linked to class prejudice, as rugby league is often associated with working-class backgrounds. </p>
