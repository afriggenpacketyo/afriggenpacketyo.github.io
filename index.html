            <p>Community members in Pacific Palisades returned to the site of the Community United Methodist Church, destroyed in January's wildfires, to commemorate Good Friday. Pastor John Shaver emphasized the church's resilience, stating it would remain a "community without walls" until rebuilt. The congregation, which has been holding services at alternative locations since the fire, walked through the neighborhood, stopping at nine locations to read Bible verses symbolizing Jesus Christ’s path. Shaver, who also lost his home in the fire, expressed gratitude for the hope provided by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, while Thomas Knoll, a non-religious resident who also lost his home, likened the event to a funeral for Pacific Palisades. The community saved important parts of the church like stone tiles, a metal cross that stood atop its tower and another stone cross.</p>

            <p>The death toll in attacks in Benue state, central Nigeria, has risen to 56, with Governor Hyacinth Alia blaming the violence on suspected herdsmen. Clashes between nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use have become increasingly common in the region, often taking on a religious dimension. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to stem the violence, leaving communities vulnerable to attacks. The conflict is exacerbated by climate change, which has made large areas of northern Nigeria unproductive, driving herders south in search of grazing lands.</p>

            <p>In Hainan, China, Huang Qijun manages a 40-hectare durian orchard with 10,056 trees, utilizing technology to monitor and irrigate each tree. While machines handle some tasks, manual labor is required for weeding and pollination.
