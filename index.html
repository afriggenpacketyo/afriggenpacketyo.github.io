          <p>During President Trump's visit to Scotland, the U.S. and U.K. aim to resolve outstanding issues in their recent trade agreement. Key points of contention include the U.S. desire to remove a British digital services tax and the U.K.'s goal of eliminating the 25% tariff on its steel and aluminum exports. Economists suggest these topics could be part of a straightforward negotiation to finalize the pact, which is seen as relatively favorable for the U.K. given the broader international trade climate.

          <p>In a U.K. first, Wales is launching a new system to provide people with coeliac disease a pre-loaded debit card to purchase gluten-free food from shops and supermarkets. This initiative offers an alternative to the current model of receiving prescribed food from a pharmacy, aiming to de-medicalize the process and give individuals more choice. While participants in a pilot program praised the convenience, some noted the monthly allowance only partially covers the higher cost of a gluten-free diet.</p>
