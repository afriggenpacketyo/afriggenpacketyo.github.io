        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tax experts suggest appealing property taxes, as many properties are over-assessed, leading to homeowners paying more than they should. Appealing involves demonstrating how the assessor incorrectly applied the assessment formula to your house, such as inaccuracies in square footage or the age of the roof. Comparing your property to neighbors' homes and checking for available tax exemptions are key steps in the appeal process. Successful appeals typically take effect for the current tax year, providing several years of savings.</p>

          <p>Japan's Defense Ministry has been urged to establish an office tasked with tackling UFOs (referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP). A cross-party group of lawmakers presented a proposal to the defense chief, describing such sightings as serious national security concerns. The group called for a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. The lawmakers also proposed regular progress reports to parliament and public information disclosure.</p>

          <p>China's military has warned that the US Space Force's plan to deploy "orbital carriers" will accelerate an arms race in space. A PLA Daily commentary pointed to a US$60 million contract awarded by the US Space Force to develop an orbital transport craft. The article said the project would “boost US war-fighting strength, yet intensify the two nations’ military rivalry and threaten space security”. The commentary cited design specifications suggesting the craft included hard-points for weapons and could carry up to 10,000kg of payload.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history and evolution of teen movies, tracing the genre from Mickey Rooney's Andy Hardy to the dystopian adventures of "The Hunger Games." The author connects the post-World War II purchasing power of baby boomers to the creation of entertainment designed for teens. While teen movies aren't as prevalent as they once were, the author argues that the entire summer movie slate is now designed with teens in mind, particularly with the rise of superhero and horror films.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's 25% tariff on imported cars has raised concerns about General Motors' (GM) future in South Korea. Unlike Hyundai and Kia, GM produces budget SUVs almost exclusively for the U.S. market, making it uniquely exposed to the tariffs. Experts suggest that the tariffs may lead GM to leave South Korea. The union says the company’s two finished car plants have been running at full capacity, with an additional 21,000 units recently allocated to the factory in Incheon, a sign that business will go on as usual for now.</p>

Some students preferred the traditional on-campus ceremony, but appreciated the grand event at the Coliseum. The event offered a do-over for USC, with Jon M.

          <p>Scientists have unraveled the mystery behind flamingos' unusual eating behavior, revealing it as a sophisticated application of fluid dynamics. The birds create vortices in the water with almost every move, including bobbing their heads and stomping their feet. The shape of their bill creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water. The study finds that flamingos' webbed toes create a pair of vortices that push food towards their bills. This research may have implications for improving water filtration technologies.</p>
