          <p>Japan's export numbers for August showed a smaller-than-anticipated decline, marking the fourth straight month of contraction in the nation's trade sector. Shipments fell by 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from the 2.6% drop recorded in July and better than the 1.9% contraction economists had forecast. This data provides a key indicator of the health of Japan's manufacturing and trade-dependent economy amid global economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, imports also contracted by 5.2%, reflecting shifts in domestic demand and global commodity prices.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region are poised for a lower open, influenced by losses on Wall Street as global investors await a crucial monetary policy decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut, a move that has significant implications for international markets and capital flows. Futures for Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 indicated losses, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index showed potential for a higher open. This cautious sentiment reflects global economic uncertainty pending the central bank's announcement.</p>

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League has reported that the teenager responsible for a recent Colorado high school shooting was an active user of a website known for hosting graphic violence and extremist content. According to the ADL, this "violent gore" site, which has been used by other school shooters, promotes white supremacist ideologies and displays real-life acts of extreme violence. Experts note that such online spaces can radicalize young individuals, making intervention more difficult. The report highlights a disturbing trend of perpetrators of violence being connected through these online platforms, raising concerns about internet radicalization.</p>

Many graduates, like Jaimee Del Piano from the University of Connecticut, are struggling to find employment despite strong academic credentials, often being told they lack sufficient experience. Career counselors advise applicants to personalize their applications and avoid using AI, as some employers view it as disingenuous. The challenging environment is forcing many young professionals to take on multiple jobs while navigating significant student debt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to make a highly anticipated decision on interest rates, with most economists predicting a cut amid conflicting economic data and political pressure. While a slowing labor market suggests a need for lower rates to stimulate hiring, rising inflation, partly driven by tariffs, presents a case for holding rates steady. The central bank must balance its dual mandate of maintaining low inflation and ensuring full employment. The outcome will have significant effects on borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, influencing everything from mortgage rates to corporate investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appreciation of Robert Redford's career highlights his deliberate choice to pursue complex, often flawed characters over simpler, heroic roles that his conventional good looks might have afforded him. The article argues that Redford consistently used his all-American image to challenge audiences and explore the underbelly of success and idealism. From political thrillers like "All the President's Men" to nuanced dramas like "The Candidate," he sidestepped easy stardom to deliver performances with depth and social commentary. His legacy is defined not just by the iconic roles he played but also by the simplistic ones he consciously rejected.</p>

In parallel, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Qatar for diplomatic talks, warning that the window of time for a negotiated peace settlement is rapidly closing.

To succeed, a public figure like Trump must meet the high legal standard of "actual malice," proving the newspaper knew the information was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.

The MPs, both doctors, were intending to observe medical and humanitarian work in the region. The UK Foreign Office has condemned the decision as "totally unacceptable," stating it is no way to treat British parliamentarians. This incident follows a similar denial of entry to two other Labour MPs earlier this year, raising concerns about Israel's restrictions on access for foreign officials critical of its policies.</p>

          <h2>Prosecutors Allege Suspect in Charlie Kirk Slaying Was Motivated by Activist's Anti-Transgender Rhetoric</h2>

          <p>Utah prosecutors have presented evidence suggesting the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk was motivated by the conservative activist's political views. Court documents reveal text messages where the suspect, Tyler Robinson, told his partner he had "enough of his hatred," specifically in the context of Kirk's anti-transgender statements made moments before the shooting. Robinson's mother reportedly told investigators her son had become more politically progressive and supportive of transgender rights, creating conflict with his family's conservative beliefs. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, citing the targeted nature of the crime based on Kirk's political expression.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, in the U.S. to help build an electric car battery plant, were detained in a large-scale immigration raid in Georgia. Several engineers told the BBC they were treated like criminals, with armed officers handcuffing them and attaching chains to their waists and ankles without explanation. They described being held in freezing conditions at a detention center with inadequate facilities. Although U.S. officials initially claimed visa violations, the workers were eventually allowed to leave voluntarily, but the incident has strained U.S.-South Korea relations and left the workers traumatized.</p>

This incident is the latest in a series of at least six similar attacks on the local protected burro population since June, prompting a non-profit rescue group to offer a significant reward for information. These wild donkeys are considered an iconic symbol of the region and even contribute to wildfire prevention by grazing on dry brush. Cupid is now stable and will join other rescued animals at a 2,000-acre sanctuary upon full recovery.</p>

A new agreement with the International Olympic Committee addresses previous concerns by improving commercial arrangements and player living conditions.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes it is unlikely that major sports teams or ownership groups will go public, despite soaring valuations. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that sports assets have historically been valued more highly as private entities, and public markets have not fully embraced them. He emphasized that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which can involve significant spending that public markets might not support. New rules allowing private equity firms to take minority stakes provide an alternative way for teams to raise capital while remaining private.</p>

In exchange, the auditor allegedly assessed substantially lower tax liabilities during multiple audits.

          <p>Dave Ricks, the CEO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, has criticized the United Kingdom's policy environment, stating the country has shifted from a leader to a "laggard" in the biopharma sector. He cited unattractive market conditions, particularly concerning drug pricing policies, as a primary reason for the company pausing plans for a new biotech incubator in the UK. Ricks warned that capital flows to where it is welcomed and that the current situation makes it difficult to consider major investments there. This serves as a cautionary tale for other nations, including the U.S., as they debate their own drug pricing regulations. (not investment advice)</p>
