          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off approximately 1,800 of its domestic employees following a Supreme Court decision that permits the Trump administration's plan to reduce the federal workforce. This move is part of a broader reorganization effort initiated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline the agency by merging or eliminating over 300 bureaus and offices. The "reduction in force" aims to align the department with the president's foreign policy objectives, with notifications to affected staff expected to be sent out imminently. The terminations are anticipated to start as early as Friday.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malaysia during the ASEAN foreign ministers' summit, marking a significant high-level engagement between the two nations. The talks come amid heightened tensions over issues including trade, Taiwan's sovereignty, and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. Wang Yi has called for a "fairer" international order, criticizing unilateral protectionism, while Rubio intends to raise concerns about China's role in global conflicts.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 22:22:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1st, escalating a trade dispute with a major U.S. partner. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the president cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl and its retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the new levy. This action is part of a broader strategy that has seen the administration send similar tariff threats to over 20 other countries. Economists have raised concerns that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts are closely watching for the release of China's first-half economic performance data, anticipating it may reveal a need for greater fiscal stimulus to counter challenges from U.S. trade policies. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% target, concerns remain about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and employment. The increasing external pressures from the ongoing trade war with the United States have prompted many economists to advocate for more proactive and forceful government support. The upcoming GDP figures will be critical in determining whether Beijing will implement more significant measures to stabilize its economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other rights groups, argues that federal agents have unlawfully targeted brown-skinned individuals, creating fear and disrupting the local economy.

          <p>Moon Tae-il, a former singer from the K-Pop group NCT, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by a Seoul court after pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault. The 31-year-old musician, along with two other men, was convicted for assaulting an intoxicated woman at a private residence in 2024. The court also ordered the men to complete a 40-hour sexual violence treatment program. Taeil's departure from the popular music group was announced in August 2024 after his agency acknowledged the seriousness of the criminal case against him.</p>

          <p>Political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans after analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. In his new book, he identifies eight words that resonate most with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. He describes these words as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies, serving as building blocks for memorable messaging. While not a guarantee of victory, he argues these words tap into instinctive voter promises, unlike highly specific slogans that may have a shorter shelf life.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult novel 'Trainspotting,' is releasing a new sequel titled 'Men in Love' that explores his famous characters' relationships immediately after the first book's events. Welsh states he was motivated to focus on love as an antidote to a world full of hate, though the characters' problematic behaviors remain. In an interview, he also expressed concern that the internet and artificial intelligence are creating a "post-culture society," making people into "dumbed down machines." He fears this trend is leading to a loss of critical thinking and a more censorious cultural environment.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, where over 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were killed, this opinion article reflects on the international community's recurring pledge of "never again." The author draws parallels between the inaction during the Bosnian war and the current crisis in Gaza, questioning how long it will take for the world to decisively act. The piece highlights the story of a Srebrenica survivor who now lives in Australia and is retraumatized by watching reports from Gaza. It critiques the cycle of witnessing suffering, delayed intervention, and hollow declarations, urging a more proactive stance against mass atrocities.</p>

The application to the Arizona Department of Transportation covers operations both with and without human safety drivers. This move signals Tesla's ambition to expand its autonomous vehicle program beyond its initial pilot in Austin, Texas, as it works to catch up with market leader Waymo, which has operated a driverless service in Phoenix since 2020. Concurrently, CEO Elon Musk has indicated that the service will likely expand to the San Francisco Bay Area within months.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing a trend of increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, with 2025 already seeing a record-warm spring and the warmest June on record for England. Climate scientists attribute this pattern to human-induced global warming, which has raised global temperatures by over 1.3°C and makes extreme heat events 3-4°C warmer in the UK. This year's heat is occurring during a neutral weather phase, unlike past record years often boosted by El Niño, indicating that global warming is now the dominant driver. Projections show this trend will continue, with hot spells becoming a more regular feature of British summers.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a surge in demand, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This boom is attributed to a generational shift where more people, including single women and couples, are seeking control over their family planning, often delaying childbirth due to social and financial pressures. While the country's birth rate remains critically low, it saw a slight increase in 2024 for the first time in nine years, offering a glimmer of hope. However, the high cost and emotional toll of IVF remain significant barriers for many.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, show that the longest and most extreme heat waves are becoming more frequent and that each fraction of a degree of warming has a compounding effect. This acceleration poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in tropical regions. The scientists stress that adaptation strategies must also accelerate to keep pace with these rapidly changing climate extremes, a task imperiled by cuts to climate research funding.</p>
