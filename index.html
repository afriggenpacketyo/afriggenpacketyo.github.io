          <p>Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected just six seconds into the NFL season opener against the Dallas Cowboys for spitting on quarterback Dak Prescott. The incident, which occurred moments after a pregame Super Bowl celebration, resulted in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Eagles. Carter, the ninth overall pick in the 2023 draft, was removed from the game before the first official play, and the Cowboys subsequently scored on their opening drive.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order giving the Department of Defense the secondary title of "Department of War," with the Defense Secretary also to be known as Secretary of War. This move aims to project a message of strength and readiness, reverting to the name used until after World War II. While a permanent legal name change requires congressional approval, the executive action authorizes the immediate use of the new titles in official communications.</p>

Monarez maintains she was fired for resisting pressure to pre-approve vaccine recommendations and fire career officials, which she believed contradicted scientific evidence.

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has intensified as independent candidate Andrew Cuomo challenged Democrat Zohran Mamdani to a series of debates, urging other candidates to drop out. In response, Mamdani bypassed Cuomo and challenged President Trump directly to a debate, framing Cuomo as a puppet of the administration. This comes amid reports that the White House is trying to engineer a two-person race, an idea that incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa have both rejected.</p>

The party's success is attributed to its consolidation of the Brexit-supporting vote, tapping into widespread dissatisfaction with the economy, NHS, and immigration. Led by Nigel Farage, Reform's future hinges on its ability to maintain this support and navigate a fragmented political landscape where 31% of the vote could be enough to win.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has released her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," which explores her turbulent and complex relationship with her late mother, Mary Roy. The book provides a raw account of Mary Roy, a feminist icon and educator who was both a source of shelter and storm for her daughter. Roy describes the memoir not as a traditional biography but as a "reportage of the heart," detailing a bond between two strong-willed individuals that ultimately shaped her as a writer.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense bipartisan questioning during a fiery Senate hearing regarding recent turmoil at the CDC and his vaccine policies.

          <p>The debate over vaccine policy in the U.S. has evolved into a proxy war over trust, freedom, and the government's role in public health, creating a deep ideological divide. Under Health Secretary Robert F.

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal battle over presidential power by asking the Supreme Court to permit the removal of Democratic Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. Lower courts have blocked Trump's attempt to fire her, citing federal laws that protect commissioners at independent regulatory agencies from being removed without cause to ensure their independence. The administration argues that the modern FTC wields substantial executive power, and therefore its members should serve at the president's will.</p>
