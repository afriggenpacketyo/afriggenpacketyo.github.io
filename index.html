          <p>Iran has stated that an Israeli airstrike on Tehran's Evin Prison resulted in 71 fatalities, a claim emerging amid a fragile ceasefire. In a separate development, the Israeli military has ordered evacuations in northern Gaza as it intensifies its operations against Hamas. The article also touches on related geopolitical events, including former U.S. President Trump's support for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and diplomatic efforts by Qatar to leverage the Iran-Israel truce for a Gaza ceasefire.

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential bomb in a matter of months. This assessment contradicts claims by former President Trump that Iran's nuclear facilities were completely destroyed by recent US and Israeli strikes. Grossi emphasized that while the damage was severe, Iran's industrial and technological capabilities remain, underscoring the need for a diplomatic solution to the ongoing nuclear standoff. The article notes Iran has given conflicting reports on the extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>The recent killing of 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf in Pakistan has intensified concerns about the safety of women who maintain a public presence on social media.

Interviews with several Pakistani women reveal a pattern of online harassment rooted in patriarchal norms, where female self-expression is often viewed as a threat to cultural values.

          <p>After a six-year legal process, a jury found Samuel Woodward guilty of the first-degree murder of his former high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein, with an added hate crime enhancement. The article details the 2018 murder, where Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student, was stabbed to death. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, a member of a neo-Nazi group, was motivated by hate, while the defense unsuccessfully claimed Woodward was provoked. Bernstein's parents have since started a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward" to honor their son's legacy.</p>

          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The French state recently became the largest shareholder with a â‚¬1.35 billion investment, positioning Eutelsat as a strategic asset for Europe's technological sovereignty. However, experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing Starlink's vastly larger satellite constellation and launch capabilities. Eutelsat is seen as better positioned to serve security-sensitive government and enterprise markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a small island group administered by Taipei but located just miles from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, it has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. An on-the-ground report from the island reveals the distinct limitations both Beijing and Taipei face in exerting their influence there. While Taipei still promotes it as a symbol of its governance, the island's unique position highlights the complex and often indirect nature of the power dynamics across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>Five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. This move is part of a plan to bolster border security against a potential Russian attack by creating an explosive "Iron Curtain." The strategy involves producing and storing mines for rapid deployment in an emergency, aiming to create a significant deterrent. The plan is controversial due to the long-term danger mines pose to civilians, but the nations involved cite an "existential threat" from Russia.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. While the events maintain a celebratory atmosphere, organizers state this year's marches will adopt a more defiant and protest-oriented tone. This shift comes in response to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender individuals, and a notable decrease in corporate sponsorships for Pride events. The theme for New York's march is "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," reflecting the community's current mood.</p>

This shift in lifestyle is a response to the ever-present risk of being caught in anti-corruption or austerity sweeps, which can be unpredictable and stricter at the local level, prompting officials to adopt more cautious personal habits.</p>

          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island" phenomenon, which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. This effect is driven by dark surfaces like roads and buildings that absorb and retain the sun's heat, which is then slowly released, especially overnight. The lack of vegetation and water, combined with waste heat from human activities like air conditioning, exacerbates the problem, making urban populations more vulnerable to heat-related health risks. With climate change making heatwaves more intense, cities will bear the brunt of extreme temperatures.</p>
