          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war has commenced with further strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility, accompanied by a warning from Iran against U.S. intervention. Israel has targeted centrifuge production sites and killed senior Iranian commanders, including one allegedly involved in the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Iran retaliated with drones and missiles, causing light injuries to U.S. citizens in Israel, prompting the U.S. to assist in evacuating Americans. President Trump is weighing military intervention, while B-2 stealth bombers are being deployed to Guam, potentially signaling a show of force or preparation for strikes on Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights for American citizens from Israel, following days of uncertainty regarding government assistance for evacuations. Two flights have already departed from Tel Aviv to Athens, carrying approximately 70 U.S. citizens and their families, with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee encouraging other citizens needing assistance to register with the State Department. This action comes amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, which have resulted in casualties on both sides and the closure of Ben Gurion International Airport.

          <p>Amidst the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, the U.S. has deployed B-2 stealth bombers to Guam, potentially en route to Diego Garcia, a U.S. base in the Indian Ocean. These bombers are capable of carrying 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, which could be used to destroy Iran's Fordow nuclear site. The deployment signifies a strategic move to position military assets closer to Iran, although the specific purpose of the deployment remains unclear. Experts suggest that an attack on Fordow is more likely to be launched from Diego Garcia due to its proximity to Iran.</p>

          <p>Haji Wright, a forward for the United States national team, will be sidelined for the rest of the Concacaf Gold Cup due to an Achilles injury. The 27-year-old scored in the opening match against Trinidad and Tobago but will now return to Coventry City for treatment. Coach Mauricio Pochettino expressed concern about the injury, which Wright apparently had before the tournament, and is unsure if midfielders Tyler Adams and Johnny Cardoso will be healthy enough to start in the upcoming game. In addition, Pochettino voiced his hope that the national team would receive a White House invitation.</p>

          <p>Japan has repatriated the remains of 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the country's first such repatriation. The remains, taken in the 19th and 20th centuries, were held by three Japanese research institutions and were returned following a survey by Japan's education ministry at Australia's request. This repatriation aligns with a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad for research or collection. Australia has been working for over 30 years to secure the return of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remains, repatriating over 1,785 sets from overseas collections.</p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) has nearly five times more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee (DNC), with $72 million compared to $15 million, marking the widest disparity since at least July 2020. This financial edge could provide the GOP with an early boost as it prepares for next year's midterms. The DNC has faced internal tension since President Trump's return to the White House, with some Democrats expressing concerns about the party's direction. However, the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, raising approximately $40 million in individual donations since February.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed has criticized President Trump for dismissing his intelligence chief, suggesting that Trump is disavowing the intelligence community for political reasons. Reed's comments come after National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Trump has stated that Gabbard and the intelligence community are "wrong," leading Reed to speculate that Trump's stance is related to a potential attack against Iran. Reed also stated that if Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, there would be an obligation to correct the record immediately.</p>
