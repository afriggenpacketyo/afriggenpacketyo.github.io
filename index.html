          <h2>Reciprocal Tariffs: Trump's Trade Policy and its Economic Ramifications</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's planned "Liberation Day" import tax blitz includes reciprocal tariffs, aiming to match tariffs imposed by other countries on US imports.  Economists warn that this tit-for-tat approach could complicate global commerce and increase costs for US consumers and businesses. The administrative complexity of implementing truly reciprocal tariffs across all product categories is significant, potentially leading to country-specific rates instead.</p>

          <p>China's HL-3 tokamak reactor achieved a plasma state with ion and electron temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius, a significant milestone in nuclear fusion research.  This achievement represents a major leap in fusion performance and marks China's entry into the burning plasma phase. The success is attributed to a fully domestically developed suite of heating, control, and diagnostic systems. The research involves international collaboration through the ITER project.</p>

          <p>Economists predict Slovakia will be most severely impacted by President Trump's new auto tariffs, despite Germany having the highest value of car exports affected.  Slovakia's high volume of US auto exports makes it particularly vulnerable to the 25% tariff.  Germany's automotive industry, with major players like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes, will also experience significant negative effects. The tariffs are part of Trump's broader plan to rebalance the US economy.</p>
