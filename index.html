          <p>Design software company Figma experienced a 13% drop in its stock price following its first earnings report since its initial public offering. While the company reported a 41% year-over-year increase in revenue, narrowly beating expectations, its forecast for the upcoming quarter appeared to underwhelm investors. The report also detailed Figma's investments in new AI-driven design tools and recent acquisitions of startups Modyfi and Payload. CEO Dylan Field expressed confidence that AI will ultimately augment the role of designers, despite some market concerns about the technology's potential to displace jobs in the sector.

          <p>Key Republican senators on the Senate Banking Committee have stated they will not consider a replacement for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook until her lawsuit is resolved. Cook is legally challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her over allegations her lawyer denies, creating a significant legal and political standoff. Senators Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis emphasized that Cook has not yet had due process and that her status on the board remains unchanged. Their stance creates a hurdle for the administration, as Republican unanimity on the committee is necessary to advance any new nominee for the central bank role.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares declined after the company issued a weak revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, overshadowing its better-than-expected earnings results. Although the enterprise software giant surpassed revenue and earnings estimates for the second quarter, its guidance for the third quarter fell slightly short of analyst expectations. The company has faced investor skepticism this year due to slow revenue growth, lagging behind other major tech companies that have benefited from the AI boom.

          <p>President Trump labeled the ongoing efforts to release all government files related to Jeffrey Epstein as an 'irrelevant' and a 'Democrat hoax.' His comments came as survivors of Epstein's abuse held a press conference at the Capitol, urging for full transparency and sharing harrowing accounts of their experiences. One survivor, a registered Republican, directly invited the president to meet with them to understand the reality of their trauma. The push is being led by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who are using a procedural tool to force a vote on the matter, despite opposition from House leadership.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended a recent U.S. military strike against a Venezuelan drug cartel vessel, signaling a significant shift in U.S. policy towards narco-terrorism. Rubio stated that the previous 'seize and apprehend' strategy was ineffective and that the U.S. will no longer 'sit back' and allow these groups to operate freely in the Caribbean. The strike, which reportedly killed 11 members of the Tren de Aragua gang, reflects a more aggressive stance authorized by President Trump.

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced plans to make Florida the first state to end all childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance. The move, which would eliminate long-standing requirements for vaccines against diseases like measles and polio, was framed as a measure to protect parental rights and medical freedom. The announcement drew immediate and sharp criticism from medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warned of a potential public health disaster and the resurgence of preventable diseases.

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters soared over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations and re-issued positive full-year guidance. The company credited its success to recent marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL player Travis Kelce, which it said drove an uptick in customer engagement and sales. Despite some controversy surrounding the slogans, the campaigns led to product sellouts and the acquisition of 700,000 new customers. The strong performance marks a turnaround for the retailer, which had previously struggled with merchandising missteps and economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Aspiration was partially funded by a $50 million investment from Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, though the team states it was unaware of any improper activity.

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have discovered the remains of a unique armored dinosaur, named Spicomellus, that lived over 165 million years ago. The herbivore, roughly the size of a small car, possessed an extraordinary defense system, including three-foot-long spikes on its neck and ribs fused with outward-projecting spikes, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these dinosaurs developed elaborate armor much earlier than previously thought. Scientists believe the complex armor was likely used for both defense against predators and for attracting mates or deterring rivals.</p>

          <p>City planners in Anaheim are considering a gondola system as a potential transit solution to connect Angel Stadium and the Honda Center with the Disneyland and Anaheim Convention Center area. The proposal is one of several futuristic transit options being explored to manage increased traffic from major development projects like the expansion of Disney's theme parks and the new OC Vibe entertainment district. A preliminary study commissioned by the city from a gondola company pitched creative ideas, such as designing support towers to resemble the stadium's iconic 'Big A' landmark. The city is still in the early stages of evaluating various technologies.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.4 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize. While the odds of winning are astronomical, the tax implications vary widely by state. Winners in states with no income tax, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest payout after federal taxes are withheld. In contrast, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the annuitized payout reduced by over $140 million. The data also identifies the most and least frequently drawn numbers in recent drawings.</p>

          <p>A new cryptocurrency venture co-founded by President Trump and his sons, World Liberty Financial, has launched publicly, creating what critics describe as a direct new avenue for entities to curry favor with the president. The launch of the '$WLFI' token highlights ongoing concerns about the Trump family personally profiting from the presidency, especially given the administration's recent shift to a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance. While the family's holdings are currently restricted from being sold, ethics experts and political opponents argue that the venture creates a clear conflict of interest, which the White House has repeatedly denied.</p>

In late-stage trials, the pill demonstrated weight loss of up to 16.6%, comparable to the injectable version, and a favorable safety profile. The development of an effective pill could help alleviate supply shortages of injectable treatments and potentially offer a more accessible and convenient option for patients managing chronic weight issues.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has filed a federal lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the dominant conservative media outlet of engaging in anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly over the right-leaning news market. The lawsuit alleges that Fox News uses its market power to coerce pay-TV distributors into restrictive agreements that marginalize or exclude rival channels like Newsmax. Newsmax claims these practices have suppressed its growth, limited its distribution, and ultimately harmed consumers by inflating carriage fees. Fox News dismissed the lawsuit, stating that Newsmax's struggles are due to its own competitive failures and inability to attract viewers.</p>

          <p>A new survey from PwC forecasts that Americans will cut their holiday spending by an average of 5% this year, the most significant decrease since 2020. Consumers are expected to spend an average of $1,552 on gifts, travel, and entertainment, down from the previous year, as they grapple with high prices and economic uncertainty. The Gen Z demographic is projected to reduce its budget most sharply, by 23%, due to a challenging job market and rising costs. This anticipated pullback in spending could pose a challenge for retailers who rely heavily on the holiday season for a large portion of their annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court found that the current situation does not meet the law's requirement of an 'invasion or predatory incursion,' thereby blocking its application in this context. The administration had invoked the obscure wartime statute to remove hundreds of alleged Tren de Aragua members. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy and a victory for civil liberties groups who argued the president was overreaching his authority.</p>
