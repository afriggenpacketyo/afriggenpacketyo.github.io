          <p>A mega-bill encompassing President Trump's legislative agenda faces potential derailment as several Republican hard-liners express opposition, citing concerns about the national debt. Representative Ralph Norman indicated he would vote against the bill, and other Republicans are expected to follow suit, jeopardizing its advancement from the House Budget Committee. House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to sway holdouts and address concerns related to Medicaid and tax reform. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a 1,116-page document, aims to pass in a deficit-neutral way, though some remain skeptical. Optimism about the bill's passage remains uncertain as negotiations continue.</p>

Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, driven by online advertising and its third-party marketplace.

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly relying on officials holding multiple positions, raising concerns about potential dysfunction and conflicts of interest. Several key roles are being filled by acting officials, and some individuals are juggling multiple responsibilities, such as Marco Rubio serving as both Secretary of State and acting administrator of USAID. This practice reflects the administration's struggle to find qualified individuals willing to fill these roles and raises questions about the effectiveness and integrity of government operations.

The temporary nature of the tariff reduction and the possibility of future increases continue to create instability and hinder investment decisions.

Justices across the ideological spectrum questioned the authority of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions and considered the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself. The US solicitor general argued for curtailing lower courts' power, while opponents argued that siding with Trump would create a chaotic, patchwork system of citizenship.

While the show aims to create a party vibe, some viewers miss a deeper sense of sentimentality and emotional complexity.

          <p>Social Security recipients are unlikely to receive a tax break on their benefits despite President Trump's earlier promise, as the Republican-backed legislation excludes such a provision. The exclusion stems from restrictions on making changes to Social Security through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill includes a new $4,000 deduction for senior citizens, which could lower taxes for some. Eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the program's long-term fiscal outlook, potentially leading to benefit cuts.</p>

          <p>The full retirement age for Social Security benefits is increasing, meaning Americans born in 1960 will need to work until age 67 to receive their full benefits.

While workers can still retire early at 62, they will face a reduction in their monthly benefit. Working past the full retirement age increases monthly payments. This increase to age 67 is the last scheduled increase under the 1983 amendments, though further changes could be made in the future.</p>
