          <p>Chinese officials have stated that the upcoming trade meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart was requested by the U.S. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian emphasized China's opposition to U.S. tariff hikes and willingness to engage in dialogue based on equality, respect, and mutual benefit. This statement sets the stage for high-stakes negotiations aimed at resolving the tariff war initiated by President Donald Trump, who has previously asserted America's upper hand due to China's reliance on American consumers. China faces a blanket tariff rate of 145% on goods bound for the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal judges in New York and Colorado have blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act, arguing that the administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion, or predatory incursion. The rulings came in response to President Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants allegedly linked to the gang Tren de Aragua. The judges emphasized that migrants are still subject to removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, but the Alien Enemies Act was improperly invoked. The judges' decisions cited the lack of due process and the potential for abuse and inhumane treatment if migrants were deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport migrants without legal status to Libya, a country plagued by armed conflict and human rights concerns. This plan follows reports that the administration is considering other African countries with questionable human rights records, such as Benin, Angola, and Eswatini, as destinations for deportees. The deportations to Libya are expected to be carried out by the U.S. military. The administration has been seeking to deport migrants to third countries as part of its crackdown on immigration.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has re-entered the public sphere with strong criticisms of President Trump's foreign policy and a defense of his own record. In an interview with the BBC, Biden attacked Trump's handling of the war in Ukraine and his dealings with global allies. He also defended his decision to seek re-election, despite Democratic losses. Biden's remarks signal a continuing public role, even as many Democrats blame him for their 2024 defeat.</p>
