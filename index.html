        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports increasing adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps, but stresses the need for further progress to meet net-zero targets. While electric car sales are rising and expected to reach price parity with petrol cars soon, heat pump adoption lags behind targets despite recent growth. The committee highlights the importance of making electricity more affordable for households to incentivize the switch to cleaner technologies. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband acknowledges the advice and reiterates the government's commitment to lowering energy bills by becoming a clean energy superpower. Optimism surrounds the achievability of net-zero by 2050, with greenhouse gas emissions already significantly reduced since 1990.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened ICE activity in Los Angeles, Regina Higuera, who lived in the U.S. for 36 years, chose to self-deport to Mexico to avoid the uncertainty of potential ICE encounters. Her daughter, Julie Ear, explained that her mother wanted control over her life rather than facing possible deportation from her home or job. Higuera, who worked in garment factories and contributed to the economy by paying taxes, had crossed into the U.S. illegally at age 15. Now reunited with her mother in Mexico, Higuera expresses happiness at being free from stress but misses her family in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary showcases the ideological divide within the party, pitting left-wing candidate Zohran Mamdani against moderate Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, advocates for affordability measures like free public transportation and universal childcare, attracting support from young and progressive voters. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback, emphasizes experience and competence, appealing to older voters and black voters. The race is seen as a proxy war between the left and moderate factions within the Democratic Party. The outcome of the primary could signal the direction of the party as it seeks to challenge Trump.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a partial injunction against the Trump administration, preventing it from withholding funds previously allocated to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The lawsuit, led by attorneys general in California, Colorado, and Washington, argued that the administration's actions violated congressional intent. Judge Tana Lin ruled that the states were likely to succeed in their lawsuit, asserting that the administration's reasoning was insufficient to override congressional intent. The Trump administration had previously suspended approval of state electric vehicle infrastructure deployment plans, citing a need to review underlying policies.</p>

According to a diver with the Stockton-based Angels Recovery Dive Team, Creus hesitated before jumping, and Schoenecker and Anthony attempted to save him when he got into trouble.

          <p>Adam Christopher Sheafe confessed to the religiously motivated murder of Pastor William Schonemann in Arizona, claiming it was part of a divine mission to punish religious leaders he believed were misleading followers.

After killing Schonemann, Sheafe traveled to Sedona with plans to murder two more religious leaders, but he was apprehended after a high-speed chase.

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, providing insights into how new stars are born. Analyzing data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time, offering a new perspective on the Milky Way's history.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, not completely destroying it. The Defense Intelligence Agency found that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, with the resumption of the program depending on the time it takes to clear the entrances and repair infrastructure. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House disputes the assessment, calling it "flat-out wrong," while others stand by the claim that the strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>A presentation intended for CDC advisers cited a nonexistent study to support claims about the risks of the vaccine preservative thimerosal. The presentation, scheduled to be given by Lyn Redwood, referenced a study that Dr. Robert F. Berman, the supposed author, confirmed did not exist. The citation was removed from the presentation after it was flagged, but the incident has raised concerns about the integrity of information being presented to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. The controversy is compounded by recent changes to the committee's membership and ongoing debates about vaccine safety.</p>

          <p>China is implementing measures to encourage foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance as international confidence in the greenback weakens. The People's Bank of China is planning to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promote yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Recent moves include expanding tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and a relatively opaque system have discouraged large-scale investment. (not investment advice)</p>

Paola, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. as a minor seeking asylum, was detained during a green card application meeting due to a deportation order issued in 2018 when her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing. Adrian Clouatre expressed his frustration, stating that his wife is being made to pay for her mother's actions and that ICE should have more discretion. The couple has filed a motion to reopen the case, but the situation highlights the strict immigrant enforcement policies of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs informed a judge that he would not testify in his sex trafficking trial, which is expected to conclude this week. The decision came after prosecutors rested their case, having called 34 witnesses over 28 days to argue that Combs used his empire to coerce women into sexual activity. Combs' lawyers presented a brief defense, arguing that the alleged victims consented to the activities. The defense rested its case after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal, but the judge reserved the decision.
