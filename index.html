        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Upon reaching the historic milestone of 3,000 career strikeouts, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has reignited the debate over who is the franchise's greatest pitcher. This article argues that Kershaw's sustained excellence and longevity over 18 seasons give him an edge over the legendary Sandy Koufax, whose peak dominance was brilliant but brief. While acknowledging Koufax's superior postseason record, the piece emphasizes Kershaw's higher totals in wins, strikeouts, and innings pitched as evidence of his enduring impact. The achievement solidifies a legacy built on consistent professionalism and performance, making a powerful case for his place as the team's all-time best.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to gather enough votes to pass President Trump's major domestic policy and tax-cut bill ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline. A crucial procedural vote was held open late into the night as leadership scrambled to persuade several GOP holdouts from both the moderate and conservative wings of the party. These members are dissatisfied with changes made to the bill in the Senate, particularly regarding Medicaid cuts and the debt limit. The narrow Republican majority means they can afford very few defections, leaving the bill's passage uncertain.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. House of Representatives operating with a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become a relevant concern. This article explains the chamber's procedure for such an event, noting that unlike the Senate, the House has no tie-breaking mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote is tied, the question or measure being voted on is automatically defeated. This procedural reality underscores the high stakes of party unity on closely contested bills, such as the recent vote on President Trump's domestic spending package.</p>

          <p>A piece of a wing flap that fell from a Delta Air Lines jet was discovered in the driveway of a home in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Boeing 737, carrying 109 passengers and six crew members, had departed from Atlanta and landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport before the missing part was observed during a post-flight inspection. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the part belonged to the aircraft and has launched an investigation into the incident. No injuries were reported on the flight or on the ground.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that severely restricted the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president does not have the authority to unilaterally "adopt an alternative immigration system" that supplants laws passed by Congress. The judge granted a nationwide injunction against the policy but stayed his decision for 14 days, allowing the administration time to appeal the ruling and prepare for its implementation.</p>

Firefighting efforts have been significantly reinforced with personnel and equipment from across Greece, but crews face extreme difficulty due to the rugged terrain, dry conditions, and thick smoke that has engulfed the region.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on the Federal Reserve, calling for its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign immediately. In a social media post, Trump criticized Powell's handling of interest rates, arguing they should be cut to stimulate economic growth. Trump nominated Powell during his presidency but has since become a frequent critic of his policies. The demand challenges the traditional independence of the central bank, as Fed board members can typically only be removed "for cause" before their term expires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An official UK watchdog has found that police investigations into historical child grooming cases in Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence. The report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services noted that some documents had only a few words visible, making them impossible to assess. While the council cited complex data-sharing rules, the watchdog stated the practice affected major operations. A new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted information has since been agreed upon by all parties.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms could increase breast cancer risk. The research found that for women under 55 who still have a uterus, using a combination of estrogen and progestin was associated with a higher risk. In contrast, for women without a uterus who can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce breast cancer risk. The findings underscore that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors for patients and doctors to consider.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former PhD criminology student accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, has pleaded guilty to the murders in a deal to avoid the death penalty. Kohberger admitted to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary during a court hearing, waiving his right to appeal. He is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences. The brutal nature of the stabbings shocked the small college town of Moscow, and the plea deal has elicited divided reactions from the victims' families.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study indicates a significant political shift, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a substantial jump from his 36% share in 2020. Political analysts cited in this article suggest this trend is less about a move toward traditional conservatism and more about a rise in economic populism. They argue that many Latino voters, particularly naturalized citizens, are motivated by economic concerns and feel disillusioned with the Democratic Party's messaging and policies on issues like immigration.</p>

This evaluation indicates a significant degradation of Iran's capabilities, particularly through the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The assessment provides a more measured timeframe than President Trump's initial claims of complete obliteration but still points to a substantial delay in Iran's ability to produce enriched uranium.</p>
