          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have agreed to a deal aimed at resetting their relationship following Britain's exit from the bloc in 2020. The agreement, reached during a summit in London, includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, cooperation on energy and security, and a youth mobility scheme to facilitate work, study, and travel for young people. The deal also addresses irregular migration challenges and explores the use of e-gates for UK passport holders at European airports.

          <p>As Britain and the European Union hold their first summit since Brexit, analysts suggest it's less like a reunion and more like exes working together for the sake of their children. This NPR article explores the complexities of the post-Brexit relationship, noting that while many Britons regret leaving the EU, there is little appetite for reversing the decision. The article highlights that the summit focuses on smaller-scale issues such as fishing rights and student mobility, while larger issues like the single market and freedom of movement remain off the table. The geopolitical landscape, including the war in Ukraine and the Trump administration, is driving renewed cooperation between the UK and EU.</p>
