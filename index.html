          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, ending days of escalating conflict. President Trump announced the agreement, attributing it to U.S.-brokered talks, though Indian officials suggest it was a direct agreement between the two countries. Pakistan's Prime Minister Sharif thanked Trump for his proactive role in achieving regional peace and stability. The ceasefire began at 5 p.m. local time, but explosions were later reported in Indian-controlled Kashmir, with local officials reporting fighting in Srinagar and air defense units being activated.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly woman in Sonoma County out of $1 million. Cohen-Roth gained the victim's trust while preparing her taxes and offered her fraudulent 'investment opportunities' promising high returns with no risk. The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth running a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones while funding a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute when the scheme collapsed in 2020 after demanding her money back.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy as weight loss injections like Mounjaro gain popularity, leading to a loss of over a million members. The article explores how these injections, which mimic the GLP-1 hormone to suppress appetite, are impacting the diet industry. While WeightWatchers emphasizes its holistic approach and scientific backing, some experts caution against relying solely on medication for long-term weight management. They argue that understanding the psychological reasons behind overeating is crucial for sustained weight loss and overall wellbeing, as weight loss injections may not be a quick fix.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying over President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with key issues and potential impacts on Americans under scrutiny. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill, but the final version is subject to change. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through a process known as 'reconciliation,' which requires navigating a limited budget framework. Experts anticipate challenges due to competing priorities and the need for a fiscally responsible package.</p>

The plans include time-limited work visas for jobs not requiring graduate-level skills, stricter English language requirements, and potential loss of sponsorship rights for companies failing to prioritize UK-based staff. The proposals also seek to change how judges interpret Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. The goal is to link the immigration system more closely to the labor market, incentivizing employers to prioritize domestic workers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, siding with a group of unions, non-profits, and local governments. The judge ruled that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring, blocking mass layoffs known as 'reductions in force' for 14 days. The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk's 'department of government efficiency' (Doge). A hearing is scheduled to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.</p>
