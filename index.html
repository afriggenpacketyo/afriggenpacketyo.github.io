          <p>U2 is back in the studio after an eight-year hiatus, prompted by drummer Larry Mullen Jr.'s recovery from neck surgery. The band members discussed their recent writing sessions, emphasizing the unique chemistry they rediscovered in creating new music using just bass, drums, guitar, and vocals. Bono noted that this traditional setup feels like an original idea in 2025. They reflected on their career, including stadium tours and revisiting past hits, but expressed their primary interest in creating the 'sound of the future,' which they believe is theirs to make. The band received fellowship of the Ivors' songwriting academy.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala at his Virginia golf club for the highest-paying investors of his $TRUMP memecoin, sparking controversy and raising ethical questions. Protesters gathered outside, criticizing the event as a display of corruption, while attendees, including crypto mogul Justin Sun, expressed their intent to influence U.S. financial regulations. Trump promised to support the crypto industry, despite concerns that the event was arranged to directly enrich his family, who profit from transaction fees of the memecoin. Senator Jeff Merkley decried the event as 'the Mount Everest of corruption,' while the White House defended Trump's actions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass' public safety initiatives to avoid city worker layoffs. The budget reduces funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than since 1995, and scales back new hires for the Fire Department. Council members voiced concerns over public safety cuts, while others defended the budget as promoting equity and inclusion. The plan aims to avert about 700 city employee layoffs through potential union concessions and tapping into budget stabilization funds.</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard University face uncertainty after the Trump administration revoked the university's permission to enroll them. This decision, affecting over a quarter of the student body, has caused fear and confusion as students worry about their degrees and futures. The action is seen as retaliation for Harvard's refusal to change its hiring and admissions practices. Students are considering transferring to other universities, and professors fear this will destroy the university as they know it.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to block Harvard from enrolling international students by revoking its certification to use SEVIS, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. This system is essential for managing and tracking international students' enrollment. Without SEVIS access, Harvard cannot verify students' visa compliance, potentially leading to their deportation. The move is seen as an escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to align with its agenda. The university could challenge the decision in court.</p>

Services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which runs near the loop line, also resumed with delays. The Yamanote Line's outer loop was previously canceled Thursday night due to the pantograph issues.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has detected cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, through airport screening programs. Cases have been reported in international travelers arriving in multiple states. The variant is dominant in China and rising in Asia, prompting health authorities to urge masking and stockpile resources. Preliminary data suggests the variant may be more transmissible, leading the FDA to consider updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming season. Experts note a more predictable pattern in COVID-19 trends despite the new variant.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a policy providing basic rights and protections to child immigrants in custody. The agreement limits detention time and requires adequate food, water, and clean clothes for children. The Justice Department argues that the agreement incentivizes unauthorized border crossings and prevents effective family detention and removal. Critics argue this move disregards the rule of law and the well-being of vulnerable children. The administration previously failed to dissolve the agreement in 2019.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rose to 3.5% in April, the highest level in over two years, driven by surging rice prices. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing rate hikes to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and yen appreciation. Potential oversupply from U.S. tariffs and government subsidies may further reduce inflation.</p>
