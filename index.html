          <p>Amid rising geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, wealthy mainland Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their capital away from U.S. real estate towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. In 2024, these countries became the top choices for Chinese buyers seeking homes costing over US$5 million, a shift from 2023 when the U.S. was the preferred destination. Factors such as geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals have discouraged some buyers, leading them to seek friendlier alternatives.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. The program provides families with $10,000 per year, with up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, and will cover up to 90,000 students in its first year. Supporters say it will give parents more educational options, while critics argue it will divert resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families.

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift towards a royal court dynamic in his second term. Unlike his first term, where Trump had to navigate a coalition government and advisors who sometimes curbed his impulses, Klein posits that Trump's second term would be characterized by loyalists and enforcers, ensuring that his decisions faced little resistance. This structure, Klein suggests, removes the guardrails that previously tempered Trump's actions, leading to a more reckless and unrestrained presidency.</p>

While purchased passports are now ruled out, 'golden visas' offering residence permits for real estate purchases or other major investments remain a concern, with the European Commission emphasizing the need for stricter monitoring and due diligence to mitigate security and corruption risks.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform UK, is presenting a serious challenge to the governing Labour Party and the opposition Conservatives, gaining traction in local elections. With surging support for Reform and gains for other small parties, the traditional two-party system in Britain is under pressure. The results reflect a breakdown of traditional class loyalties among voters and increasing support for nationalist politics. The article explores the potential implications for both Labour and the Conservatives, as well as the broader political landscape in Britain.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is facing a growing crisis amid a surge in recall petitions led by supporters of Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te. The KMT has seen dozens of local officials arrested for allegedly forging documents in counter-recall efforts, and prosecutors have raided KMT local chapter headquarters across the island. The opposition coalition, holding a narrow legislative majority, has faced criticism for obstructing the Lai administration, sparking concern from the United States and its allies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam is causing anxiety among factory workers and exporters, threatening Vietnam's manufacturing-driven economy. The pause in tariffs provides only temporary relief as the prospect of reinstatement is already affecting economic growth, with some American retailers canceling orders and factories cutting jobs. The article discusses the potential impact on Vietnamese garment manufacturers, who rely heavily on U.S. demand, and the efforts to diversify markets and negotiate with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, throwing the broadcaster's future into disarray. The publicly funded broadcaster had fallen silent after an executive order by former US President Donald Trump effectively gutted the network. The appeals court ruled that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to order the VOA employees to return to work, with one judge dissenting and warning that the networks will likely cease to exist in any meaningful form by the time the case is fully adjudicated.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships have chosen not to legally marry due to the requirement to adopt the same surname, a law unique to Japan. The survey found that the rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% indicating they would marry if separate surnames were allowed. Conservative members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party oppose changing the law, citing concerns about traditional family values. The survey estimates that over half a million people would marry if separate surnames were an option.</p>
