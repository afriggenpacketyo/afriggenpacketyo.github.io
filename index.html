          <p>Financial experts are weighing the pros and cons of 10-year certificates of deposit (CDs) amid fluctuating interest rates. While these long-term CDs can lock in current high rates as a hedge against future decreases by the Federal Reserve, they often offer lower returns than shorter-term options or other investments like stocks. Experts advise that 10-year CDs may suit risk-averse savers with long-term goals who won't need immediate access to their funds, but others might find better growth potential elsewhere.

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.7% annually in June, the highest level recorded since February, signaling a slight acceleration in inflation. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.3%, driven by factors including potential impacts from tariffs on imported goods. While core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 2.9%, specific items like eggs and ground beef saw significant price jumps, indicating persistent cost-of-living pressures for consumers.

          <p>A recently signed tax-and-spending bill extends previous tax cuts and introduces notable changes affecting charitable deductions and university endowments. The legislation alters the tax rates for university endowments based on their size, potentially impacting the financial strategies of about 15 top research institutions. It also modifies rules for charitable giving, limiting deductions for high-income earners while aiming to encourage more donations from the general public, with the CBO estimating it could add trillions to the deficit.

          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst predictions, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank reported earnings of $1.96 per share on revenue of $21.67 billion, benefiting from market volatility that boosted trading profits. Despite the strong performance and an increased full-year revenue forecast, the bank also noted a 16% rise in the cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has largely exonerated the German government in a case concerning its role in a 2012 U.S. drone strike in Yemen that utilized the Ramstein air base. While dismissing the specific lawsuit, the court affirmed that Germany has a duty to protect human rights abroad when there is a sufficient connection to German state authority. The ruling grants the government considerable leeway in foreign and security policy but establishes a precedent for future scrutiny of its involvement in international military operations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump Administration's Stance on Russia is Evolving</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that President Trump's position on Russia and the conflict in Ukraine is shifting to become more confrontational, aligning more closely with traditional U.S. foreign policy. Recent statements threatening tariffs and promising continued weapons shipments to Ukraine indicate a departure from his past rhetoric, which critics often viewed as sympathetic to Vladimir Putin. This evolution is occurring despite the presence of "post-liberal" figures like J.D. Vance in his circle, suggesting a pragmatic awakening to the reality of strategic rivalry with Russia.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has bombed Syrian government forces as they were deploying to the predominantly Druze city of Suweida, following deadly sectarian clashes in the area. The fighting between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes reportedly resulted in about 100 deaths before Syrian forces intervened to enforce a ceasefire. Israel stated the strikes were ordered to prevent the Syrian government from using its weaponry against the Druze population, citing a commitment to protecting the minority group with whom Israeli Druze have deep ties.</p>

The initiative will involve banks sending investment offers to savers and a public advertising campaign to raise awareness, as part of broader reforms to boost the UK's financial services sector. The proposals also include a review of risk warnings on investment products and making a low-deposit mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 70 other structures on the canyon's North Rim, prompting scrutiny of the National Park Service's initial handling of the blaze. The fire, ignited by lightning on July 4, was initially allowed to burn for management purposes before high winds and dry conditions caused it to erupt, forcing immediate evacuations. Arizona's governor has called for a federal investigation into the decision-making process, as the fire continues to burn with no containment, leading to the closure of the North Rim for the year.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report, which lists top earners like Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball, does not provide a complete picture of what the corporation's biggest stars earn. Many high-profile presenters and actors are not included because they are employed by independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios, rather than directly by the license-fee-funded part of the organization. This arrangement means the salaries of stars from major shows like "Strictly Come Dancing," "The Traitors," and numerous popular dramas remain undisclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>A review of Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," examines how the author blurs the lines between memoir and novel to explore the nature of memory. The book centers on a writer trying to reconstruct a painful adolescent experience with a photographer, but she is confronted by significant gaps in her recollection. By labeling the highly autobiographical work a novel, Ullmann challenges the idea that memory is a perfect archive, instead presenting personal history as a fluid narrative shaped by what is remembered, what is lost, and what is imagined.</p>
