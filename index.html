          <h2>Reddit to Implement Age Verification for UK Users to Comply with Online Safety Act</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:14:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reddit is introducing age verification for its UK users to restrict access to mature content for those under 18. This measure is in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates robust age-checking techniques for sites with adult material. An external firm, Persona, will handle the verification using government IDs or selfies, with Reddit only retaining the user's verification status and date of birth. While regulators support the move for child protection, civil liberties groups express concerns about privacy and the erosion of online anonymity.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, former President Donald Trump stated he is "disappointed but not done with" Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine. This came as his administration announced new weapons for Ukraine and threatened severe tariffs on Russia if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days. Trump expressed frustration that his conversations with Putin have not led to peace, noting that diplomatic overtures are often followed by new attacks on Ukrainian cities. He also affirmed support for NATO, a shift from his previous criticisms of the organization.</p>

          <p>'Forever chemicals,' or PFAS, are persistent synthetic compounds that do not break down in the environment and are linked to serious health issues like cancer and organ damage. A recent court case in Italy highlighted the impact of industrial contamination, affecting an estimated 350,000 people. Originally developed for uses like the atomic bomb and Teflon pans, these chemicals are now found in countless consumer products and have been detected in the blood of nearly all Americans. Global regulatory efforts, including in the EU and US, are underway to limit their use and hold corporations accountable for pollution.</p>

          <p>The FTSE 100, the UK's leading stock index, has reached a new record high, breaking the 9,000-point barrier and marking a gain of over 10% in 2025. Analysts attribute this surge to several factors, including investors diversifying away from US markets and the UK's perceived trade advantages following a deal with the US. The index's composition of established, reliable companies in sectors like banking and defense has made it an attractive, stable option in an uncertain global economic climate.

          <p>Following a Department of Justice memo stating Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that no 'client list' for blackmail was found, Prince Andrew is reportedly able to travel abroad again without fear of legal action. However, royal experts maintain that he remains a significant embarrassment to the royal family due to his association with Epstein and his widely criticized 2019 interview. Despite his legal freedom, his public reputation is considered permanently tarnished, and a return to public duties or favor is seen as highly unlikely, with senior royals focused on protecting the institution.</p>

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that Russia 'didn't care' about the warning. Trump had announced that if a peace deal in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days, the U.S. would implement 100% secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia. The move represents a significant escalation of pressure on Moscow from the Trump administration, which has expressed growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to end the conflict.</p>

While there is no evidence Marten was abused, messages from years later show she was deeply affected by her experience, which she described as a cult.

          <p>A commission led by the government's antisemitism adviser has reported 'shocking experiences' of anti-Jewish discrimination in the UK, particularly since the October 7 attacks. The report makes several recommendations, including calling on the NHS to hold a summit to address what it found to be a 'specific unaddressed issue of antisemitism' within the health service. It also suggests standardized training to combat antisemitism, including in faith schools, and urges that Judaism be consistently understood as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure discrimination is handled appropriately.

          <p>Niclas Kvarnström, the European Union's managing director for Asia and the Pacific, is expected to leave his post following an upcoming EU-China summit, according to sources. A fluent Chinese speaker and former Swedish diplomat, Kvarnström has become an influential figure in shaping the EU's policy in the region during his two years in the role. His departure is described as 'quite sudden' by one insider, who suggested his absence would create a significant void within the EU's China policymaking apparatus at a time of complex geopolitical dynamics and strategic repositioning.</p>

          <p>A major abuse scandal at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland was uncovered after CCTV cameras, mistakenly left running for six months, captured 300,000 hours of footage. The recordings revealed what police described as 1,500 'crimes' in a single ward, including vulnerable patients being punched, kicked, and subjected to emotional abuse and neglect by staff. Despite the discovery nearly eight years ago, which triggered the UK's largest adult safeguarding investigation, no cases have yet come to trial. Families of the victims have not been allowed to see the footage and express frustration with the slow pace of justice.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent covering the trials of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon describes the proceedings as extraordinary and chaotic. The couple, now convicted of the gross negligence manslaughter of their baby, repeatedly disrupted the court, sacked numerous barristers, and were accused by the judge of attempting to sabotage their retrial. Despite the serious charges, they often acted like a couple in love, showing affection in the dock while displaying contempt for the legal process. The report details the many delays and unusual events that characterized the case, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the 'jaw-dropping' behavior of the defendants.</p>

No one has been rescued alive since the floods occurred on July 4, and crews are now beginning to drain reservoirs to search for submerged vehicles and victims.

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's dominant season, including seven wins and an Olympic gold medal, is being credited to his work with putting coach Phil Kenyon. A year ago, Scheffler was ranked outside the top 150 in putting despite being the best player from tee to green. Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip, but a switch to a mallet-style putter proved to be the key turning point. The English coach, who has worked with numerous major champions, has now guided players to a 'Golden Slam' of all four majors and an Olympic title.</p>

          <p>China is poised to set a new record for the number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in a single year, with 166 new funds introduced in the first half of 2025 alone. This pace puts the country on track to surpass its 2021 record of 277 ETFs. The surge is driven by strong investor demand for diversified returns and favorable regulations, including streamlined approvals and reduced fees from Chinese authorities. The trend reflects a broader global boom in ETFs, which offer investors a way to trade a basket of assets like stocks and bonds on an exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, a slowdown from the previous quarter but slightly beating economists' expectations. Despite this, other indicators point to underlying weakness, with retail sales growth slowing and the real estate slump deepening. The data has intensified calls for further government stimulus to support the recovery, as domestic consumption remains fragile and deflationary pressures are a concern. While the growth keeps China on track for its 5% annual target, policymakers face pressure to address structural issues and boost consumer confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The protections, which shield them from deportation and allow them to work, were set to expire as part of a broader effort to make more individuals eligible for removal. The administration had argued that conditions in Afghanistan had improved enough for their return.

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly 90% of new cars sold last year being electric. In cities like Oslo, EVs now constitute up to 40% of all passenger cars on the road, resulting in cleaner air and reduced noise. This success is attributed to years of consistent government policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs, higher taxes on gasoline and diesel cars, and heavy investment in public charging infrastructure. The country's approach, unhindered by a domestic automaker lobby, demonstrates a viable path to phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles.</p>
