          <p>A 550-pound British bomb from World War II was discovered near a bridge in Dresden, Germany, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents from the city center. Authorities established a 1,000-meter exclusion zone and began defusing operations once the area was cleared. Such discoveries are a regular occurrence in major German cities, a lasting legacy of Allied bombing campaigns during the war. This event highlights the ongoing efforts to manage unexploded ordnance and ensure public safety decades after the conflict ended.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney's fiscal third-quarter earnings exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to the continued growth of its streaming services and increased consumer spending at its theme parks. The direct-to-consumer segment saw a significant rise in revenue and subscribers for Disney+ and Hulu. However, these gains were partially offset by a decline in the traditional linear TV business, which faced lower advertising revenue and viewership. The company's experiences segment, including parks and cruises, reported robust growth, indicating strong consumer demand for in-person entertainment.</p>

          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a dire warning that thousands of people in El-Fasher, the capital of Sudan's North Darfur state, are on the brink of starvation. The city has been besieged by the rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for over a year, cutting off vital aid and causing food prices to skyrocket. Soup kitchens have been forced to close, and humanitarian access by land has been completely blocked, leaving an estimated 300,000 people in increasingly desperate conditions. The crisis is part of a broader conflict that the UN describes as the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, signaling a significant turnaround in its U.S. market. The fast-food giant's domestic same-store sales grew by 2.5%, reversing previous declines, a success attributed to popular promotions like a meal tie-in with the "Minecraft" movie. International markets also showed strong performance, with notable sales growth in the UK, Australia, and China. The positive results suggest the company's strategies to attract diners with value offerings and new menu items are effectively boosting its global performance.</p>

It describes incidents ranging from swastikas on desks to verbal harassment, creating an environment where students feel unsafe to express their Jewish identity. The author argues this is not just a physical safety issue but an emotional one, forcing teens to hide their heritage. The piece calls on school administrators to treat antisemitism with urgency, framing the issue as a threat to the core values of the American public school system.</p>

          <p>Sixty years after its passage, the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 is facing significant challenges that threaten its effectiveness in protecting minority voters. The article recounts the act's origins in the Civil Rights Movement, spurred by events like "Bloody Sunday" in Selma, and its initial success in dismantling discriminatory voting practices. However, recent Supreme Court decisions, particularly *Shelby County v. Holder* in 2013 which gutted pre-clearance requirements, have eroded its power. Advocacy groups now warn that democracy is at stake as legal battles continue over redistricting and voter access in states like Louisiana and Texas.</p>

          <p>Stanley Burkhardt, a 74-year-old former detective with a history of child sexual abuse convictions, has been jailed again in New Orleans. The new charges allege he illegally used social media in 2019 to post suggestive comments on photos of young men, violating the terms of his conditional release from a federal treatment facility for sexually dangerous individuals. Burkhardt, who has also been investigated as a potential serial killer, was working at a local market before his recent arrest.

          <p>Recently released FBI data for 2024 indicates a significant nationwide decrease in crime, challenging the narrative of an out-of-control crime wave often used in political rhetoric.

Incidents of reported sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault also declined. These figures, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, suggest that crime rates were at historic lows during the final full year of the previous administration, directly contradicting claims made during the election campaign.</p>

The essay posits that this approach cedes the future to China by focusing on nostalgia rather than fostering technological innovation and excellence.

          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democratic legislators to block a Republican redistricting plan is part of a long-standing political tactic in the state known as "breaking quorum." This article details the history of such actions, dating back to 1870. A notable recent example occurred in 2021, when Democrats fled to Washington, D.C., to stall a restrictive voting bill, though that measure eventually passed. Other walkouts in 2003 and 1979 also aimed to halt Republican-led initiatives. These events highlight the intense partisan battles in Texas politics and the extreme measures lawmakers sometimes take to prevent the passage of legislation they strongly oppose.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being economically questionable and politically unpopular, President Trump's tariffs on foreign imports could become a lasting feature of U.S. fiscal policy. The primary reason is the substantial revenue they generate, projected to be $2.2 trillion over the next decade, effectively acting as a major tax hike without congressional approval. With rising deficits and a political aversion to other forms of taxation, future presidents may be reluctant to repeal them and worsen the fiscal hole. This analysis suggests that the tariffs, reinforced by special interest lobbying, could transform America's approach to revenue generation, regardless of their economic impact.</p>

Replacing them with military faculty risks creating an insular, strategically obtuse military culture.

          <h2>Opinion: Trump Administration's Proposed Budget Cuts Pose a Dire Threat to American Science</h2>

          <p>This contributor piece argues that the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to science funding represent a grave threat to American progress and leadership. The author, an astrophysicist, notes that the plan calls for sharp reductions at NASA, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies, which will choke off basic, curiosity-driven research. While science provides clear economic and practical benefits, its true value lies in expanding human knowledge, a long-term process that requires sustained government investment. The article warns that ceding leadership in science will have unpredictable but profoundly negative consequences for the nation's future.</p>

          <h2>Court Orders University of California to Re-evaluate Policy Barring Undocumented Student Employment</h2>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California system must reconsider its policy that prohibits hiring students without legal documentation for on-campus jobs. The court found that the UC's justification for the policy—fear of potential federal litigation—was insufficient and that the practice is discriminatory under state law. While the ruling does not force the university to immediately overturn the policy, it requires a re-evaluation based on proper legal criteria. This decision is a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates who argue the policy denies students crucial financial and career-advancing opportunities.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, moments after he won the California Democratic primary. It details the chaotic scene as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Jordanian immigrant, opened fire in a kitchen pantry, fatally wounding Kennedy and injuring five others. The piece explores Sirhan's motives, rooted in his vehement opposition to Kennedy's support for Israel, and the subsequent trial that led to his life sentence. The event remains a pivotal and tragic moment in American history, cutting short a figure of hope during a decade of turmoil.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, some residents frustrated with the city's slow response to safety requests have begun painting their own crosswalks at dangerous intersections. One such DIY project near Stoner Park in Sawtelle was initially removed by the city, sparking a community outcry. In response, the city reversed course and announced it would officially install the crosswalks. This phenomenon highlights a broader tension between community-led safety initiatives and bureaucratic processes. Advocacy groups see these actions as a direct reaction to the city's failure to address its high rate of pedestrian-related traffic incidents.</p>

          <p>The 2023 murder of Israeli national Emil Lahaziel outside a Hollywood Hills mansion has pulled back the curtain on a secretive circuit of high-stakes poker games in Los Angeles. The investigation has revealed a world where Israeli organized crime figures and local gang members mingled with wealthy players, with games often involving large debts, extortion, and violence. The case has also led to charges against former NBA star Gilbert Arenas for allegedly hosting illegal games. Lahaziel's execution-style killing remains a mystery, but it highlights the dangerous intersection of underground gambling and criminal enterprises operating in the city.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to counter a potential Republican gerrymander in Texas by pushing for a partisan redrawing of California's own congressional maps. This "fight fire with fire" approach would require a ballot initiative to override California's current nonpartisan redistricting commission. The move presents a complex dilemma: whether to compromise a democratic norm in California to combat a perceived threat to national democracy. The proposal is fraught with political risk and personal ambition, forcing voters to weigh the principles of fair mapping against the high-stakes reality of partisan power struggles.</p>

          <p>In California's Imperial Valley, one of the state's hottest regions, unhoused and undocumented individuals face a perilous situation. They must contend with life-threatening summer heat while also navigating intensified sweeps by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Local outreach groups report that this heightened enforcement has driven these vulnerable populations into more secluded and dangerous locations like storm drains and canals, making it harder to provide essential aid like water. This dual pressure complicates survival, as accessing public cooling centers now carries the added risk of detention and deportation for many.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration is reviving thousands of deportation cases that were administratively closed years ago, creating uncertainty for immigrants who had built lives in the U.S. This policy shift targets cases that were previously shelved to prioritize more urgent matters, affecting individuals like DACA recipients and those married to U.S. citizens. Immigration attorneys report being inundated with motions to recalendar these old cases, often with little justification provided. This effort is seen by critics as a way to increase deportation numbers by overwhelming the already backlogged immigration court system.</p>
