          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm supplying major UK supermarkets like Tesco and Aldi, has been hit by a ransomware attack, encrypting their data and demanding payment for its release. The attack has disrupted order processing, potentially leading to food waste for customers, including Black Farmer founder Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, who fears thousands of meat products may be discarded if deliveries are not promptly restored. While smaller than recent cyberattacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, this incident highlights the growing cybersecurity challenges faced by smaller logistics companies in maintaining supply chains. Transport activities of the business have continued unaffected throughout this incident.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, had her appeal dismissed after being jailed for 31 months for inciting racial hatred in a post on X. The post, which called for "mass deportation now" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, was viewed 310,000 times before being deleted. The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence, stating that there was no arguable basis to consider the sentence manifestly excessive, reinforcing the legal consequences of inciting racial hatred online. Connolly will serve 40% of her sentence in prison before being released on license.</p>

          <p>Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, will be released from prison four months early after a High Court ruling reduced his sentence for contempt of court. He was jailed for ignoring an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee he libeled. The judge reduced the sentence due to Yaxley-Lennon's demonstrated "commitment" to comply with the injunction, including removing social media posts containing the libellous claims. His lawyers successfully argued that he had taken steps to comply with the order, leading to the reduction of the coercive element of his sentence.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study published in Nature suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, the foundation of complex life, lived around 2.72 billion years ago in oxygen-deficient conditions. Researchers from East China Normal University and Shenzhen University traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolising cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event. This finding supports the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes, challenging earlier findings about the lineage of this common ancestor. Understanding the origins of eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and its potential existence in outer space.</p>

          <p>Japan is reportedly considering softening its demand for a full removal of U.S. tariffs, potentially accepting lower duty rates to secure a trade agreement with the United States. This adjustment comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator prepares for a third round of ministerial-level talks with the U.S., acknowledging President Trump's reluctance to completely eliminate tariffs. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ishiba is facing pressure to sack the farm minister due to insensitive comments about rice prices, and Honda Motor Co. plans to reduce its EV investment due to lower-than-expected market growth.</p>

          <p>Retired four-star admiral Robert Burke was convicted on corruption charges for steering a $355,000 Navy contract to a company in exchange for a lucrative job. After retiring from the Navy in 2022, Burke began working at the company for $500,000 a year and had also attempted to secure a separate contract for the firm. The jury found him guilty of bribery, performing acts affecting a personal financial interest, and concealment of material facts.

          <p>A Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving through the House is facing scrutiny from Wall Street due to concerns that proposed tax breaks will outweigh spending cuts, potentially increasing the U.S. deficit.

The bill aims to renew President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire in 2025, and includes other tax breaks that could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the government's increasing debt and interest payment ratios. The credit rating firm noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. The downgrade reflects investor apprehension about the nation's fiscal management, with Moody's projecting federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% by 2035. Despite the downgrade, Moody's changed its outlook on the U.S. from negative to stable, citing the country's economic strengths and the dollar's role as a global reserve currency.</p>

However, these deals required painful concessions, highlighting Britain's diminished position in the post-Brexit era, according to this article. The deal with the U.S. still leaves Britain worse off than before Trump's presidency, while concessions were made to the E.U. regarding fishing rights in British waters. Despite these challenges, Britain's agreement with India offers some vindication of the Brexit case, as it allows for deals that were not possible as part of the E.U.</p>

          <p>While President Donald Trump's poll numbers have declined, Democrats are not necessarily benefiting, as many voters disillusioned with Trump are also dissatisfied with the Democratic Party. Congressional Democrats face unfavorable views, and new Trump voters, including youth and people of color, are not returning to the Democratic fold. The article suggests that Democrats need to present a more credible alternative and address the growing distrust of government to capitalize on Trump's unpopularity.</p>

          <p>World Sevens Football (W7F), a new seven-a-side format, aims to capitalize on the growing popularity of women's football by offering faster, more dynamic matches and significant financial rewards for players. With an investment of US $100 million over five years, W7F seeks to attract younger fans through shorter games and a player-centric approach. However, the inaugural event has faced criticism for clashing with the Swedish league schedule and adding to player workloads. Despite these challenges, W7F emphasizes player care, financial equity, and collaboration with players to promote women's football.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia has maintained his demand that Ukraine capitulate on his terms before any peace talks can commence, even as President Trump has agreed to direct talks between the two nations, according to this article. However, this hard-line position could undermine Putin's broader economic goals to normalize relations with the United States. Trump has indicated that economic rapprochement with Russia will only occur after peace in Ukraine, potentially confining Russia to economic isolation. Despite this, Putin appears confident, bolstered by stable oil prices and a resilient Russian economy.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff reduction, a survey reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters plan to increase exports to markets outside the U.S., due to lasting scars from the trade war. The U.S.-China "decoupling" remains a likely scenario as Chinese exporters seek to diversify and American firms shift production out of China. Many firms anticipate a decrease in export turnover this year due to the U.S. tariffs, which remain high even after the recent deal. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is a top choice for businesses seeking to move production overseas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's cuts to U.S. foreign aid are jeopardizing road and energy projects in Africa, including a new overpass in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, which was previously advertised as "Financed by the American people." This article states that the U.S. is shifting its focus to trade rather than aid, leading to uncertainty for large infrastructure projects funded by the United States. While the Trump administration prioritizes commercial diplomacy, experts argue that agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which funds these projects, also boost U.S. interests and should not be dismantled.</p>

Loomer has criticized the new pope, mounted a campaign against Trumpâ€™s pick for surgeon general, blasted his attorney general, and objected to Trumpâ€™s diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. Despite not holding an official position, Loomer's influence on social media and her access to Trump have raised concerns about her impact on the administration's direction.</p>

          <p>Representative Yassamin Ansari is introducing the Artemis Act, named for Iranian Christian convert Artemis Ghasemzadeh, to prevent the expedited removal of individuals fleeing countries that persecute religious minorities. The bill seeks to ensure that these individuals have the opportunity to claim asylum in a U.S. immigration court. The legislation is inspired by Ghasemzadeh's deportation to Panama before she could seek asylum, highlighting the need to uphold laws that protect vulnerable migrants. Immigration lawyers say the law requires immigration officials to give migrants a "fear interview" â€” a process in which they present their cases and provide evidence about why they fear being deported to their home countries.</p>

          <p>Emergency departments in the United States are facing a crisis due to a dramatic rise in patients boarding in the ER while waiting for inpatient beds, leading to overcrowded conditions and compromised care. A recent study shows that nearly three-quarters of emergency medicine residents report negative effects on their training due to boarding, including anxiety and diminished ability to manage patients. The problem stems from systemic issues such as financial pressures, an aging population, and limited access to aftercare services. The solution requires collective action to address the root causes of ER crowding and invest in better healthcare systems and medical education.</p>
