          <p>China is set to host its largest military parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II victory, with expectations of showcasing advanced unmanned systems and AI-enabled, multi-domain operations. Analysts anticipate the display of a wide array of drone systems and "robobeasts," underscoring the People's Liberation Army's rapid progress in integrating autonomous technologies across air, land, and sea domains. Officials have pledged to reveal "new-domain forces and new-quality combat capabilities," highlighting China's robust ability to protect national sovereignty, security, and development interests. For security reasons, experts believe these cutting-edge systems will likely be presented in static displays rather than in dynamic demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government has initiated a pilot program offering £1 single bus tickets and £3 day passes for individuals aged 16-21 across Wales, with an expansion to younger children planned for November. This scheme, supported by £15 million over two financial years, seeks to make public transport more accessible and affordable, thereby encouraging young people to utilize buses for education, training, employment, and leisure activities. Transport for Wales has already received over 10,000 applications for the mytravelpass, indicating strong interest. While the initiative aims to foster sustainable travel behaviors, an independent watchdog noted that young people's satisfaction with value for money in Wales' public transport is currently lower than in England and Scotland.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 01:00:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that the debate around immigration in the UK and US is characterized by constantly shifting demands, where no policy, even Brexit, is ever enough to appease opponents of immigration. It highlights escalating crackdowns in the US, where militarized borders and increased ICE powers create widespread fear among immigrants, both documented and undocumented. The piece suggests that political rhetoric often fuels a sense of crisis, leading to ever-harsher measures that extend precarity to citizens in blended families and redefine national identity. This cycle indicates that the core question is not "how many is too many," but "how few is few enough," with an unattainable answer.</p>

          <p>Luxury jewellery retailer Vashi Dominguez is at the center of the UK's largest diamond scam, with his business collapsing in 2023 and leaving £170 million in debts. BBC Panorama exposed that staff were instructed to pose as customers to create a false impression of a thriving business for investors, and internal documents reveal sales figures were severely misrepresented. The company's purported £157 million diamond stock was later assessed at a mere £100,000, resulting in substantial losses for investors. Despite the immense financial deception, neither the Metropolitan Police nor the Serious Fraud Office has initiated an investigation, raising questions among the defrauded investors.</p>

Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading as investors evaluated China's August manufacturing data, and US financial markets are observing the Labor Day public holiday. The day's data front in Europe remains relatively quiet, with Turkish growth and EU unemployment figures expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading on Monday as investors carefully assessed China's RatingDog manufacturing data for August, which indicated an unexpected expansion at 50.5, a rebound from the previous month's contraction. Market sentiment was also shaped by evolving India-China relations, following an agreement between leaders to function as development partners rather than rivals during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Chinese President Xi Jinping used his opening remarks at the summit to advocate for strengthening artificial intelligence cooperation among SCO members, while explicitly rejecting a "Cold War mentality." Hong Kong's Hang Seng index notably rose, boosted by Alibaba Group's significant jump, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi index saw declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD experienced a nearly 8% decline after the company reported a sharp 30% drop in its second-quarter net profit compared to the previous year. This significant reduction in profitability is primarily attributed to an aggressive and ongoing price war within China's highly competitive domestic EV industry, which has negatively impacted the sector's overall development. Despite this, BYD's revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, partly due to an expansion in its overseas sales, highlighting its global ambitions. Chinese authorities have previously cautioned carmakers against intensifying price cuts, as BYD and other domestic brands continue to navigate intense local market pressures while seeking new international markets.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the private RatingDog PMI reaching 50.5, surpassing estimates and marking the fastest expansion in five months. This improvement was partly driven by a recovery in new export orders, indicating resilience despite tariffs, though domestic demand showed less improvement. While overall business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak for the fifth consecutive month, reflecting continued caution among business owners. Experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a pickup in domestic demand, as profit recovery remains slow. (not investment advice)</p>

Prescott, who recently secured his own long-term extension, welcomed the resolution, viewing it as a way to avert a prolonged distraction for the team.

She subsequently reported the incident to station staff, leading to the man's arrest. Buckingham Palace has not disputed the details of this account.

          <p>Novak Djokovic successfully overcame a mid-match neck injury scare during his US Open fourth-round match against qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff, ultimately securing a dominant 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory. This impressive win propelled the 38-year-old tennis star to achieve a historic milestone, becoming the oldest man to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slams in a single season, further extending his all-time record to 64 major quarter-final appearances. Despite briefly grappling with discomfort in his neck, Djokovic maintained his composure and effectively dominated the match, breaking Struff's serve six times. He is now set to face the No. 4 seed, Taylor Fritz, the last American man remaining in the bracket, as he continues his pursuit of a record 25th major title.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to deport unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children who lacked a formal deportation order, just as planes were prepared to depart from Texas. US District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued a broader temporary restraining order, effective for 14 days, citing the government's hurried execution of the plan during a holiday weekend. The Justice Department asserted these were repatriations intended for family reunification, but lawyers for the children countered that this action violated federal laws designed to protect minors from swift deportations, noting some parents had not requested returns. The ruling ensures these children will be returned to the custody of Health and Human Services.</p>

Although overall revenue fell short of estimates, the company's net income remarkably increased by 78%, partly attributed to gains from equity investments and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. The cloud division notably saw a 26% revenue increase, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth, firmly positioning Alibaba as a major player in the artificial intelligence sector. The company is also making substantial investments in "quick commerce" despite intense market competition, aiming for considerable future gross merchandise value. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a recent reduction in small boat crossings across the Channel, the government remains committed to ending the costly use of hotels for migrants, a policy that has generated significant public debate and local protests.

Maritime analysts suggest these actions aim to offset China's earlier strategic gains in the archipelago.
