          <p>In Wilmington, Los Angeles, 31 construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a tunnel collapse. The incident occurred at the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, part of the Clearwater Project, a major wastewater management initiative. All workers were brought to safety approximately an hour after the collapse and were found to have no visible injuries, having climbed over a large pile of dirt to escape. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed extensive resources, including all its Urban Search and Rescue teams, to manage the emergency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-saving measure. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) comes as the volume of letters sent annually declines, increasing delivery costs and stamp prices. Under the new rules, first-class letters will continue to be delivered six days a week, but second-class mail will be limited to every other weekday. Ofcom stated the change is necessary for the postal service's survival but emphasized that Royal Mail must implement it effectively.</p>

          <p>Former US Secretary of State John Kerry stated that his fellow Democrats allowed the US-Mexico border to be "under siege" during the Biden presidency. In an interview with the BBC, Kerry remarked that he told President Biden the party had mishandled the immigration issue for years, giving a political advantage to Republicans like Donald Trump. Kerry asserted that protecting the border is a fundamental duty of any nation and that Trump was correct in his assessment of the problem, even as he criticized the current administration's aggressive deportation tactics.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing its institutional credibility and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. In a recent article, Sheng Songcheng noted China's low inflation, current account surplus, and large foreign reserves as significant advantages. He contended that the yuan has already demonstrated stability and reduced sensitivity to global risk indicators, such as the war in Ukraine and US tariffs. The discussion highlights an ongoing debate about the internationalization of the yuan amid wavering confidence in the US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights Vienna's housing system as a successful model, often described as a "renters' utopia," in contrast to housing crises elsewhere. The city's stability is attributed to its large social housing stock, which comprises 43% of its housing units and serves a wide range of income levels, not just the poor. This system, originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, helps keep rents low in both the social and private sectors. While acknowledging challenges like complex allocation systems, the article suggests that Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers valuable lessons for other cities.</p>

Weighing just 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that effectively command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat. In tests, the cyborg bee followed the given commands with a 90% success rate, marking a significant step in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

The president stated that copper is a critical material for defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies. The announcement caused a significant surge in copper prices, with U.S. consumers potentially facing much higher costs than the rest of the world. While the administration aims to reshore copper production, experts caution that it will take years to build domestic capacity to offset the country's reliance on imports, primarily from Chile.

          <h2>Trump Administration Sues California Over Regulations Allegedly Driving Up Egg Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed a federal lawsuit against California, alleging that the state's regulations on chicken and egg farms are contributing to soaring egg prices nationwide. The suit claims that California's anti-animal cruelty laws, which mandate more space for hens, constitute "unnecessary red tape" that illegally impacts egg producers in other states. The administration argues that federal law requires national uniformity in egg safety standards. This legal action is part of President Trump's broader vow to lower egg prices, a key consumer concern amid wider inflation.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo ship in the Red Sea within a week, resulting in at least three deaths and multiple missing crew members. The Greek-operated vessel, Eternity C, was hit by rocket-propelled grenades, lost all propulsion, and eventually sank. This follows a similar attack on the vessel Magic Seas days earlier. The Houthis claim they are targeting ships linked to Israel, the US, or the UK in support of Palestinians. The attacks represent a significant escalation in the threat to international shipping and have been condemned by the US and the EU.</p>

The move comes as WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles, while Ferrero has been actively expanding its portfolio by acquiring other major food businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is set to propose stricter welfare curbs, including barring foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits. In an upcoming speech, she will describe Britain's rising benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" that threatens the economy. This move aims to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour government, which recently scaled back its own planned cuts to the welfare system after a backbench rebellion. The Conservative proposals also include limiting eligibility for mental health conditions and creating a dividing line with Reform UK.</p>

The letter also criticized Brazil for alleged attacks on free speech rights and unfair trade practices.

Oxfam argues that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems allow the super-rich to accumulate vast fortunes while inequality deepens.

In contrast, a few days earlier, the ferocity of flooding in Texas caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 119 deaths.

The lack of clear implementation details for these threatened tariffs has left many Chinese exporters in a state of limbo.

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer goods and industrial products, according to economists and industry experts. Because copper is a vital component in electrical wiring, plumbing, electronics, and vehicles, the tariff is expected to have ripple effects across the economy. The policy could increase costs for everything from home repairs and appliances to electric vehicles and semiconductors. While the administration argues the tariff will revive the domestic copper industry, experts note it would take years for US production to meet demand. (not investment advice)</p>
