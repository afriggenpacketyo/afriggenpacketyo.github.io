          <p>European stock markets are poised for a negative start on Thursday, continuing a week of fluctuating trade performance across the region. Major indices in the U.K., Germany, and France are all projected to open lower, following a mixed session on Wednesday where luxury brand gains helped lift some markets. Investors are closely watching economic data, including the U.K.'s latest GDP figures, and corporate earnings from major banks and industrial firms. This market choppiness reflects broader uncertainty, with ongoing U.S. government shutdown concerns and trade tensions influencing global investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to halt the country's purchases of Russian oil, a move aimed at increasing economic pressure on Moscow amid the war in Ukraine. Trump described the commitment as a "big stop" that would be implemented within a short timeframe. However, an Indian government spokesperson stated that discussions are still "ongoing" and that India's import policies are primarily guided by the objective of safeguarding consumer interests. The U.S. has been leveraging tariffs to pressure India, which has so far maintained a neutral stance in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Former Newcastle United midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has asserted that his recent move to the Arabian Falcons in the UAE's third-tier football league was not financially motivated. Shelvey stated that the typical salary in the league is minimal compared to his previous earnings and that his decision was driven by a desire for a "fresh start" for his family. He cited concerns about safety and the social climate in the UK as reasons for the relocation, expressing a preference for raising his children in Dubai. The 33-year-old is now combining playing with coaching as he pursues his UEFA A Licence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing concerns over drug trafficking and the release of prisoners into the United States. The acknowledgment follows a series of deadly U.S. military strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and has drawn sharp criticism from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who condemned the action as a "coup." This move has also raised significant alarm among members of the U.S. Congress, who are concerned about a potential escalation into unauthorized conflict without proper oversight and transparency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has started a process that could bar Hong Kong's HKT Trust and its subsidiaries from accessing American telecommunications networks due to national security risks. The agency cited HKT's ties to China, particularly through its parent company PCCW, which is partially owned by state-linked China Unicom. This action is part of a broader FCC effort to remove Chinese entities perceived as threats from U.S. communications infrastructure. The move has impacted HKT's stock and highlights the increasing challenges faced by businesses linked to Hong Kong tycoon Richard Li amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>

Despite his strong showing, the Lakers lost 121-94, largely due to being outscored 37-8 in the fourth quarter. The game also saw starting forward Jarred Vanderbilt leave with a left quad contusion, adding an injury concern for the team ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing scrutiny after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped charges against two men accused of spying for China, just before their trial was set to begin. The Director of Public Prosecutions stated the case collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially labeling China a "national security threat" at the time of the alleged offenses, a new legal precedent. This has sparked a political dispute, with the Conservative opposition accusing the Labour government of a cover-up to protect relations with Beijing. In response, the government has published the witness statements to demonstrate transparency.</p>

          <p>As the Mercury Prize ceremony approaches, bookmakers have identified Irish singer CMAT and iconic band Pulp as the leading favorites to win the prestigious award for album of the year. CMAT is favored for her third album, "Euro-Country," while Pulp's acclaimed comeback record, "More," is also a strong contender. This year, the awards ceremony has moved from London to Newcastle for the first time, part of a broader industry effort to decentralize major cultural events and recognize talent from across the UK and Ireland. The shortlist also includes past winners Wolf Alice and 84-year-old folk legend Martin Carthy.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing 150 victims of the Jesus Army cult has called plans to distribute the group's multimillion-pound fortune to former members, including some accused of abuse, "shameful" and "appalling." An investigation revealed that 172 loyal members of the disgraced sect are set to receive significantly larger payouts than the compensation awarded to over 600 abuse victims. Survivors have described the prospect of their alleged abusers benefiting from the estimated £50 million in assets as "sickening." The trust managing the group's dissolution stated it cannot disclose beneficiaries' identities to protect victim privacy and has no power to redirect the assets.</p>

          <p>A scientist recently laid off from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that the Trump administration's workforce reductions during the government shutdown will lead to "more preventable deaths." The scientist, who remains anonymous for fear of retribution, described the situation as chaotic and stated that entire public health programs have been eliminated. The firings are part of a broader plan to cut over 10,000 federal jobs, which has already seen about 600 CDC employees terminated. This turmoil raises concerns about the nation's ability to respond to disease outbreaks and other public health threats.</p>

The exchanges, which included messages such as "I love Hitler" and one calling sexual assault "epic," involved adult members of the organization, some in their 30s. Despite bipartisan calls for the participants' resignations, Vance argued that focusing on "stupid, offensive jokes" from young people is a distraction from more serious issues, a stance that has drawn considerable criticism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is advancing plans to construct a large triumphal arch, dubbed the "Arc de Trump," at the entrance to Washington D.C. from Virginia. The monument, intended to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary, would be privately funded and is the latest in a series of architectural and decorative projects Trump has initiated during his second term. These projects include a gilded White House makeover and a new $250 million ballroom. While presidents often update the White House, Trump's vision for a major new monument reflects a more ambitious effort to reshape the capital's landscape in his distinctive style.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom's office has criticized the White House for a lack of coordination and communication, calling the plan a "pompous display of power."

This figure represents the highest level since the pandemic in 2022, reflecting a brutal job market and broader economic uncertainty influenced by the government shutdown and ongoing trade tariffs. Many job seekers report exhaustive interview processes that end in rejection, forcing them to deplete savings and retirement funds.

          <p>A UK housing association chief has proposed a plan to address the costly and controversial use of hotels for asylum seekers by moving them into social housing. The proposal suggests the government could fund councils and housing associations to purchase properties, which would create new social housing for local residents while freeing up existing stock for asylum seekers. This could drastically cut the annual cost per person from about £54,000 in hotels to just £4,000. The idea, which has been discussed with government departments, aims to provide a more sustainable and cost-effective solution while also increasing the nation's overall social housing supply.</p>
