          <p>The world's leading authority on food crises has issued a dire alert, stating that the "worst-case scenario of famine" is currently unfolding in the Gaza Strip. Mounting evidence, including widespread starvation and malnutrition-related deaths, indicates that famine thresholds have already been reached in parts of the territory. Despite some recent humanitarian measures announced by Israel, international organizations report little change on the ground, hampered by blockades and logistical chaos. Experts are calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities to allow for a large-scale humanitarian response and prevent catastrophic loss of life.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Midtown Manhattan office building, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life. New York City's mayor stated the shooter, identified as Shane Tamura from Las Vegas, was apparently targeting the NFL offices located in the building. A note found on the gunman indicated he believed he suffered from CTE, a brain injury associated with contact sports, and blamed the league for his condition. The investigation revealed he took the wrong elevator, leading him to a different company's offices where he continued the attack.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep, and Peugeot, has warned that U.S. trade tariffs will negatively impact its 2025 earnings by approximately 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion). The automaker anticipates the majority of this financial hit will occur in the second half of the year. The company's North American operations are particularly affected, as vehicles produced in Canada and Mexico are now subject to new U.S. levies. Stellantis noted it is actively engaged with policymakers while also conducting long-term scenario planning to mitigate the financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A psychologist with over two decades of experience highlights several common "lies" that well-intentioned parents tell their children, which can inadvertently hinder their long-term success and well-being. Phrases like "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" can create self-blame, while admonitions against being selfish can prevent the development of healthy self-care. The article suggests that parents should instead foster realism, emotional honesty, and an understanding that asking for help is a sign of strength. It advocates for more nuanced conversations about difficult feelings and social situations to build emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>Boeing has significantly reduced its quarterly losses and reported a 35% increase in revenue, driven by the highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," highlighting improved performance and stability, although the company still posted an adjusted loss. The positive results were tempered by a $445 million charge related to a Justice Department settlement over the 737 Max crashes and a delay in the certification of new Max models. The company is increasing production and aims to be cash-generative by the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

The start of full-scale removal of an estimated 800 tons of melted fuel debris from one of the reactors will be postponed until at least 2037. This setback casts further doubt on the Japanese government's overall goal of decommissioning the entire plant by 2051, a target some experts believe could take over a century to achieve. The delay is necessary to reduce radiation levels and construct specialized facilities required for the complex and hazardous retrieval operation.</p>

While many analysts do not expect a rate cut until at least September, they advise prospective homebuyers against trying to time the market, as a future drop in rates could fuel increased competition and higher home prices.

          <p>A line of severe thunderstorms, fueled by a massive heat dome over the southern U.S., is causing widespread damage across the Midwest. The storms have produced wind gusts over 90 mph, downed trees and power lines, and left hundreds of thousands without electricity in several states. Meanwhile, the heat dome continues to pose a danger to over 165 million people from the Great Plains to the Northeast, with heat indices expected to reach as high as 116 degrees. The weather pattern is creating a dual threat of destructive storms in the north and dangerous, oppressive heat in the south and east.</p>

Greene argued that calling for the starvation of innocent people is wrong and that such statements from a Jewish representative could fuel antisemitism. Her comments place her alongside a small group of progressive lawmakers in Congress who have used the term "genocide" to describe the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
