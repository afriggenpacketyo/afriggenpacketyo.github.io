          <p>Public and political pressure is mounting on the US Justice Department to release all unclassified files related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. This renewed focus highlights President Trump's past friendship with Epstein in the 1990s, a relationship Trump has since tried to distance himself from. Despite bipartisan support for a transparency act, the investigation is currently stalled by the ongoing government shutdown, while a posthumous memoir from survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre adds new allegations regarding Epstein's activities.</p>

          <p>A multi-force police operation is searching for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was erroneously released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu was serving a 12-month sentence for sexually assaulting a teenage girl and a woman. The incident has sparked political outcry, with officials calling the release "totally unacceptable" and critics pointing to it as a symptom of a broken prison system. An internal investigation is underway, and a prison officer has been removed from duty.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" following the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to the Caribbean. The move significantly increases U.S. military presence in the region, ostensibly as part of a counter-narcotics operation that has already included ten air strikes on vessels. With the U.S. not recognizing Maduro's presidency and President Trump considering targeting drug facilities within Venezuela, there are growing fears the build-up is aimed at regime change.</p>

          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina recounts his decision to invest in AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was convinced by Staniszewski's deep technical understanding and vision for creating non-robotic AI voices. Reina's strategy focuses on backing highly technical founders in pre-seed companies before their industries become popular. ElevenLabs has since achieved a multi-billion dollar valuation and is planning a global expansion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has begun a five-day tour of Asia, with key stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, focusing on critical trade negotiations and diplomacy. The trip's centerpiece will be a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to address the ongoing trade war. While en route, Trump also expressed openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019, though U.S. officials have stated no such meeting is currently planned.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being viewed by experts as a significant, symbolic step toward repairing strained diplomatic ties. While major immediate breakthroughs are not anticipated, the visit marks a deliberate effort to restart dialogue and cooperation. This is Xi's first visit since 2014, a time that represented a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations and resulted in a free-trade agreement. The current talks are expected to address key bilateral issues and regional security, including the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the U.S. has nearly doubled since 2000, reaching 68 million and now constituting one in five Americans. This growth has been driven by a combination of immigration and U.S. births. The report highlights that Latinos are the youngest major ethnic group with a median age of 31, and a large majority (79%) are U.S. citizens. People of Mexican origin remain the largest subgroup, while California and Texas host the largest state populations.</p>

          <p>During a protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the San Francisco Bay Area, officers fired upon a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward a police line outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. The driver was wounded and taken into custody for a mental health evaluation following the incident. The protest was a response to a Trump administration plan to use the base as a staging area for Border Patrol agents, an operation that was reportedly canceled just before the demonstration escalated.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Queen Mother Sirikit, the widow of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, has died at the age of 93 in a Bangkok hospital. She had been suffering from a blood infection and had been largely out of the public eye for several years due to poor health. Her marriage to King Bhumibol spanned nearly seven decades, during which she became a revered national figure. Known as the "Mother of the Thai Nation," her birthday, August 12, is celebrated annually as Thailand's National Mother's Day.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have petitioned a U.S. appeals court to block a Trump administration order that would force them to dissolve their joint venture. The U.S. Department of Transportation mandated the termination of the nearly nine-year-old partnership by January 1, citing anticompetitive effects. The airlines argue that ending the venture, which allows them to coordinate flights and pricing between the U.S. and Mexico, would cause severe operational disruptions, lead to route cancellations, and eliminate up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits.
