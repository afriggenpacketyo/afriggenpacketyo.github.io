          <p>At least two firefighters were killed and another individual was injured after being targeted by sniper fire while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain in Idaho. The Kootenai County Sheriff confirmed that first responders were under active attack from a suspect using high-powered rifles, prompting a large-scale law enforcement operation. The situation remains dynamic, with authorities working to neutralize the shooter and rescue civilians still on the mountain. The FBI has been deployed to provide tactical support in what officials have described as a heinous assault on public safety personnel.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is currently debating a massive legislative package central to President Trump's second-term agenda, which includes spending increases for border security and defense offset by cuts to social programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. After advancing with narrow Republican support, the bill now faces extended debate and a potential "vote-a-rama" of amendments. The process highlights deep partisan divides as Republicans utilize budget reconciliation to bypass the need for Democratic votes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity has contracted for the third straight month, with the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) remaining below the 50-point benchmark that indicates expansion. Despite some stimulus efforts stabilizing industrial production and new orders, factories continue to see declines in inventory and employment levels. The sector is struggling with a domestic price war, sluggish consumer demand, and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on exports. These persistent deflationary pressures are challenging Beijing's economic goals, even as leaders pledge to boost domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent arrest of two elementary school teachers in Japan for taking and sharing indecent photos of female students has ignited widespread concern over child safety in schools. The men allegedly used a private social media group with other educators to circulate voyeuristic images, including some reportedly taken with a school camera. The case has prompted public outrage and calls for stronger protective measures, highlighting systemic issues despite existing safeguards. This incident follows other cases of misconduct by educators, increasing pressure for the implementation of a more robust background check system for school employees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Scientific studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a primary cause. This system, which recovers energy while slowing the vehicle, produces a low-frequency deceleration that can induce queasiness and discomfort. Researchers in China and Hong Kong are exploring the issue to find solutions that can improve passenger comfort as the automotive industry continues its rapid transition to electric power.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came hours after he faced threats of a primary challenge from President Trump. The conflict arose from Tillis's opposition to the president's major spending and tax bill, which he argued contained devastating Medicaid cuts for his state. In his retirement announcement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating that independent thinkers are becoming an "endangered species." His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a historically Republican state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit a temporary migrant detention center in South Florida, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz" due to its remote location in the Everglades. The visit, reportedly at the request of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, aligns with the administration's intensified efforts to detain and deport migrants. The facility's location in a vast wetland populated by alligators is seen by some officials as a natural deterrent requiring minimal security. This event underscores the administration's focus on immigration enforcement, which has seen the number of individuals in federal detention rise significantly.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities but did not completely destroy them. His assessment contrasts with more definitive claims of obliteration from U.S. officials, suggesting Iran retains industrial and technological capacities to restart its program. Grossi emphasized the critical need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to the sites to verify the status and location of nuclear materials. He warned that military action alone cannot definitively solve the issue, as the knowledge and industrial capacity remain.</p>

Her case has become a prominent #MeToo story in Japan, highlighting the challenges victims face when confronting powerful figures.

          <p>Iran's deputy foreign minister has stated that the United States must guarantee there will be no further military attacks before Tehran will agree to resume diplomatic negotiations. Following recent U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran says it has received messages through mediators that the Trump administration wants to return to the table. However, Iran is insisting on a clear U.S. position regarding the non-use of force during any potential dialogue. The official also reiterated Iran's intent to continue enriching uranium for what it claims are peaceful purposes, rejecting accusations of developing a nuclear weapon.</p>
