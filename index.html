          <p>This opinion article examines the political dynamics surrounding President Trump's major legislative bill, focusing on whether the fiscally conservative House Freedom Caucus will block its passage. The author argues that killing the bill would trigger a massive tax hike and harm military readiness, ultimately hurting the Republican party. A potential compromise is proposed: allowing the caucus to lead a second reconciliation bill focused on deeper spending cuts and entitlement reform, thereby giving them a substantive role beyond political grandstanding. This is presented as a crucial moment for the party to deliver on its core campaign promises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson is emerging as a rare talent capable of competing in cycling's Grand Tours, despite his large physical frame which is typically a disadvantage in mountain stages. At 6ft 4in, his unique combination of height and low body weight allows him to climb with elite competitors. After a breakout performance in the 2023 Tour de France, Jorgenson joined the top-tier Vismaâ€“Lease a Bike team, securing major victories.

          <p>Huang Yiping, an adviser to China's central bank, has proposed that Hong Kong could serve as a more feasible location than mainland China for issuing a stablecoin pegged to the offshore yuan. He argued that mainland China's strict capital controls would make a domestic rollout very difficult. This suggestion comes amid concerns in Beijing that the United States could leverage dollar-backed stablecoins to reinforce the US dollar's global dominance. Huang noted that while Hong Kong is progressing in this area, a stablecoin pegged to the Hong Kong dollar would ultimately be linked to the US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following severe disruptions in April and May due to runway construction and air traffic control issues, Newark Liberty International Airport is showing signs of recovery. United Airlines reports that Newark was the most reliable New York City area airport in June, a claim supported by aviation analytics data showing fewer cancellations than its counterparts. However, traveler experiences remain mixed, with some still encountering significant delays while others notice the improvement. The recovery comes as the nation's air travel system faces a major test with record passenger numbers expected for the July Fourth holiday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals without diabetes, experiencing sharp drops in blood sugar after meals, known as being a 'dipper,' can lead to fatigue, mood swings, and overeating. Research indicates these post-meal crashes can cause people to consume hundreds of extra calories throughout the day. To manage these fluctuations, experts recommend three key strategies for a more stable blood sugar level. These include 'clothing your carbs' by pairing them with protein and fiber, spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day, and eating proteins and fats before carbohydrates in a meal.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have reached a trade agreement that imposes a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports to the US, a significant reduction from a previously threatened rate of 46%. In return, Vietnam has agreed to provide preferential market access for certain US goods, including large-engine cars. The deal also addresses concerns about transshipment, where goods from third countries like China are rerouted through Vietnam to evade tariffs. Under the agreement, such shipments will now face a higher 40% levy, a move that prompted a warning from Beijing against trade deals that harm third parties.</p>

The industrial action forced the cancellation of a quarter of flights at Paris's main airports and half of the flights at Nice. Airlines such as Ryanair have been heavily impacted, canceling over 170 flights and disrupting travel for passengers flying not only to and from France but also through its airspace to other destinations like the UK, Spain, and Greece.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon that intensifies heatwaves for city dwellers. This effect is caused by dark surfaces like asphalt and concrete absorbing and retaining heat, a lack of cooling vegetation, and tall buildings trapping warm air. The temperature difference can be as much as 10 to 15 degrees Celsius. Potential solutions to mitigate this effect include greening cities with more trees and parks, and implementing 'cool' infrastructure like reflective white roofs and permeable pavements that absorb less heat.</p>

          <p>Researchers have shed new light on the ancient origins of Uralic-speaking peoples, a group that includes modern Finns, Estonians, and Hungarians. By analyzing the genomes of 180 ancient individuals and comparing them with existing data, the study traced a complex migration pattern originating from Siberia thousands of years ago. The findings show how these populations spread across Eurasia, reaching as far as the Baltic Sea and East Asia, bringing their distinct languages and technologies with them. This genetic evidence helps solve a long-standing linguistic and archaeological mystery about the Uralic ancestral homeland.</p>

          <p>Leading Chinese brokerages, including GF Securities and Industrial Securities, are forecasting that China's stock market will likely remain flat in the second half of the year. Analysts believe that a lack of fresh catalysts, combined with a deflationary trend and weak earnings growth, will deter investors from making significant bets. While government intervention and a modest economic recovery are expected to provide a floor for the market, they are unlikely to trigger a major rally. This cautious outlook for mainland stocks contrasts with more optimistic views on Hong Kong's market. (not investment advice)</p>

However, investors appeared to focus more on positive trade news, specifically a deal with Vietnam that set tariffs at 20% instead of a feared 46%.

          <p>An investigation by the BBC has uncovered that numerous small businesses across the UK are facing financial ruin due to costly and lengthy contracts for renting phone equipment. Experts claim that some telecoms companies use unethical sales practices to lock businesses into five or seven-year finance deals with grossly inflated prices. One business owner reported paying over Â£54,000 to rent just five phones, a cost that is crippling his company. These business-to-business contracts often lack the consumer protection of a cooling-off period, leaving owners trapped in agreements they claim were mis-sold.</p>

          <p>A woman has shared the distressing experience of her father's severe traffic accident being filmed by onlookers and shared online, prompting a campaign against such behavior. When she was 17, her father was critically injured, and she witnessed fellow bus passengers filming the scene instead of helping. The online speculation led to false rumors of his death, compounding the family's trauma. Backed by emergency services, the 'It's Not Your Story To Tell' campaign urges the public to show dignity and use their phones to call for help rather than to capture and share traumatic events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is kicking off a year of festivities to mark the 250th anniversary of American independence with an event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. The celebration is part of the America250 initiative, which organizers hope will help unite a politically polarized nation through patriotism and a renewed sense of civic pride. The choice of Iowa, a state that has strongly supported Trump, is seen as symbolic of bringing the country together from its center. The yearlong series of events will culminate in a major celebration on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., next year.</p>
