          <p>Lyft's shares experienced a significant increase of 20% on Friday following the company's announcement of an expanded share buyback plan and better-than-expected gross bookings. CEO David Risher expressed confidence in the company's performance, stating that Lyft is not observing any signs of consumer slowdown despite broader economic uncertainties. The company's gross bookings increased by 13% year-over-year, reaching $4.16 billion, and the number of rides increased by 16% to 218.4 million. Lyft's board of directors has approved an increase in the company's share repurchase program from $500 million to $750 million, with plans to utilize $500 million over the next year.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a former Supreme Court Justice nominated by George H.W. Bush, passed away peacefully at his home in Concord, New Hampshire, at the age of 85; the Supreme Court announced his death on Friday morning. Souter, known for his preference for solitude and intellectual pursuits over Washington's social scene, retired at 69, creating a Supreme Court vacancy early in Barack Obama's presidency, which Obama filled by nominating Sonia Sotomayor. Souter's tenure on the Supreme Court was marked by his surprising shift to the left, disappointing conservatives and leading to the phrase 'no more Souters' during subsequent Supreme Court nominations. During his time on the bench, Souter became a champion of individual liberties and often sided with the court's liberal wing on key issues such as abortion rights and the separation of church and state.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute is presenting 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,' an exhibition curated by Monica L. Miller and Andrew Bolton, showcasing 300 years of Black sartorial history. The exhibition features garments, accessories, paintings, videos, and sketches, juxtaposing contemporary designs from Black-led brands with historical garments. Themes such as 'Distinction,' 'Jook,' 'Cool,' and 'Heritage' explore the evolution of the African diaspora's influence on fashion. A key piece in the exhibition is Frederick Douglass's tailcoat, symbolizing the power and eloquence of his voice and the broader significance of Black Americans' ability to express themselves through clothing.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached an agreement to reduce or remove tariffs on certain goods traded between the two countries, although it is not a full trade deal. Key aspects of the agreement include a reduction in car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, the removal of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US, and continued negotiations on pharmaceuticals. The deal does not change the UK's digital services tax, which remains a point of contention, and maintains existing food standards, preventing the import of hormone-treated beef.</p>

          <p>Following a recent trade deal with the US, the UK government has affirmed that hormone-treated beef will not be permitted for import, despite concerns from farmers and consumers. The government insists that existing food standards will remain unchanged, and border checks will be conducted to ensure compliance. While the deal allows for increased beef imports from the US up to 13,000 metric tons tariff-free, the UK will also be able to sell more beef to the US at reduced tariffs. The agreement also includes provisions for lower tariffs on UK-made cars and US ethanol exports.</p>

          <p>Two men, Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, have been found guilty of criminal damage for cutting down the iconic Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland, an act that sparked international outrage. The tree, which stood for over a century next to Hadrian's Wall, was felled in a 'moronic mission' in September 2023, with the act filmed on Graham's phone. The National Trust, which owned the tree, expressed its shock at the 'needless' felling, but noted that saplings grown from the tree will be distributed to charities and organizations across the country.</p>

Putin used the event to emphasize Russia's commitment to defending its national interests and traditional values, linking past victories with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The parade was the largest since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the display of military might contrasted with the country's limited gains on the battlefield and slowing economy.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is projected to make an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in orbit. The spacecraft, originally intended to land on Venus, suffered a rocket malfunction and never left Earth's orbit. Experts estimate that the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, with a small chance of hitting someone or something. While most of the spacecraft is expected to burn up upon re-entry, there is a possibility that a portion could survive and impact the Earth's surface.</p>

          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to implement new rules for player registration to increase playing time for Japanese players. Starting from the 2026-27 season, at least eight of the 15 players on each team must meet specific criteria, such as being Japanese-born, and be on the field simultaneously during a match. The existing rules have three categories for players, and each side must have at least 11 Category A players eligible for the Japanese national team on the pitch at the same time.</p>

          <p>A recent study found that the deadly storms in the central Mississippi valley in April were made more likely and severe by the burning of fossil fuels. The rainfall was about 9% more intense and 40% more likely due to human-caused climate change, and warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by the climate crisis, contributed to the storm's moisture. The study also notes that cuts and staff layoffs to the National Weather Service could have led to a worse outcome, had it not been for their around-the-clock forecasting and early warnings.</p>
