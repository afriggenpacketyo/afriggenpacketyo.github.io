          <p>Tensions flared in Los Angeles following immigration sweeps, sparking protests against the Trump administration and ICE. Trump deployed Marines and National Guard troops to support federal efforts, drawing criticism from California's Governor Newsom, who called it a "deranged fantasy." The White House aims to increase arrest and deportation numbers, with Deputy Chief of Staff Miller pushing for 3,000 arrests daily. Advocates claim families are being torn apart, while others express concern over tactics. The unrest has led to looting and clashes, with authorities using rubber bullets and tear gas. </p>

          <p>Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amid protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily focused on protecting federal buildings and personnel.

          <p>President Trump has authorized deploying another 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, escalating tensions with California Governor Newsom, who is suing Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth over the initial deployment. Newsom criticized the move as reckless and pointless, alleging that the first troops deployed lacked adequate supplies. The ACLU condemned the mobilization of the Marines, questioning their training for policing protests while respecting constitutional rights. Trump also suggested arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions, further intensifying the conflict. </p>

          <p>The girlfriend of Derrick Groves, one of the inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail last month, has been arrested for allegedly aiding in his escape. Darriana Burton, a former correctional employee, is accused of relaying escape-related information and coordinating communications between Groves and people outside the jail. Authorities claim Burton had an active role in the planning phase, including a FaceTime call where an unknown man advised against the escape. Groves, convicted of two counts of second-degree murder, remains at large, and the reward for his arrest has increased to $50,000. </p>

          <p>The confrontation between President Trump and California Governor Newsom intensified after Trump suggested Newsom should be arrested for obstructing immigration enforcement. Newsom responded by accusing Trump of acting like a dictator and taking steps toward authoritarianism. The dispute stems from Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to California without Newsom's consent, prompting a lawsuit from the state. House Speaker Johnson expressed support for Trump's decision, while Homan clarified that there had been no discussion about arresting Newsom. </p>

          <p>A report by UK MPs has deemed the country's statutory parental leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. Currently, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving £187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The government is conducting a review to explore how best to support working families. </p>

The Department for Education emphasizes that AI should only be used for low-stakes marking and that teachers must always check its results. Teachers are also permitted to use AI to generate routine letters to parents, such as those regarding head lice outbreaks. While some educators see this as a moral responsibility due to pupils already using AI, others warn of risks such as data breaches and errors. </p>
