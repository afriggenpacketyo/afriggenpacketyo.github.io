        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, this article analyzes the profound political polarization gripping the United States. It argues that the nation is in a perilous state, as the political and media ecosystems often reward extremism and outrage rather than promoting unity and de-escalation. The author reflects on past tragedies that failed to bring Americans together, suggesting the current incentive structures make reconciliation exceptionally difficult. The piece questions whether the U.S. can escape its cycle of division, especially as social media amplifies hostility and leaders on both sides retreat to conflicting narratives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for an indefinite period after the host made controversial comments linking the man accused of killing Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The decision followed pressure from the FCC and a move by Nexstar Media Group, a major owner of ABC affiliate stations, to preempt the show. While a person familiar with the matter stated Kimmel has not been fired, the suspension has ignited a significant debate about free speech and corporate responsibility. Political figures and unions have weighed in, with some condemning the move as censorship and others praising ABC for its decision.</p>

          <p>At a global public security forum, China displayed advanced police equipment, including body cameras enhanced with artificial intelligence and facial recognition capabilities. The technology, showcased to developing nations, can link to a database of high-risk individuals and send real-time alerts to a central command center during patrols. A vendor explained that the system allows for the rapid identification and dispatch of officers to a suspect's location using a map-based interface. The equipment is part of a broader exhibition of Chinese security technology, which also includes drones, counterterrorism gear, and protective equipment, highlighting the country's focus on integrated, intelligent policing solutions.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests, to be deported to either Algeria or Syria. The ruling states that Khalil misrepresented his background on his green card application, thereby forfeiting his right to remain in the U.S. Khalil's lawyers argue the decision is retaliation from the Trump administration for his activism and free speech, alleging procedural irregularities in the case. They plan to appeal the ruling, which represents a significant development in the administration's broader effort to penalize foreign students linked to campus protests against Israeli policies.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center indicate the storm will remain over open water for several days, posing no immediate threat to land. However, meteorologists predict Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it tracks northwest, potentially passing north of the Caribbean. While its path remains uncertain, the system could approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen, with projected wind speeds possibly reaching 85 mph by early next week.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies has unveiled a new supernode computing cluster that it claims can deliver world-class AI computing power without relying on advanced chips from Nvidia. This development is a significant step toward China's goal of technological self-reliance and could challenge the U.S. chokehold on high-end AI hardware. The company's rotating chairman, Xu Zhijun, stated the solution uses chip manufacturing processes available within China to meet growing computational demands. The announcement coincides with Beijing reportedly urging its tech firms to cease purchasing Nvidia chips specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, signaling an escalation in the tech war.</p>

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell characterized the cut as a risk management measure rather than a response to a weakening economy, and the central bank signaled that more cuts could be forthcoming.

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates, analysts predict that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will likely adopt a cautious approach with only moderate monetary easing for the remainder of the year. While the Fed's move provides more room for China to act, the PBOC is expected to prioritize currency stability, setting the yuan's midpoint rate slightly weaker. Economists suggest that a smaller rate cut pace from the PBOC compared to the Fed will help narrow the interest rate gap, which could ease capital outflow pressures and provide support for the yuan's value against the US dollar.

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his intention to designate the anti-fascist movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The announcement, made via social media, raises legal and practical questions, as antifa is a decentralized movement rather than a formal entity, and there is no domestic equivalent to the foreign terror organization list. This move fulfills a long-standing promise by the president, who has often blamed antifa for violence at protests. Critics and legal experts have pointed out that such a designation would face significant First Amendment hurdles and deviates from how domestic groups are typically handled by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This article explores the critical role of music in setting the tone and conveying the narrative of collections at New York Fashion Week. The author argues that the soundtrack is crucial information, telling the audience how to feel about the clothes and making the presentation more memorable. From original compositions featuring whispered poetry at Campillo to the layered, Nuyorican-inspired beats at Eckhaus Latta, music acts as a journey for the audience. The analysis highlights how different designers used sound to evoke specific emotions, whether it was the nostalgic indie rock at Anna Sui or the disorienting, politically charged soundscape at Collina Strada.</p>

          <p>The Central Council of Jews in Germany has publicly called on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government to continue its "unconditional" support for Israel. During an event marking the council's 75th anniversary, its president, Josef Schuster, urged German leaders not to be swayed from this path by other nations or internal political pressure. Chancellor Merz, who was in attendance, stated that while criticism of the Israeli government must be possible, it should not serve as a pretext for antisemitism. He reaffirmed Germany's commitment to Israel and the importance of Jewish life to the nation's future, highlighting the government's role as a key supporter since the Gaza conflict began.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published a report strongly refuting the Trump administration's dismissal of climate change dangers, stating the evidence is "beyond scientific dispute." The report directly challenges the EPA's move to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," which classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat requiring regulation. The scientists concluded that the 2009 finding is now bolstered by even stronger evidence, warning that the U.S. faces a future of worsening climate-induced harm. This publication represents a powerful counter-narrative from the scientific community against the administration's policy direction on climate.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend has issued a sincere apology after facing backlash for social media posts criticizing unfamiliar foods offered at a tournament in China. In a now-deleted video, Townsend expressed shock at seeing dishes that included bullfrogs and turtles, which led to accusations of cultural insensitivity from Chinese social media users. In a new video, the world's top-ranked doubles player stated there was "no excuse" for her comments and that she would be better. She emphasized her privilege to travel the world and experience different cultures, noting that her time in China has otherwise been an amazing experience.</p>

          <p>The University of California's board of regents has approved requests from five campuses to increase their stockpiles of weapons and equipment, including thousands of rifle rounds and pepper-ball projectiles. The annual request comes as UC's handling of campus protests faces scrutiny. The equipment, which also includes drones and non-lethal sponge foam rounds, is classified as "military equipment" under state law. A UC spokesperson stated the items are essential for de-escalating situations and ensuring public safety, but some faculty members expressed concern that the weapons will be used against students and staff exercising their right to protest.</p>

          <p>Prime Video has announced that its popular young adult series, "The Summer I Turned Pretty," will conclude with a feature film rather than a traditional final season.

The series, which follows a complex love triangle between a teenage girl and two brothers, has become a global hit with a passionate fanbase.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists tested figs and plum-like fruits favored by the chimps and found an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. While not enough to cause intoxication, the steady, low-dose exposure supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of primate ancestors. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in fruits regularly consumed by wild chimps.</p>

The committee also recommended establishing new national minimum standards for special needs support in schools and providing more training for teachers. This comes as the government prepares to announce reforms for a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable despite a rising number of children requiring EHCPs for support.</p>
