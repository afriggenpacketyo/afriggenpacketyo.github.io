          <p>Colombian police, in a coordinated operation with European authorities, have arrested an alleged leader of Italy's 'ndrangheta mafia in Bogotá. The suspect, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, was wanted under an Interpol red notice for his role in overseeing large cocaine shipments from South America to Europe. According to officials, Palermo managed trafficking routes and was part of one of the mafia's most secretive and powerful cells. The arrest highlights the 'ndrangheta's extensive global reach and the ongoing efforts to combat transnational organized crime.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 win against American Amanda Anisimova in a match lasting just 57 minutes. This marked the first "double bagel" victory in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's mastery on grass, a surface previously considered her weakest. The win represents Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova's performance was hampered by nerves, but her journey to the final was celebrated as a remarkable comeback after taking a break for her mental health.</p>

          <p>Police in London and Cardiff arrested a total of 55 people on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organization during protests against the UK government's decision to ban Palestine Action. The group was recently classified as a terrorist organization under the Terrorism Act 2000, making support for it a criminal offense. The ban followed an incident where activists painted aircraft at an RAF base, for which the group claimed responsibility. Protesters argue the ban is an "authoritarian abuse" of power, while the government maintains the group's escalating criminal activities pose a risk to national security.</p>

The announcement marks a significant escalation in trade policy, impacting major U.S. trading partners and potentially disrupting global supply chains. Both Mexico and the EU have expressed disagreement and indicated they will take necessary steps to protect their interests, including possible countermeasures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash reveals that both of the aircraft's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff, causing a total loss of engine power. Cockpit audio recorded one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so, leaving investigators to determine who acted and why. The switches are designed with safety features to prevent accidental activation, making the event highly unusual. This finding raises critical questions about whether the action was intentional, a result of confusion, or a technical malfunction.</p>

This strategy, dating back to the 1930s, helps preserve cash flow and can reduce the tax burden.

          <p>An investigation has found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) repeatedly approved requests to remove dozens of buildings at Camp Mystic from its 100-year flood map in the years leading up to the recent catastrophic flood. This re-designation loosened regulatory oversight and insurance requirements for the camp, which operated and expanded in a known flood plain. Experts find it "disturbing" that a camp responsible for children would seek such exemptions in a high-risk area. While the flood was more severe than a 100-year event, the findings raise questions about the camp's risk management and FEMA's map amendment process.</p>

          <p>Chris Kirby, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, has built his company, Ithaca Hummus, into a major brand expected to generate $50 million in revenue this year. Starting a decade ago while a student at Cornell, Kirby identified a "culinary gap" for fresh hummus and launched his business at a local farmers market with minimal startup costs, including a $450 blender. By focusing on slow, deep growth in existing markets rather than rapid expansion, the company maintained product quality and built a strong reputation. Kirby has maintained control by avoiding venture capital, allowing the business to grow profitably and on its own terms.</p>

The designation also includes Herrenchiemsee Palace, Linderhof Castle, and the King's House on Schachen, all built in the 19th century. These sites are already major tourist attractions in Germany, drawing millions of visitors annually, and the new status is expected to further boost their international profile.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Military experts suggest that Russia's recent escalation of drone and missile attacks on Ukraine is part of a broader strategy to overwhelm air defenses and terrorize the civilian population. By expanding its domestic drone production and receiving parts from allies, Russia can now sustain a high tempo of combined assaults. Analysts believe the goals are twofold: to destroy Ukraine's military-industrial capacity and to pressure the Ukrainian government by weakening public morale. The stepped-up campaign is seen as a potential precursor to a new Russian summer offensive aimed at breaking Ukraine's defenses.</p>

          <p>Top European Union officials have vowed to respond to President Trump's announcement of a 30% tariff on all EU goods, set to begin August 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the EU would take all "necessary steps" to safeguard its interests, including "proportionate countermeasures," while remaining open to negotiations. Leaders from Germany, France, and Italy echoed this sentiment, calling the move concerning and emphasizing the need for a united European front.

          <p>Following President Trump's visit to flood-ravaged central Texas, political analysts are examining his administration's approach to federal disaster response. Panelists on "Washington Week" noted that while Trump can be effective at mobilizing resources, his style often lacks the personal empathy and connection with victims that past presidents have demonstrated. The discussion highlighted that the current administration appears to favor a scaled-back federal role, relying more heavily on state and local officials to manage crises. This represents a potential shift in how the federal government engages with communities during natural disasters.</p>

          <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump stated he was considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time adversary, Rosie O'Donnell, calling her a "Threat to Humanity." Legal experts quickly noted that a president cannot revoke the citizenship of a person born in the U.S., as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, responded by calling Trump a "danger to the nation." The incident is the latest example of the former president using his platform to target critics and challenge established legal and constitutional norms.</p>

Patterson suggests that Kohberger, despite his criminal justice studies, succumbed to "tunnel vision" and panic, leading him to make a critical mistake by leaving a knife sheath at the scene. This error ultimately led to his arrest for the murders of four University of Idaho students, to which he has now pleaded guilty.

Historically, third parties in the U.S. have succeeded by influencing the platforms of major parties rather than by winning seats.

The author, a trans woman who transitioned in adulthood, argues against forcing children to wait for gender-affirming care by countering the "survivorship bias" of those who, like her, made it through without it. The article likens skepticism about trans care to doubt-casting on climate change and emphasizes that social acceptance is a key part of care. It suggests listening to trans people's experiences is crucial to understanding the issue.</p>
