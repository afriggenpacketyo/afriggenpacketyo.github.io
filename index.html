          <p>Two Israeli Embassy employees, identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, was apprehended shortly after the incident and chanted "Free, Free Palestine" while in custody. The victims were reportedly a couple about to be engaged, with the young man having purchased a ring with plans to propose in Jerusalem. President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu condemned the attack, calling it antisemitic, and instructed Israeli missions worldwide to enhance security measures. The FBI is investigating the shooting, with early indicators suggesting it was a targeted act of violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's plan to finalize a deal handing the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily blocked by a High Court injunction. The legal action was brought by two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, who argue that the government failed to consult with the Chagossian people, who were displaced from the islands in the late 1960s and early 1970s to allow the US to build a military base. The agreement would permit the UK and US to continue using the military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years, with the UK expected to make multi-billion pound payments to Mauritius. The court will rehear the case, with representatives of the Chagossian community meeting with Foreign Office officials for discussions.</p>

The company's shares have risen significantly, driven by the popularity of the Labubu character from "The Monsters" series, which has boosted overseas sales. JPMorgan Chase initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, projecting substantial growth in global revenue and gross merchandise value. Pop Mart's success is attributed to its ability to cultivate intellectual property that resonates with Generation Z consumers.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of animals, including tigers, elephants, lions, and monkeys, have been evacuated from the Ostok Sanctuary in CuliacÃ¡n, Sinaloa, Mexico, due to escalating cartel violence. Staff members faced threats and gunfire from rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, leading to a breakdown of law and order in the region. Some of the animals, previously kept as pets by drug lords, suffered from stress and lack of food during the crisis.

          <p>A Maryland man's deportation to El Salvador sparked a fierce debate among officials in the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department, and State Department, even after it was acknowledged that a mistake had occurred. The Trump administration deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia despite a judge's ruling prohibiting his deportation to El Salvador, prompting discussions among officials on how to manage the situation. D.H.S. officials considered portraying Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader and attempting to nullify the order barring his deportation. The case has become a major test of President Trumpâ€™s mass deportation efforts, with Abrego Garcia remaining imprisoned in El Salvador despite court rulings demanding his release.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other experts are questioning the effectiveness of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China, arguing that they have been a failure and are causing more harm to American businesses. These restrictions, aimed at curbing China's military advancement and protecting U.S. dominance in AI, have instead incentivized China to become self-sufficient in semiconductor technology. Huang noted that Nvidia's GPU market share in China has fallen significantly, and experts believe the curbs have accelerated the development of local alternatives like Huawei. Concerns are rising that the restrictions are causing collateral damage and hindering U.S. companies' ability to compete in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Government borrowing in the UK was higher than expected in April, reaching Â£20.2 billion, Â£1 billion higher than April of the previous year. This figure is the fourth highest since monthly records began in 1993, leading experts to predict potential tax rises in the autumn. Tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, but government expenditure also rose because of pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is estimated at Â£148.3 billion, which is Â£3.7 billion less than initially estimated but still Â£11 billion more than expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>

Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability.
