          <p>A Maryland man with protected legal status was mistakenly deported to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison due to an ICE 'administrative error'.  The man, Kilmer Armado Abrego-Garcia, has a U.S. citizen wife and child and is now the subject of a lawsuit seeking his return. The government acknowledges the error but claims it lacks jurisdiction to intervene, citing Abrego-Garcia's prior asylum case involving alleged MS-13 gang affiliations.</p>

          <p>Internal documents reveal that the Trump administration's Department of Energy is targeting California and other blue states for significant budget cuts in clean energy projects.  The cuts disproportionately affect projects funded by Biden's infrastructure law, impacting initiatives like solar power, heat pumps, and hydrogen hubs.  The cuts appear politically motivated, with red states facing far fewer reductions, raising concerns about partisan bias in energy policy.</p>
