        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that federal courts likely exceed their authority when issuing universal injunctions, which block government policies nationwide. The 6-3 decision came in a case challenging President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, allowing the administration to partially enforce the policy while the legal challenges proceed. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, argued that courts should resolve specific cases rather than exercising general oversight of the executive branch. The ruling does not address the legality of the birthright citizenship policy itself but significantly curtails a tool frequently used to halt presidential actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, particularly through comments made by anchor Jesse Watters, falsely reported on a phone call between Newsom and President Donald Trump. Newsom claims Fox News was motivated to misrepresent the conversation to support the president amid a feud over immigration enforcement. The damages sought are notably similar to the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, signaling a direct challenge to the network's reporting standards.</p>

          <p>Tesla recently held a supervised, invite-only launch for its robotaxi service in Austin, which has drawn sharply contrasting reactions. Some participants, including Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, praised the experience as "extremely smooth" and impressive, while others pointed to significant errors, such as a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road. The article highlights Tesla's unique camera-based approach to autonomy, which differs from competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar. This event represents a critical, albeit small-scale, test of Elon Musk's long-standing promises for a fully autonomous shared fleet, with its success still a subject of intense debate.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have confirmed an agreement aimed at speeding up the shipment of rare-earth minerals to the U.S., a key step in de-escalating their ongoing trade war. The deal is part of a framework to implement a prior consensus reached in Geneva, under which China will approve export permits for controlled items while the U.S. eases some countermeasures. This development addresses a significant vulnerability for the U.S., as China dominates the global supply of these critical minerals, which are essential for military equipment and various high-tech industries. The news was received positively by markets, though the long-term resolution of the trade conflict remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index surged to a new record high, marking a significant turnaround from a slump earlier in the year caused by trade war concerns. Investors appear to have set aside worries about tariffs and recent Middle East tensions, propelled by strong corporate earnings and a resilient job market. However, the article notes potential economic headwinds, including a recent report showing a slight decline in consumer spending, a key driver of the economy. The Federal Reserve also remains cautious about cutting interest rates due to the risk that tariffs could reignite inflation, creating a mixed outlook despite the market's current bullishness.

During a recent shareholder meeting, Huang highlighted robotics as the company's next major opportunity after artificial intelligence.

Experts note that despite record seizures, street prices remain stable or have even fallen, indicating a massive increase in supply.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated his government's welfare reforms now strike "the right balance" after making concessions to his own party's MPs. The original plan, aimed at reducing the welfare bill, would have applied stricter criteria for receiving Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to all claimants. Following a significant backbench rebellion, the government agreed that the tougher rules will now only apply to new claimants, not the 3.7 million people currently receiving the benefit. While this move has appeased many potential rebels, some Labour MPs have indicated they will still vote against the revised proposals.</p>

          <p>The federal sex trafficking trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs is concluding, with lawyers making their closing arguments. Over seven weeks, prosecutors called 34 witnesses, including Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura Fine, arguing that he used his power and resources to lead a criminal enterprise involving brutal sex crimes. The prosecution asserted that Combs believed his fame and wealth placed him above the law. In contrast, the defense presented its case in under 30 minutes without calling any witnesses, relying on their cross-examinations of government witnesses. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a potential life sentence if convicted.</p>

Researchers found that approximately 17% of the nearly 200 products tested had incorrect levels of active ingredients, which could lead to treatment failure and disease progression. The problem stems from a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products circulating in a poorly regulated market. While past studies have shown similar issues with other medicines, this is the first systematic report to highlight the high prevalence of defective anticancer drugs in the region.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, an author reflects on the dual nature of Tehran, contrasting the vibrant, visible city of everyday life with an 'invisible city' of state surveillance and control. Drawing from his experiences as a political prisoner, he describes a hidden infrastructure of unmarked military compounds, secret safe houses, and intelligence offices disguised as ordinary buildings. This parallel city, he argues, is structural to the Islamic Republic's power, operating through fear and concealment. The recent Israeli airstrikes, the author contends, briefly illuminated this hidden architecture of power, exposing the regime's embedded military and intelligence assets to the world.</p>

The potential move is fueled by Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' perceived strength heading into the 2026 regulation changes, creating a tense dynamic within the sport.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is urging Americans to contact lawmakers to ensure passage of his administration's major legislative package, which he says fulfills key campaign promises. Despite a setback in the Senate where a Medicaid provision was rejected by the parliamentarian, the White House insists it is sticking to its goal of having the bill ready to sign by Independence Day. At a rally, Trump touted the bill's provisions for border funding and eliminating taxes on tips. Meanwhile, House leaders met to discuss enhancing security for members following a recent assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and other threats.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article examines how the persistent threat of assassination by Iran has affected President Donald Trump and his administration's policies. Federal authorities have briefed campaign leaders on evolving Iranian plots, and the Justice Department has unsealed indictments describing disrupted schemes against U.S. officials, including Trump himself. The fear has reportedly altered security protocols, with the president publicly acknowledging the danger. While White House officials state that decisions on Iran are based on national interest, some allies privately wonder how much the personal risk is shaping the president's thinking on the current conflict and military actions.</p>

          <p>Experts are divided on the value of purchasing whole life insurance for children as a financial planning tool. Proponents argue it locks in low premiums and guarantees future insurability, which is beneficial if a child later develops a health condition, and provides a death benefit for final expenses in a tragedy. However, critics contend that the coverage is statistically unnecessary for healthy children and that the cash value component offers poor returns compared to other investment vehicles like 529 plans or brokerage accounts. The article suggests that the decision depends heavily on a family's specific financial goals and concerns about future health risks.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is selling a portion of its holdings in Disney (DIS) following the stock's significant rebound to over $120 per share. The article explains the move as a matter of discipline, taking profits after the stock outperformed the S&P 500 this year, gaining about 9%. Despite the sale and a downgrade to a 'hold' rating, the club remains positive on CEO Bob Iger's turnaround plan, citing improving profitability and consistent growth in its experiences segment. The sale will realize a loss on some shares but reflects an overall gain on the total position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Research Team Identifies 'Genetic Switch' for Tissue Regeneration in Mammals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 09:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a key genetic pathway that could enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capacity largely lost in their evolution. The research, published in the journal Science, found that mice fail to regenerate because they cannot produce enough retinoic acid, a crucial compound for tissue repair. This is due to the deactivation of a specific DNA "switch." By reactivating this dormant genetic switch, the scientists were able to successfully trigger ear tissue regeneration in a mouse. This discovery could play a significant role in advancing regenerative medicine for various tissue types in vertebrates, including humans.</p>

          <h2>Potential Addition of Crypto and Private Equity to 401(k)s Stirs Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 09:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential inclusion of new investment options like cryptocurrency and private equity in 401(k) plans is generating controversy among financial experts. Following the Labor Department's rescission of cautionary guidance on crypto and reported White House interest in private equity, advocates argue these additions could 'democratize' access to high-return assets. However, many investor advocates express concern, citing the high fees, lack of transparency, and illiquidity of private equity, as well as the volatility and short track record of crypto. They warn these assets may be too risky and complex for the average person's core retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>
