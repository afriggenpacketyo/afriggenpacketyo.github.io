        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new spending package signed by President Trump includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, raising concerns about its impact on the pharmaceutical industry. While the program represents a fraction of total revenue for most drugmakers, certain companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead are more exposed due to their reliance on Medicaid for key products. Analysts note that the financial effects on these companies will likely not be felt until 2027. The bill also contains a provision exempting more drugs from Medicare price negotiations, which benefits the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that over half of Gen Z and millennials are engaging in 'vibe-based budgeting,' adjusting their financial habits based on their feelings about the economy rather than their personal situation. This trend, fueled by anxiety over inflation and a potential recession, is shifting consumer behavior from post-pandemic 'revenge spending' to 'revenge saving.' Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial decisions, instead recommending intentional strategies like reverse budgeting and setting up separate accounts for specific goals to build wealth more effectively.

          <p>A State Department cable has revealed that an unidentified actor used artificial intelligence to create a fake Signal account impersonating Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The impersonator contacted at least five high-level individuals, including foreign ministers, a U.S. governor, and a member of Congress. In some instances, the actor sent AI-generated voicemails and text messages in an attempt to engage with the targets. The State Department has confirmed it is aware of the incident and has launched an investigation into the sophisticated impersonation attempt.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant rally in its stock price, an analyst at BMO Capital has raised the price target for GE Vernova, suggesting the company still has room for growth. The firm highlights nearly $80 billion in incremental service-related revenue that is insulated from potential declines in turbine equipment demand. Investment commentator Jim Cramer echoed this sentiment, stating that accounting changes in new legislation and potential overseas orders could further bolster the company's prospects and justify expansion of its U.S. production capacity.

A key piece of evidence in the trial was audio from a neighbor's security camera that captured sounds of a loud argument, including a woman's voice yelling phrases like 'So f****** die.' Turner claimed she acted in self-defense after Trussler strangled her, but prosecutors argued that video from an in-home camera showed him walking calmly and unarmed.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center survey conducted across 25 countries reveals a complex global perception of the United States. In the poll, the U.S. was more frequently named as the most important ally compared to China. However, the U.S. was also more likely to be cited as the greatest threat. In several countries, including Canada, Indonesia, and Mexico, respondents named the United States as both their nation's top ally and its primary threat, highlighting a dualistic view of American influence on the world stage.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has put forward a bill that would allow for the reintroduction of military conscription under specific circumstances. The plan would empower the government, with parliamentary approval, to call up conscripts if the defense situation requires a rapid expansion of the armed forces. This move is a response to the altered security landscape in Europe and is seen as a compromise between calls for full compulsory service and opposition to the draft. The proposal also aims to make voluntary service more financially attractive to boost recruitment.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly floods in central Texas, conspiracy theories blaming 'cloud seeding' for the disaster have circulated widely on social media, amplified by some political figures. However, meteorological experts and atmospheric scientists have unequivocally dismissed these claims as false. They explain that cloud seeding can only slightly enhance rainfall in existing clouds and is physically incapable of creating the massive weather system that caused the catastrophic flooding. Furthermore, any particles from seeding operations conducted two days prior would have dispersed long before the storm hit.</p>

Additionally, President Trump threatened a dozen other nations with steep new import duties, with rates ranging from 25% to as high as 40% for countries like Myanmar and Laos. The move follows the expiration of a 90-day tariff freeze and signals a hardline approach to trade negotiations. Economists warn that these wide-ranging tariffs could fuel inflation and negatively impact economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors argued the attack was carried out on behalf of the Russian mercenary Wagner Group, which the UK has designated a terrorist organization. The plot was orchestrated by two other men who had already pleaded guilty. The attack, which caused around £1 million in damage, is a clear example of a foreign state-linked entity using British citizens as 'proxies' to conduct serious criminal activity in the UK.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged ten people with attempted murder following an alleged ambush on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Alvarado, Texas. The incident occurred on July 4th, when attackers allegedly used fireworks and vandalism to lure agents out of a detention center. A local police officer was shot in the neck, and a gunman fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed ICE officers. Authorities described the event as a 'planned ambush with the intent to kill' and later found tactical gear and weapons with the apprehended suspects.</p>

          <p>India has suspended its participation in the six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, escalating tensions and deepening fears of water scarcity in the region. The treaty, which governs the division of the Indus River network, has survived previous wars but is now a major flashpoint. Pakistan, an arid country heavily dependent on the Indus for agriculture and power, accuses India of 'weaponizing water' and considers any diversion an act of war. The move comes as both nuclear-armed nations face increasing water stress due to climate change and growing populations.</p>
