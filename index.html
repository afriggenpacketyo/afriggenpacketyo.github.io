          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of his peace talks with Vladimir Putin, urging him to ensure Ukraine's right to self-determination is respected. The appeal comes after Trump suggested both sides would need to cede territory, raising concerns that he might make concessions to Russia at Ukraine's expense. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces report minor territorial gains in the eastern Sumy region, having recaptured two villages from Russian invaders. The situation remains tense as the international community awaits the outcome of the high-stakes U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the implementation of significant tariff hikes. Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what the White House calls "unfair trade practices." Despite the temporary relief, some U.S. business owners express frustration over the prolonged uncertainty, which complicates long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level in over two years, while also downgrading the country's annual economic growth forecast to 1.7%. The RBA cited a substantial drop in inflation and weaker-than-expected public demand as key factors for the decision. While the bank noted that the risk of a major global trade war has diminished, it warned that the lower GDP outlook is primarily due to reduced productivity growth expectations.

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along Western Australia's coast have experienced their most severe bleaching event ever recorded, following an unprecedented marine heatwave. The damage spans 1,500 kilometers and affects previously resilient areas like the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef. Researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science attribute the event to record-high ocean temperatures driven by climate change. The UN has warned that even with significant global action on emissions, a vast majority of the world's tropical coral reefs are projected to die.</p>

She writes about facing misogyny throughout her career and her belief that Scotland will achieve independence within two decades.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old missing person case was solved after a woman's new boyfriend confessed to killing a cyclist and burying the body. The man, Alexander McKellar, admitted to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he and his twin brother had fatally struck cyclist Tony Parsons in a hit-and-run in 2017. When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later alerted the police. The victim's family expressed immense gratitude for her actions, which led to the recovery of the body and brought them a measure of closure.</p>

          <p>Recent surveys in Israel reveal a complex public sentiment regarding the ongoing conflict in Gaza. A growing majority of Israelis, now at 74% according to one poll, support a deal with Hamas to secure the release of all remaining hostages, even if it means ending the war. However, the same research indicates a significant lack of concern for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with 79% of Jewish Israelis reporting they are not troubled by reports of famine and suffering. This highlights a deep disconnect, where the desire to bring hostages home coexists with widespread indifference to the plight of Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that thousands of North Koreans are being sent to work in Russia under conditions described as modern-day slavery, filling a labor shortage caused by the war in Ukraine. Escapees detailed grueling 18-hour workdays on construction sites with minimal pay, as the majority of their earnings are confiscated by the North Korean regime. South Korean intelligence suggests over 10,000 laborers were sent to Russia last year in violation of UN sanctions, with many more expected. The report highlights a tightening of control by Pyongyang to prevent escapes, trapping workers in what they describe as a "prison without bars."</p>

          <p>Spain is taking a notably independent foreign policy stance, creating friction with the Trump administration by renouncing U.S. F-35 fighter jet purchases and resisting pressure to meet NATO's new 5% defense spending target. The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, is also pursuing closer economic ties with China, including awarding a contract to Huawei. Analysts suggest this strategy is a rare instance of a European nation openly antagonizing President Trump, a gamble that could distract from domestic political issues but also carries potential risks despite Spain's protection under the EU's collective trade agreements.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that a specific knee-replacement implant, the NexGen stemmed tibial component, was used in thousands of UK operations for years after its manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, was aware of its high failure rate.

Patients have reported severe pain, mobility loss, and addiction to painkillers after the implant slipped out of place, with hundreds requiring corrective surgery.

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub, has announced he is leaving the company to "become a founder again." His departure comes as GitHub, a dominant platform for software developers, faces intensifying competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools. Dohmke has led the company since 2021, overseeing the launch of its popular AI coding assistant, Copilot. Microsoft has not yet named a successor, and GitHub's leadership team will now report to an executive within Microsoft's broader CoreAI group, signaling a deeper integration into the parent company's AI strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The move comes shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which he claimed without evidence was manipulated. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has defended Trump's economic policies. The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, has raised concerns among some economists about the potential politicization of the independent federal statistical agency.

He argued that instead of simply trying to curb intense competition, known as 'neijuan', the focus should be on preventing excessive cash burn and destructive price wars. Wang emphasized that the goal should be to elevate competition through innovation, quality improvements, and a better industrial ecosystem. This approach could help the rapid delivery sector become a sustainable new driver for consumer spending and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The girl was doing chores in her backyard when the animal bit her, causing injuries to her arm, leg, and back. Her family scared the mountain lion away after hearing her screams, and she was taken to a hospital for treatment. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located the mountain lion in nearby brush and killed it. Wildlife officials noted that while such attacks are rare, the home is located near the big cats' natural habitat.</p>

          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its more remote regions, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing permit fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. The fee-free mountains are located in the country's less-developed western provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for Mount Everest to $15,000 during peak season, the first hike in nearly a decade. Officials hope the move will attract more mountaineers to unexplored areas, creating jobs and strengthening local economies, though questions about infrastructure in these regions remain.</p>

The chase began with the carjacking of a pickup truck, followed by the theft of a big rig, which the suspects drove the wrong way on the 10 Freeway. After abandoning the semi-truck, they carjacked a third vehicle before finally disappearing near a freeway underpass. A loaded firearm was recovered from the first stolen truck, and authorities believe additional suspects may have assisted in the final escape.</p>

The fear is impacting the local economy, with an expected drop in sales tax revenue that funds community services.

The unusual move to dismiss the case post-conviction was initiated after a new U.S. Attorney was appointed and had previously triggered the resignation of several prosecutors in protest of the office's handling of the case.</p>
