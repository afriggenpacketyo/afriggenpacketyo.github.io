        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has issued a statement affirming it will abide by any court decision regarding President Trump's attempt to remove Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. The central bank emphasized that Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, dictates that governors serve long, fixed terms and may only be removed by the president "for cause." Cook's personal attorney plans to promptly challenge this action in court, arguing Trump has no legal or factual basis for the removal. The Fed underscored that such tenure protections are vital safeguards, ensuring monetary policy decisions remain independent, based on data, and focused on the long-term interests of the American people, amidst escalating political pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith have strongly defended his conduct against an ethics probe into his investigations of President Trump, labeling the accusations as "imaginary and unfounded." The Office of the Special Counsel, a separate federal agency, launched the probe into potential Hatch Act violations concerning Smith's handling of cases related to classified documents and the 2020 election. Smith's attorneys asserted that he was fiercely committed to evidence-based prosecutorial decisions, followed DOJ guidelines, and did not allow political influence to sway his actions. They argued that the investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that inappropriately suggests justice should yield to political contests, which is antithetical to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook plans to file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's order for her removal, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over the central bank's independence. Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud as his "for cause" reason, while Cook's lawyer asserts the president lacks the authority for such an action without established cause. The Federal Reserve itself weighed in, stating that governors serve fixed terms and can only be removed "for cause," a safeguard for monetary policy. This unprecedented move by Trump intensifies pressure on the Fed, potentially impacting investor confidence and US borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>Okta, an identity software maker, saw its shares rise after reporting fiscal results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. CEO Todd McKinnon attributed the strong performance to economic conditions being "better than we thought," despite increased scrutiny from U.S. government customers following the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency. The article notes the company's net retention rate remained stable and McKinnon anticipates future growth from the need for identity management software for AI agents and selling software suites. Okta also announced the acquisition of Axiom Security and provided an optimistic fiscal 2026 forecast, exceeding analyst consensus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard offloaded over 76,000 pounds of illegal drugs, including cocaine and marijuana, in Florida, marking the largest single drug seizure in its history. Valued at $473 million, the immense quantity of cocaine alone could potentially deliver 23 million lethal doses, underscoring the significant threat posed by transnational drug trafficking to the nation. This successful operation, dubbed "Operation Pacific Viper," is a key part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to disrupt drug cartel activity in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea before illicit substances reach American shores. Various U.S. and international agencies, including the U.S. Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy, participated in the 19 interdictions that led to this record haul, resulting in the detention of 34 suspected drug traffickers.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has pulled an additional $175 million from California's high-speed rail project, just a month after canceling $4 billion in federal grants. Duffy criticized the project as a "boondoggle," citing $15 billion in costs with no tracks laid in twenty years, and vowed to cease federal investment in what he called a "failed experiment." The funding cuts impact track extensions, design work, and a rail station, prompting California to file a lawsuit against the Department of Transportation.

The ruling criticized the administration's repeated attacks on judges who rule against its agenda, highlighting concerns about the interplay between the executive and judicial branches.

Opting for a reverse mortgage also eliminates concerns about the volatile interest rate climate, as it avoids variable rates seen in HELOCs.

          <p>President Trump publicly demanded "nothing less than $500m from Harvard" as a condition for restoring billions in federal funding, continuing his administration's feud with the Ivy League university. The dispute stems from government allegations that Harvard has not adequately addressed antisemitism linked to pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard previously sued the administration for unlawfully slashing $2.6 billion in research funding, arguing it was retaliation for not complying with demands related to campus protests and academic policies. Reports of a potential $500 million settlement have emerged, which Harvard's president disputes, affirming commitment to resolving the matter through courts and protecting academic freedom.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the BBC questions the deliverability and cost-effectiveness of Reform UK's ambitious migration plan, which proposes mass deportations and significant changes to human rights laws. The party aims to deport 500,000-600,000 people within a single Parliament, requiring facilities for 24,000 monthly deportations. The article highlights that such targets are far beyond any government's historical achievements, with the proposed detention facilities potentially costing £12 billion—six times Reform's estimate. Legal experts note that fast-tracking removals would face sustained constitutional challenges, requiring extensive new laws and potentially breaching international treaties like the ECHR, with significant diplomatic and economic consequences.</p>

          <p>For millions of Americans, September presents challenges with steep credit card payments, driven by near-record average APRs of 22% and total balances exceeding $1.2 trillion. This article provides actionable strategies for those struggling to afford payments, emphasizing the importance of immediate action to avoid late fees and credit score damage. Recommended steps include contacting credit card companies for hardship programs, exploring credit counseling and debt management plans for negotiated rates, and carefully considering balance transfers to 0% introductory APR cards.

          <p>President Trump's statement that he would allow 600,000 Chinese students into American universities has surprised and drawn backlash from his loyal conservative base, including figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Steve Bannon. This position marks a departure from his administration's previous restrictive visa policies and increased vetting for foreign students. Trump defended his stance by arguing that Chinese students are "honored" guests and help keep U.S. colleges afloat, a view supported by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick who cited economic benefits. However, critics within his "America First" base questioned the policy's consistency and its implications for national security and American students.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential movement of gold prices in September 2025, noting the precious metal's significant surge of 64% since early 2024, despite a recent dip from record highs. Predicting gold's price is complex due to various influencing factors. There's a chance prices could fall if August inflation declines, given gold's inverse relationship with inflation, which would reduce the need for alternative assets. However, if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, which is increasingly likely, gold prices could rise, as lower rates typically increase demand for the metal. The article advises investors seeking inflation hedges or diversification to consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest regardless of short-term price changes.
