          <p>Blue Origin launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space, marking the company's twelfth crewed flight. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and enjoyed views of space before returning to Earth. The New Shepard rocket reached an altitude of nearly 65 miles, just above the internationally recognized boundary of space. The passengers included individuals from the United States, Panama, Canada, and New Zealand, with one passenger's seat sponsored by a Mexican healthcare company. </p>

          <p>Hamas responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, seeking amendments to achieve a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. A senior Hamas official indicated notes and amendments on U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli forces' withdrawal. The U.S. envoy to the Middle East called Hamas' response "totally unacceptable". A draft of the deal included Israel releasing prisoners and allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. The U.N.

          <p>The film and TV industry in California is facing increasing uncertainty, with concerns about its ability to survive due to job losses and productions moving to other states and countries offering better tax incentives. Television production in the greater Los Angeles area has significantly decreased since its peak in 2021. Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to increase the state's annual film and TV tax credits, but some industry experts question whether it will be enough to offset the high costs of working in California. Many Hollywood workers are struggling to find employment, and are facing difficult financial decisions. </p>

The government has committed to scrutinizing every pound it spends in the Spending Review.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's political resilience is due to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. The author suggests that this behavior reassures swing voters, as it indicates that any extreme actions are provisional and that Trump is willing to retreat. The author notes that Trump's poll numbers have improved after he bobbed and wove away from his most extreme China tariffs, separated from Elon Musk, and complained about Vladimir Putin. The author argues that seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency. </p>
