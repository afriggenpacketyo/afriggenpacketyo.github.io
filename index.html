          <p>Australia's economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 remained unchanged at 1.3% year-on-year, failing to meet the estimated 1.5% growth. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the slow growth to reduced public spending, weak consumer demand, and decreased exports. Extreme weather events, such as mining disruptions, tourism declines, and shipping delays, also contributed to the economic slowdown. The Reserve Bank of Australia previously lowered interest rates to a two-year low in May, and anticipates a gradual recovery in consumption and public demand during 2025, but the recovery may be slower than initially expected due to global uncertainties.

          <p>Boulder, Colorado, has experienced heightened tensions within its city council as activists have consistently disrupted meetings. These disruptions are aimed at pressuring the city council to issue a call for a cease-fire in Gaza. The unusual level of tension suggests a shift in the political landscape of Boulder.

          <p>Despite the common narrative that China has stolen millions of American jobs, particularly in manufacturing, an opposing viewpoint suggests that the "China shock" was beneficial for America. While acknowledging that some sectors experienced layoffs and regional manufacturing declined, the article argues that cheap Chinese goods have made life more affordable for the average American. The piece challenges the research from economists like David Autor, who claim the "China shock" harmed the U.S. labor market, suggesting a more nuanced perspective on the economic impact of trade with China. This challenges the anti-China sentiment often voiced by politicians and voters.</p>

          <p>Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant initially accused of writing letters threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump, was framed, according to investigators. Prosecutors now claim that Demetric Deshawn Scott, who is set to face trial for assaulting and robbing Morales-Reyes, wrote the letters to prevent him from testifying in the robbery case. Scott has been charged with witness intimidation, identity theft, and breach of bail, admitting that his intention was to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying rather than to threaten the president. The Department of Homeland Security had previously announced Morales-Reyes's arrest and published a copy of the threatening letter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that used a federal law to require hospitals to perform abortions in emergency situations. The previous guidance, issued after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, stated that under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), doctors must perform abortions in emergency departments if it serves as a stabilizing medical treatment. The HHS and CMS rescinded the guidance, stating that they "do not reflect the policy of this Administration". Abortion rights groups criticized the administration, while previous legal challenges had already questioned the guidance's validity.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration eases EPA regulations, Houston could face significant environmental consequences due to increased pollution. The EPA has been reducing and reconsidering rules designed to combat pollution, while also reducing the number of enforcement staff. This could lead to higher risks of lung disease, asthma, and heart attacks for residents near facilities like the NRG Energy coal-fired power plant. A study indicated that pollution from this plant contributes to premature deaths, and exemptions from federal regulations intended to lower mercury emissions have been granted to numerous plants, many located near low-income, minority communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is facing criticism for potentially undermining the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill could cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage and make it harder to sign up for health plans on ACA marketplaces. Critics argue it is a veiled attempt to repeal parts of Obamacare, while Republicans claim it aims to reduce waste and fraud in government health programs. The bill includes provisions that would affect Medicaid and ACA enrollees, leaving millions more without health insurance by 2034. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Everest ascent by British climbers using xenon gas to accelerate acclimatization has sparked controversy.

This incident mirrors historical debates over using supplemental oxygen and other aids in mountaineering, raising questions about the ethics of innovation in sports.</p>

Senator Jeanne Shaheen spoke with the TSA about her husband, William Shaheen, who was then removed from the "Quiet Skies" list and placed on a "secure flight exclusion list," exempting him from future screening. The initial flagging occurred due to his travel companion being listed as a "known or suspected terrorist" by the FBI. The senator said she was unaware of her husband's monitoring or preferential treatment, and he has since been removed from the exclusion list.</p>
