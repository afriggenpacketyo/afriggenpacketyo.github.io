        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With record heat impacting global infrastructure, roads, rails, and bridges face significant challenges such as melting asphalt, buckling tracks, and expanding bridge joints. Experts suggest solutions like heat-reflective coatings for roads, using tree-based resins for pavements, and replacing timber sleepers with reinforced concrete on railways. Bridges can be climate-proofed with bearings that absorb larger movements and regular inspections after extreme temperature events. These adaptations are crucial to maintaining safe and efficient transportation systems in a warming world. Optimism is tempered by the scale of the challenge, but these measures offer a path forward. </p>

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes that the reconciliation of Musk and Trump would be a positive development for Tesla, given their mutual needs. The recent verbal exchanges between Musk and Trump stemmed from Musk's departure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenyan President William Ruto's ambitious National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (NYOTA) program, aimed at creating 800,000 jobs for young Kenyans, faces skepticism from Gen Z due to budget constraints and past unfulfilled promises. Many young Kenyans view the initiative as political posturing, citing a lack of trust in the president's commitments. Experts also question the plan's financial foundation, pointing to a lack of clarity in the budget and concerns about the sustainability of the proposed wages. This skepticism arises after youth-led demonstrations demanding better governance and policy reversals, reflecting a strained relationship between the government and digitally mobilized youth. </p>

          <p>Ketamine, used both as an anesthetic and a hallucinogen, is gaining popularity for treating depression, with clinics administering the drug becoming more common. However, recreational use outside of medical supervision is also increasing, posing risks of physical and mental health consequences. Studies show a significant rise in ketamine use, particularly among white people and those with college degrees, often in combination with other recreational drugs. Experts emphasize the importance of medical supervision to mitigate risks and prevent abuse, as ketamine can be addictive and lead to serious health problems when misused. </p>

          <p>The UN human rights chief has urged the United States to retract sanctions imposed on four judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC), calling the measures deeply disturbing. The sanctions were enacted in response to the ICC's investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan and its issuing of arrest warrants for top Israeli officials. The UN's Volker Türk emphasized that attacks against judges undermine the rule of law, while the ICC stated it deplores the sanctions as a clear attempt to undermine its independence.

          <p>Archeologists have uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds used for growing crops by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The scale of the agriculture is surprising given the relatively poor growing conditions and the presence of wild rice nearby. The discovery highlights the extensive farming practices of Native Americans before European colonization and offers insights into their agricultural systems. </p>
