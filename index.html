          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, have left Paul Weiss after the firm made a deal with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The agreement involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono services agreed upon by both the firm and the Trump administration. The departures follow earlier controversies, including an executive order targeting Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who investigated Trump. The legal community has been divided over such deals, with some firms opting to sue the administration instead. </p>
