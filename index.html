          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the nation‚Äôs top health official, has declared autism an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù and launched a federal effort to find environmental toxins as the cause, arguing that genetic research is a ‚Äúdead end.‚Äù Autism scientists, however, disagree with this approach, citing hundreds of genes associated with autism and arguing that genetics are the primary driver. Researchers fear that Kennedy‚Äôs focus on environmental toxins could distract from genetic research, which has facilitated the development of new therapies for those with profound autism. Kennedy's pledge to find a silver-bullet answer is a false promise that could cause more anxiety for families. </p>

          <p>Milwaukee is currently grappling with a lead poisoning crisis in its schools, leading to temporary closures and inspections. The city's health officials initially collaborated with the CDC for support, but the Trump administration denied further federal assistance due to restructuring within the Department of Health and Human Services. This restructuring resulted in the layoff of the CDC's lead exposure team, leaving Milwaukee to manage the crisis independently. The city has replaced thousands of lead water service lines but requires additional funding to complete the project, highlighting the challenges local governments face when federal support is lacking.</p>

          <p>Popular Mexican band Grupo Firme canceled a performance in California after the Trump administration suspended their visas. This action follows a series of moves targeting Mexican artists whose music allegedly glorifies cartel violence. The U.S. State Department has been revoking visas of musicians who play "narco-corridos," a genre that sometimes portrays cartel leaders as heroic figures. Grupo Firme had recently taken steps to distance itself from this aspect of the genre, announcing that it would no longer sing such music in concerts, as Mexican musicians have previously been targeted by criminal groups.</p>

          <p>The World Food Programme (WFP) reported that crowds of civilians rushed aid trucks in Gaza, as hunger and desperation create chaotic scenes, with 77 trucks loaded with flour being stopped and looted. WFP stated that after nearly 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving and unwilling to watch food pass them by. A UN-backed assessment indicates Gaza's entire population is at "critical risk" of famine, with two million people in desperate need of food. The UN Palestinian relief agency chief said the aid sent in the past week was just over 10% of people's daily needs, while Israel accuses the UN of not distributing aid already inside Gaza.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are often used to convey pithy meaning, but studies show that using jargon impedes trust. Gen Zers are especially vulnerable, as they may lean into buzzwords and cling to them like corporate life rafts. Employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, and new words buzz all the time. The author suspects buzzwords are really about people using poetry to distract from the fact that all they're doing is trying to make money, because that's all most buzzwords are ‚Äî metaphors.</p>

Nvidia's strong earnings report and guidance boosted its stock, while Salesforce faced concerns over its focus on AI. The Federal Reserve's cautious approach to monetary policy, as indicated in its May meeting minutes, added to market uncertainty. The S&P 500 gained nearly 2% during the holiday-shortened week and jumped more than 6% in May, but tariffs and inflation remain key factors impacting market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 130 former state and federal judges are urging the government to drop its charges against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, calling her indictment an ‚Äúegregious overreach‚Äù by the executive branch. Dugan was indicted after being accused of helping an undocumented migrant flee arrest at her courthouse, facing federal charges of obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual. The former judges filed an amicus brief, arguing that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts and that the indictment threatens judicial independence. The state's supreme court suspended her from the bench days after her initial court appearance.</p>

          <p>The European Union criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports, warning that it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson said that the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase. The United Steelworkers union (USW) also criticized Trump's announcement and said it is a direct attack on Canadian industries and workers. Trump announced that he planned on doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, increasing the pressure on manufacturers dependent on industrial metals for production.</p>

Several escapees relied on internet phone services to communicate with accomplices, and authorities are appealing to the public for help in locating the remaining fugitives. The facility where the men were held is overcrowded because of slow-moving criminal cases in the district's court system, and one-third of the security cameras at the jail were not working at the time of the escape.</p>
