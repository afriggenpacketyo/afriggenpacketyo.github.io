          <p>A pro-Israel hacking group, Gonjeshke Darande, has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex, resulting in the theft of over $90 million. The hackers drained funds from platform wallets and posted anti-government messages referencing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This attack follows escalating tensions and missile exchanges between Israel and Iran. The hacking group also claimed responsibility for a separate cyberattack on Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah earlier in the week, highlighting the growing cyber warfare component of the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Iranian officials have traded heated remarks as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. Trump has demanded an unconditional surrender from Iran, while Iranian officials have rejected the demand and threatened retaliation. The Iranian mission to the UN responded to Trump's remarks with a post stating that no Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House. The post further condemned Trump's threat to target Iran's Supreme Leader and emphasized that Iran does not negotiate under duress and will respond to any threat with a counter-threat.

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law that restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a decision likely to impact similar laws in other states. The court ruled 6-3 to reject a challenge arguing that the law violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. The Tennessee law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under 18. The dissenting justices argued that the law discriminates based on sex and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding sex classifications.</p>

          <p>The US military has moved at least 30 tanker aircraft from bases in America to Europe, according to flight tracking data, amid ongoing strikes between Israel and Iran. These tanker aircraft are used to refuel fighter jets and bombers, with some stopping at US airbases in Spain, Scotland, and England. While the connection to the conflict is unconfirmed, an expert suggests the deployments indicate contingency plans to support intensive combat operations in the region. The movements coincide with reports of the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier being moved from the South China Sea towards the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A new study in Nature warns that climate change will significantly reduce global food production by the end of the century, even with adaptation efforts. Key staple crops are projected to decline by 11.2% compared to a world without warming, with the largest drops occurring in major food-producing regions like the US Midwest. Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, are already impacting harvests, and rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are expected to diminish yields further. The study highlights the potential for increased food insecurity as the global population continues to rise.</p>

          <h2>HS2 Rail Line Faces Further Delays with No New Completion Date</h2>

          <p>The opening of the HS2 high-speed railway line in the UK will be delayed beyond the target date of 2033, with the government unable to provide a new timeline for completion. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the project as an "appalling mess" and cited missed deadlines and rising costs, which have increased by £37bn since the project was approved in 2012. An interim report attributed the delays and cost overruns to mismanagement, unstable designs, and a lack of timely intervention to address known challenges. A second report will review the governance and accountability of HS2 Ltd.</p>
