          <p>Australia has expelled Iran's ambassador and three other officials, citing intelligence that links the Iranian government to antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared these incidents, including an arson attack on a synagogue and a cafe, as dangerous acts of aggression intended to undermine social cohesion within the community. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) assessed that Iran used criminal proxies to conceal its involvement. This significant diplomatic action marks Australia's first ambassador expulsion since World War Two, accompanied by the suspension of its Tehran embassy operations and the planned designation of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>French stock markets experienced a significant downturn, with the CAC 40 index plummeting over 2% following political developments that threaten the government's stability. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has called for a confidence vote on his budget plans for September 8, which the country's three main opposition parties have refused to support. This situation raises the prospect of a government collapse, contributing to broader European market anxieties. The article highlights that this political uncertainty in France, coupled with global investor concerns over US President Donald Trump's actions regarding the Federal Reserve, is impacting market performance. Investors are closely watching for further political and economic indicators.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud, a move she has vowed to challenge legally. Cook, the first Black woman appointed to the Fed board, stated Trump lacks the authority to remove her and will not resign, setting the stage for a potential legal dispute over presidential authority. This action follows months of Trump's public criticism against the Federal Reserve and its Chair, Jerome Powell, regarding interest rate policies and the central bank's independence. The article highlights that replacing Cook could shift the board's balance, potentially giving Trump appointees a majority and raising concerns about political influence on monetary policy.</p>

          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its national carbon market to include major polluting industries by 2027, a move three years ahead of its original schedule. New guidelines from top policymakers also introduce absolute limits on emissions, representing a tougher standard compared to the current intensity-based caps. This initiative highlights China's commitment to achieving its climate targets and is anticipated to invigorate the country's carbon market. The article notes that the steel, aluminum, and cement sectors will be the first new additions this year, aiming to address China's status as the world's largest carbon polluter stemming from its rapid economic development.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has described illegal immigration as a "scourge" affecting Britain on an unprecedented scale, outlining his party's stringent plans to tackle small boat crossings. These proposals include the detention and deportation of illegal entrants, alongside significant legal changes such as withdrawing from the European Court of Human Rights and repealing the Human Rights Act.

          <p>President Trump is engaged in several high-profile political battles, including public attacks against former allies John Bolton and Chris Christie, and a threat to withhold federal funds from Maryland. The article suggests Trump views these actions as "payback" for perceived "lawfare" against him during his previous term, including a recently overturned civil fraud judgment. He questioned Christie's past conduct regarding "Bridgegate" and criticized Bolton's comments on the Russia-Ukraine war. Furthermore, Trump publicly suggested he might "rethink" federal funding for Maryland's Francis Scott Key Bridge reconstruction due to a dispute with Governor Wes Moore, raising significant concerns about using government power for political retribution.</p>

          <p>Food price inflation in the UK has reached its highest point in 18 months, hitting 4.2% in the year to August, primarily driven by increasing costs of chocolate, butter, and eggs. The British Retail Consortium's monitor indicates overall shop prices are rising at the fastest rate since March last year. Poor cocoa harvests, attributed to climate change and crop disease, are specifically cited for the surge in chocolate prices, alongside high demand and increased labor costs for staples like butter and eggs. This persistent rise in food costs is adding to broader inflationary pressures, with official figures showing UK inflation at 3.8% in July, compelling consumers to reassess their household budgets.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim a significant breakthrough in invisibility technology for Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft, making their signals exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. Traditionally, AEW&C aircraft are vulnerable due to their powerful radar emissions, which make them visible from hundreds of kilometers away. The new method, based on frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, rendering the signal chaotic and obscuring its directional origin from adversaries. This innovation is described as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the stealth and survivability of these critical command nodes in military operations.</p>

          <p>Current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials have warned Congress that the Trump administration's sweeping changes and budget cuts risk undoing reforms made since Hurricane Katrina. An open letter, the "Katrina Declaration," alleges that Trump's FEMA picks lack qualifications and that staff cuts hinder the agency's mission. It criticizes the termination of grants for state and local disaster preparedness, such as the BRIC program, which a federal judge recently blocked. The administration defends its actions as necessary reforms to combat inefficiency, but the article highlights deep concerns within FEMA about its capacity to respond effectively to future national catastrophes and protect the American people.</p>

          <p>A district court judge has ruled Utah's current congressional map unlawful, mandating its redrawing for the 2026 midterm elections. The Republican-controlled legislature drew the 2021 map, which divided Salt Lake County—the state’s population center and a Democratic stronghold—among four districts, all subsequently electing Republicans by wide margins. Judge Dianna Gibson declared the map illegal because it circumvented a voter-established independent redistricting commission. This ruling creates uncertainty for the GOP, who are preparing to defend a slim House majority nationally. While appeals are expected, new maps must be drawn swiftly, potentially impacting the balance of power in the US House.</p>
