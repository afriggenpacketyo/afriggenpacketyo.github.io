          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 20:42:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's legal team argues her prosecution was barred by a non-prosecution agreement Epstein made in 2007, but the DOJ contends this agreement was limited to Florida and did not apply to her case in New York. The government's brief asserts that Maxwell was, at best, an incidental beneficiary of the deal and that federal prosecutors in Florida lacked the authority to bind other districts. Maxwell's attorneys maintain the government broke its promise, while victims' advocates insist she must remain imprisoned for her crimes.</p>

          <p>A recent series of firings at the Department of Justice has impacted the prosecution of a Florida businessman accused of embezzling $100 million from funds for children with special needs. The lead prosecutor on the case, Michael Gordon, was among more than 20 DOJ employees dismissed, a move critics allege is political retribution for work on U.S. Capitol riot cases. The dismissal has raised concerns among victims and lawmakers that justice for the thousands affected by the alleged fraud could be delayed or jeopardized. The accused, Leo Govoni, allegedly used the organization's accounts as a "slush fund" for personal enrichment, including private jet travel and real estate purchases.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Administration Implements 17% Tariff on Fresh Tomatoes from Mexico</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 20:31:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, terminating a previous agreement that prevented such duties. The Commerce Department stated the move is intended to protect American farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and artificially low prices that have harmed the domestic industry. While U.S. growers, particularly in Florida, have praised the decision as a victory, critics and some business groups warn it could lead to higher consumer prices for tomatoes and salsa, and potentially risk jobs in related U.S. industries. The Mexican government has criticized the tariff as unfair, attributing the growth in exports to product quality rather than improper practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to suspend a temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge that places significant limits on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities in Los Angeles. The order, from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, requires ICE agents to have "reasonable suspicion" before detaining individuals and prohibits them from relying solely on factors like race or language. The administration argues the injunction unlawfully restricts federal immigration enforcement and was granted after an unfairly rushed process. The lawsuit, supported by local governments and rights groups, alleges that ICE has engaged in unconstitutional practices, including indiscriminate arrests, to meet aggressive enforcement quotas.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million people across the U.S. Northeast are under flood watches as slow-moving storms bring intense rainfall to the region. Flash flood warnings have been issued for major metropolitan areas including New York City and Washington, D.C., with rainfall rates reaching up to four inches per hour in some locations. New Jersey's governor has declared a state of emergency due to the severe conditions, which have already caused widespread flooding and stranded vehicles in parts of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

The National Drought Group is meeting to assess the situation, which is caused by extended periods of low rainfall that impact water supplies, agriculture, and the environment. Yorkshire and the North West have already entered drought status, and the Environment Agency warns that five more regions in central and southern England could follow by September under a worst-case scenario. While climate change and water usage are increasing the risk of shortages, the declarations trigger water companies' management plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts assisted-living facility where a fire killed nine people was scheduled for a compliance review and recertification later this year, according to state officials. An initial investigation suggests the fire was not intentionally set and may have been caused by an electrical or mechanical issue. The facility, Gabriel House, is classified as an assisted-living residence, which has different regulatory standards than a nursing home. A previous compliance review in October 2023 found the facility was not compliant with certain state regulations, primarily related to missing documentation, for which it was required to submit a correction plan before its certificate was renewed.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court's order, thereby allowing the mass layoff of nearly 1,400 Department of Education employees to proceed for now. The administration is pursuing a plan to dismantle the agency and transfer its functions to the states, which led to the reduction-in-force. A federal judge had previously blocked the firings, finding that the administration was likely acting unlawfully without congressional authorization. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court lifted that injunction while the case is appealed, with the court's liberal justices dissenting sharply and arguing the judiciary's role is to check such "lawlessness."</p>

The fires, which have burned nearly 20,000 acres, are raging in steep, remote, and extremely dry terrain with temperatures exceeding 110 degrees. The largest blaze, the Green fire in Shasta-Trinity National Forest, was sparked by lightning and remains only 5% contained, with over 1,400 personnel assigned to fight it.

While the surge provided a temporary boost, officials predict a significant drop in cargo volume in the coming months once the new tariffs are in place. Importers have noted the substantial financial burden of existing tariffs, with one business owner stating their costs on a single load have increased from around $2,000 to over $40,000.

          <p>Veteran center Brook Lopez expressed his excitement about joining the Los Angeles Clippers, citing the team's winning culture and talented roster as key factors in his decision. The Southern California native, who signed a two-year, $18 million deal, is looking forward to playing alongside stars like Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, as well as his former Lakers teammate Ivica Zubac. Lopez, who has been a starter for most of his career, indicated his willingness to accept any role, including coming off the bench. He also suggested the possibility of playing alongside the 7-foot Zubac, creating a formidable "twin towers" lineup that could dominate defensively and complement each other on offense.</p>

          <p>A transgender woman, Cayla Calhoun, was violently assaulted in Washington, D.C., after moving there from Alabama in search of a safer environment. Calhoun was attacked by three men on scooters who shouted anti-trans slurs before beating her unconscious, leaving her with devastating injuries including a fractured vertebra, shattered elbow, and multiple facial fractures. The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the attack as a potential hate crime. A friend has launched a GoFundMe to support her recovery, and Calhoun, while facing a long and arduous healing process, is speaking out, linking the attack to the current political climate and the "sleight-of-hand disinformation" targeting transgender people.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, in his new role as the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has drawn widespread criticism for his advice to people at risk of losing their health coverage. During a Fox Business interview discussing a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid, Oz suggested that Americans should do their part to stay healthy to live up to their "God-given potential." He then offered a specific, and widely mocked, piece of advice: "don’t eat carrot cake. Eat real food," while simultaneously presenting the host with a carrot cake. His comments were perceived as out-of-touch and trivializing the serious issue of millions losing access to affordable health care.</p>

          <p>The West Indies cricket team suffered a crushing defeat against Australia, being bowled out for just 27 runs, the second-lowest score in Test cricket history. The historic collapse secured a 176-run victory and a 3-0 series sweep for Australia in the day-night Test in Jamaica. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking six wickets for nine runs, including five wickets in just 15 balls, the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history. The devastating performance left the West Indies captain describing the team's batting display as "heartbreaking" and "disappointing," as they needed 204 runs for a victory that seemed attainable.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Major League Baseball is missing a crucial opportunity by not having its biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, participate in the Home Run Derby. With both players opting out, the event lacks its main drawing power, diminishing its cultural relevance. The author suggests the league should be flexible and even let the players dictate the rules to encourage their participation, such as limiting the number of swings to reduce physical strain, a concern Ohtani has cited. The piece contends that having Ohtani and Judge compete would not only boost viewership but also elevate the profiles of other talented players in the contest, benefiting the sport as a whole.</p>

Glass House has denied ever employing minors, but the state has affirmed that employing individuals under 21 in the cannabis industry is strictly illegal and will not be tolerated.</p>

Cramer believes that a more M&A-friendly Federal Trade Commission under the Trump administration is encouraging these transactions.

The decision affects over 7,000 Syrians who were left in limbo, unable to work or secure permanent housing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia is driven less by a strategic change and more by personal frustration and a sense of humiliation. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has made him look weak by repeatedly ignoring his pleas to end the war in Ukraine and escalating attacks instead. The president, who believed his personal relationship with Putin could secure a swift peace deal, has grown angry that his calls have been met with more missile strikes. This perceived defiance has reportedly pushed Trump to authorize new weapons for Ukraine and threaten tariffs, not from a newfound love for Kyiv, but from a desire to reassert his own strength.</p>

His unexpected selection to the National League team, after only a month in the majors, drew criticism from some who felt more veteran players were snubbed. The 23-year-old's inclusion was largely propelled by a recent, electrifying performance where he struck out 12 batters against the formidable Los Angeles Dodgers. While acknowledging the backlash, NL manager Dave Roberts defended the decision, stating the young flamethrower's presence brings excitement and attention to the game, a sentiment that solidified after Misiorowski proved he could dominate one of baseball's best lineups.</p>

The Shetland Islands Council is studying the feasibility of building tunnels to connect four outlying isles, including the UK's most northerly inhabited island, Unst. Proponents argue the tunnels would be "transformational," boosting the local economy, which includes a major fishing industry and the UK's only spaceport. The multi-million pound project would likely be funded through borrowing and paid back with tolls, a model that could provide a new transport solution for other Scottish islands.</p>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, including the possibility of transforming it into a mutual organization owned by its postmasters. The move is part of an effort to create a "fresh vision" and rebuild trust following the devastating Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce the number of branches, it is seeking a national debate on the Post Office's future structure and services, particularly its role in banking. A change in ownership is unlikely before 2030, pending the replacement of the Horizon system and recommendations from the public inquiry.</p>
