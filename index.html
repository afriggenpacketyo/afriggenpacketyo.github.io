          <h2>Trump's Criticism of Fed Chair Powell Causes Market Volatility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 03:40:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, blaming him for not lowering interest rates and potentially slowing the economy. This criticism, coupled with concerns over Trump's tariff plans, has contributed to significant market turmoil, including plunges in US stocks and the dollar. Investors are seeking safe-haven assets like gold, which hit a record high, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. Trump's repeated calls for Powell's firing, despite the Fed's traditional independence, have further unsettled markets. (not investment advice)</p>
