          <p>Japan's core consumer prices increased by 3.5% in April, the fastest pace in over two years, driven by reduced government utility subsidies and rising rice prices. The increase, excluding fresh food, exceeded expectations and remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Energy prices rose significantly, while food prices continued to contribute to overall price growth. Service prices saw a slight decrease due to state subsidies for high school fees. The United States began imposing steep tariffs on Japanese automobiles and other products in April, but its impact on the economy and prices has so far been limited.</p>

          <p>The United States will impose new sanctions on Sudan after determining that the country used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). US exports to Sudan will be restricted and financial borrowing limits will be put in place starting June 6. The Sudanese military and the RSF have been accused of war crimes during the conflict. The US has called on the government of Sudan to cease all chemical weapons use and uphold its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>

          <p>North Korea's newest warship was severely damaged during a launch ceremony witnessed by Kim Jong Un, who expressed fury and vowed to punish those responsible. A malfunction in the launch mechanism caused the stern of the destroyer to slide prematurely into the water, crushing parts of the hull. Kim called the failure a criminal act and blamed it on carelessness. Naval analysts suggest the damage could be catastrophic, potentially warping the hull and inducing cracks. The incident marks a setback for North Korea's naval modernization efforts.</p>
