            <p>American tourists in Paris are experiencing a sense of shame and embarrassment due to President Trump's trade policies, with some taking measures to conceal their nationality. Travel guides about the U.S. have seen a significant drop in orders, while interest in destinations like Canada has increased. Oxford Economics forecasts a decrease in French tourists visiting the U.S. this year. While some Americans abroad support Trump's actions, others acknowledge the strained transatlantic relations and the negative perception of America under his leadership.</p>

            <p>Gordon Brown argues that the existing global order is under assault, marked by economic volatility, escalating conflicts, and the rejection of free trade and international cooperation. He asserts that the 2020s risk becoming a "devil's decade" defined by global poverty, dismembered nations, and a shift towards a power-based world order. Brown calls for a new global charter based on principles of cooperation, fair burden-sharing, and addressing the failures of hyper-globalization. He suggests building a coalition of willing nations to tackle global security, climate, health, and trade challenges, aiming to create a more stable and sustainable world order.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK government is contemplating nationalizing British Steel to prevent the collapse of the company after failed negotiations with its Chinese owners, Jingye. The government is changing the law to allow intervention, including buying coal to keep the furnaces burning, but the long-term costs and challenges are substantial. Nationalization is being considered as a way to preserve the UK's steel industry, ensure infrastructure development, and protect jobs, especially given the increasing view that governments need to be more active in safeguarding national interests. The decision reflects a shift away from neoliberalism towards greater state intervention in key industries.</p>

            <p>California is refusing to comply with a Trump administration order to certify that all school districts have eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The California Department of Education defended the legality of DEI efforts and stated that the federal request was vague. This defiance could lead to the loss of billions of dollars in federal education funding, but California argues that it is already complying with federal law through existing monitoring mechanisms. The decision aligns with other states that have also refused to comply with the order, citing concerns about the legality and scope of the demand.</p>

            <p>Following a long weekend, stock markets in Hong Kong and mainland China experienced volatility due to the ongoing trade war. A few niche healthcare companies involved in processing human blood plasma saw gains after Beijing announced reciprocal tariffs on US goods. These tariffs are expected to boost the market shares of domestic manufacturers, as foreign exporters of albumin face increased costs. The US is a major exporter of pharmaceutical products and medical devices to China, making the biotech sector a key area of impact in the trade war.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to block their access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. The firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in a successful defamation case against Fox News, alleges that the order is retaliatory and unconstitutional. Susman Godfrey argues that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies. The lawsuit claims that the executive order is an abuse of power and threatens the integrity of the legal system.</p>

The company reported a momentary surge of electrical current on four of its lines near the fire's origin and is exploring the possibility of induction, where a nearby active line induces an electric current in the unconnected line.</p>
