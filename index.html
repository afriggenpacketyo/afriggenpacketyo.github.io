          <p>A 9-year-old child passed away after an incident at The Boardwalk water park located in Hersheypark, Pennsylvania. The event occurred in the wave pool, prompting an immediate response from numerous trained lifeguards who performed life-saving measures before the child was transported to a medical center. The park's CEO expressed deep condolences to the family and has initiated a thorough internal review in cooperation with authorities to understand the circumstances. The wave pool was closed the following day out of respect for the victim and the staff involved in the rescue attempt.</p>

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed overnight in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, with many of the victims shot while waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. This incident occurs as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas appear to have stalled, exacerbating the dire humanitarian crisis where famine is a growing threat. The United Nations and various aid organizations continue to report severe difficulties in distributing aid due to Israeli military restrictions and security issues. International pressure is mounting on Israel to alleviate the suffering and ensure the safe delivery of essential supplies to the civilian population.</p>

          <p>Overnight aerial assaults between Russia and Ukraine resulted in the deaths of at least four people, with two fatalities reported in each country. In Ukraine, the Dnipro and Sumy regions were targeted by rockets and drones, causing casualties and significant damage to residential buildings and infrastructure, including a shopping center. Concurrently, Ukrainian drones targeted multiple regions within Russia, killing two in the Rostov region and hitting industrial facilities elsewhere. Both sides reported downing numerous drones and missiles, but the continued strikes highlight the escalating nature of the long-range conflict impacting civilian areas.</p>

          <p>Violent border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have entered a third day, resulting in at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people from both nations. The conflict, which reignited after a land mine incident, has expanded, with both countries trading accusations of initiating fresh artillery and gunfire attacks. International bodies, including ASEAN and the U.N. Security Council, are urging for a ceasefire and peaceful mediation to de-escalate the long-standing border dispute. Human Rights Watch has also raised concerns over the use of cluster munitions and the impact on civilians, calling for adherence to international humanitarian law.</p>

          <p>In a closely watched recall vote in Taiwan, all targeted lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang party, accused of being overly aligned with China, have successfully retained their seats. The "Great Recall" was initiated by a civic movement following legislative actions that were seen as attempts to obstruct the ruling Democratic Progressive Party government. Despite large-scale mobilization by pro-recall activists, the results mean the opposition will maintain its majority in the legislature, at least until another round of recall votes in August. The outcome is expected to intensify political polarization on the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own territory.</p>

          <p>An American comedian residing in Scotland shares her perspective on Donald Trump's visit, expressing a sense of personal intrusion and annoyance. She reflects on why she avoids discussing Trump in her comedy, noting his desperate need for Scottish acceptance despite a disconnect from the local culture. The author contrasts Trump's approach with her own love for Scotland and her experience assimilating into the culture. She pays homage to the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley's defiant protest against a previous Trump visit, suggesting that true Scottish identity is something Trump cannot grasp, despite his maternal heritage and ownership of golf resorts in the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Columbia University's recent agreement with the Trump administration represents a concerning capitulation that undermines academic independence in the United States. To restore its federal research funding, the university reportedly agreed to a $200 million fine and concessions including allowing a Trump-approved monitor to review admissions and oversee its Middle Eastern studies department. The author contends this deal, born from pressure over campus protests, sets a dangerous precedent of government extortion and control over private educational institutions.

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has ignited questions about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While some view the cancellation as a financial move by parent company Paramount amidst declining ad revenue and high production costs, others speculate about political motivations. The article notes the financial pressures on the industry, with shows like Colbert's and "Jimmy Kimmel Live" reportedly losing tens of millions annually. The future of other programs, particularly Jimmy Kimmel's, is now under scrutiny as the media landscape continues to be reshaped by streaming and shifting viewer habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is planning to spend over $230 million on seismic upgrades for the Gas Company Tower, a downtown skyscraper it purchased for $200 million last year. The total cost of the purchase and the "voluntary" retrofitting now exceeds the initial bargain price. County officials state the work is a proactive measure to ensure long-term safety and is still far cheaper than the estimated $1 billion needed to retrofit the current, seismically vulnerable Hall of Administration. However, the supervisor who opposed the purchase has called the escalating costs a "boondoggle" sold to the public without full transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals a significant increase in advanced liver disease among heavy drinkers in the U.S. over the past two decades, even though overall alcohol consumption patterns have not changed significantly. The research found that the prevalence of serious liver scarring more than doubled among heavy drinkers, with a particularly sharp rise among women, older individuals, and those with metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes. Researchers suggest that the changing health profile of the American drinker is a key factor. They warn that the U.S. definition of "heavy drinking" may be too lenient compared to evolving global health standards.</p>

          <p>This opinion column criticizes the Department of Homeland Security for posting the 19th-century painting "American Progress" on its social media, arguing it promotes a racist and exclusionary vision of America. The painting is a famous allegory for Manifest Destiny, the belief that the U.S. had a God-given right to expand westward, displacing Native Americans and others. The author argues that by captioning the image "A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending," the Trump administration is openly aligning with white supremacist ideologies and the "Heritage American" movement. This messaging is seen as a deliberate strategy to reveal the administration's racist id.</p>

          <p>A large-scale immigration raid by federal agents on Glass House Brands, one of California's largest licensed cannabis operators, has sent shockwaves through the state's legal cannabis industry. The raid, which resulted in the detention of hundreds and the death of a worker who fell while fleeing, has raised fears of a federal crackdown on an industry that is legal under state law but not federal law. The incident highlights the precarious position of cannabis businesses and their workforce, many of whom are undocumented. It also raises questions about labor practices within the industry, even at prominent, publicly-traded companies.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst," an analysis of recent ICE data reveals that the majority of immigrants arrested in the Los Angeles area have no criminal convictions. In June, nearly 70% of those arrested in the region had no criminal record, a sharp increase from previous months. This trend coincides with a push for more aggressive tactics and higher arrest quotas. Critics and immigration advocates argue the administration is being dishonest about its targets, sweeping up ordinary members of the community to meet deportation goals while publicly highlighting a minority of violent criminal cases.</p>

          <p>Recent quarterly earnings reports from major U.S. corporations paint a picture of an economy with divergent experiences under President Trump's tariff policies. While some sectors, particularly automakers and consumer-facing businesses, report significant financial pain and costs exceeding a billion dollars, many tech and financial firms are thriving. This split reality shows that companies less reliant on physical imports are insulated from the direct impact of the trade taxes. Despite the uncertainty and the mixed results, overall investor sentiment appears positive, with major stock indices reaching record highs, though the full impact on consumers remains to be seen.

          <p>This article presents IonQ as a compelling but high-risk investment in the emerging field of quantum computing. The company's unique "trapped ion" approach, which operates at room temperature, offers a potential cost and accuracy advantage over competitors using more common superconducting methods. While the quantum computing market is projected to be worth tens of billions by 2035, the technology is still developing, with widespread commercial viability not expected until around 2030. The article suggests that IonQ is a pure-play stock with massive upside if its technology succeeds, but also carries the risk of becoming worthless if it fails. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Cuban woman, who had legally entered the U.S. and was pursuing an asylum claim, was apprehended by masked federal agents immediately after a positive court hearing in El Paso, Texas. The judge had scheduled her next hearing for 2026, but as she left the courtroom, she was detained by ICE. This incident is part of a broader pattern of arrests at immigration courthouses, where attendees, even those with ongoing legal cases, are being detained. Advocates report that these tactics are creating widespread fear and are part of a push to increase deportations, often by reprocessing migrants through a fast-tracked system with less due process.</p>

Meanwhile, high mortgage rates and record prices are shutting out many first-time and middle-income buyers. Although inventory has increased, it remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the lock-in effect of low-rate mortgages continues to limit the number of homes for sale. (not investment advice)</p>

The situation is complicated by Turkey, which views the SDF as a threat and has warned against any moves toward autonomy.

While the Prime Minister called the humanitarian catastrophe unacceptable, some critics described the airdrops as "largely symbolic" and insufficient to address the man-made famine, calling instead for Israel to open all border crossings for aid to enter by land.</p>
