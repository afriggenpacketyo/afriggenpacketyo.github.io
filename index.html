          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded a significant visit to South Africa, signaling improved relations amidst strained ties with the United States under President Trump. The visit, Zelenskyy's first to Africa since 2019, underscores Ukraine's efforts to counter Russia's influence on the continent, especially after many African nations hesitated to condemn Russia's 2022 invasion. Amidst this diplomatic push, Russia disrupted Zelenskyy's visit with an airstrike on Kyiv, forcing him to cut his trip short, and South Africa's President Ramaphosa emphasized reaffirmed bonds between the two nations, highlighting the shifting dynamics of international relations and the search for new allies.

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is considering plans to introduce regional energy pricing, potentially offering discounts to homes near energy infrastructure, though he dismissed reports of imminent implementation as "nonsense." The government is exploring options for major reform in the electricity market, which could involve zonal pricing and reformed national pricing. While some energy businesses support the scheme for its potential to improve efficiency, others express concerns that it could lead to higher bills for millions of Britons. Optimism Score: 60</p>
