          <p>Amid a government shutdown, the Trump administration has halted $2.1 billion in federal funding for two significant Chicago infrastructure projects: the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project. The announcement was made by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who justified the hold by stating a need to prevent funds from being used for "race-based contracting." This move is part of a broader pattern of the administration targeting funding in Democrat-led cities and states during the shutdown, following similar freezes on major projects in New York and climate-related initiatives across 16 states.

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus, Hillsboro police identified a maroon minivan as the primary crime scene. The suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, allegedly used the "burner car" to abduct and kill Fandrich before abandoning it. After a frantic search, detectives traced the minivan to a scrapyard, but arrived too late, discovering it had been crushed just a week prior. The loss of this crucial piece of forensic evidence presented a significant challenge for prosecutors in the case against Milner, who was Fandrich's wife's former lover.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, Democrats are publicly blaming Republicans for the potential loss of health insurance for millions, an issue tied to the expiration of pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies. Democratic leaders argue that failing to extend these enhanced tax credits will cause significant premium hikes, while some Republicans counter that the subsidies are a fiscally irresponsible temporary fix that contributes to waste and fails to address root healthcare costs. The debate highlights a fundamental partisan divide on healthcare policy, with conservatives suggesting the issue can be negotiated after the government reopens since the subsidies do not expire until the end of the year.

          <p>China's Cyberspace Administration (CAC) has initiated a two-month "clean-up" campaign targeting online content that regulators believe fosters negative emotions among the public. The crackdown aims to curb behaviors such as "inciting extreme group antagonism," spreading pessimism about education or work, and "selling anxiety-inducing content." This move represents a notable shift in Beijing's internet censorship strategy, now focusing specifically on emotional sentiment and placing greater responsibility on social media platforms like Weibo to manage user-generated content and prevent the spread of dissent or widespread negativity.</p>

          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the property technology sector is emerging from a challenging three-year "winter," evidenced by successful IPOs and new unicorn companies. However, he notes that the climate-related property tech space is facing a negative sentiment shift, struggling due to political winds moving away from sustainability initiatives. Despite this, Wallace remains optimistic about long-term investment in decarbonizing real estate, citing that local governments are increasingly implementing carbon taxes to raise capital, which will drive demand for climate tech solutions regardless of national policy.

          <p>A new report from the EAT-Lancet Commission asserts that even with a full transition from fossil fuels, current food and farming practices will push global temperatures past the critical 1.5°C threshold. The research indicates that the most effective solution is for people in wealthier countries to adopt a more plant-based diet, significantly reducing red meat and dairy consumption. This dietary shift, combined with reducing food waste and improving agricultural productivity, could cut annual emissions from food systems by more than half. The report highlights a global dietary inequality, where the diets of the richest 30% of the population contribute to over 70% of food-related environmental pressures.</p>

          <p>The recent rollback of the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed packages under $800 to be imported tariff-free, will not apply to physical music formats like vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes. This is due to the Berman Amendment, a Cold War-era law that prevents presidents from regulating the flow of "informational materials." The exemption is a significant relief for the booming vinyl industry, which has seen a major resurgence driven by artists like Taylor Swift and younger consumers. While consumers and major labels benefit, some U.S.-based record manufacturers argue that tariffs would have supported domestic production and created more American jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new investigation by DW and De Groene Amsterdammer indicates that conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have likely entered the supply chain of Volkswagen's electric vehicles. The report identifies at least six smelters linked to conflict minerals, including some in China, Malaysia, and Rwanda, listed in VW's own raw materials report. These minerals, known as 3TG (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold), are crucial for EV production, but their trade in the DRC helps fund violent conflict.

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's approach to economic policy, particularly his pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, mirrors Richard Nixon's 1972 strategy to stimulate the economy ahead of an election.

While Trump's goal may be to secure short-term political gains, such as a favorable Congress in the midterms, this gambit risks long-term economic damage. Forcing the Fed to artificially boost the economy could unnerve financial markets and lead to stagflation, but the article suggests Trump may be willing to risk economic stability for political power.

          <p>China's extended "super golden week" holiday has started with a surge in domestic travel, signaling a positive sign for the country's efforts to boost consumer spending. On the first day of the holiday, the national railway system handled a record number of passengers, with several major stations like Guangzhou South also setting new single-day peaks. Other forms of travel, including waterway and air, also saw year-on-year increases. This robust start to the holiday period is a welcome development for Beijing as it seeks to stimulate its domestic economy and tourism sector.</p>

          <p>OnePay, the fintech company majority-owned by retail giant Walmart, is set to offer cryptocurrency trading and custody services on its mobile app later this year. According to sources, the platform will initially support Bitcoin and Ether, facilitated by the startup Zerohash. This move positions OnePay to compete with other major financial apps like PayPal and Cash App, which already offer crypto services. By integrating crypto, OnePay aims to enhance its "everything app" for digital finance, potentially allowing users to convert crypto to cash for in-store purchases, as it continues to build out its suite of banking and credit products.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent call by thousands in the film industry to boycott Israeli cinema is ill-conceived. The author contends that targeting the film industry, which often relies on state funding but operates with artistic independence, silences a vital source of internal dissent and critical commentary on Israeli society, including the occupation. Using the award-winning film 'The Sea' as an example, the piece highlights how Israeli cinema provides a platform for nuanced stories that challenge militarism and government policy. The author suggests that instead of boycotting, international artists should engage with and support Israeli filmmakers to help change public opinion from within.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's newly announced "TrumpRx" website and a voluntary deal with Pfizer to lower Medicaid drug prices are unlikely to significantly impact costs for most Americans, according to health policy experts. The TrumpRx site, which aims to offer discounted drugs for cash-paying customers, will compete with existing services like GoodRx and may not be beneficial for the majority of insured Americans. Furthermore, the details of the Pfizer deal are confidential, making it difficult to assess its actual savings, as Medicaid already receives substantial, federally mandated discounts. Critics suggest these moves are more about political messaging than substantive policy reform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that both Democrats and Republicans are responsible for the reckless accumulation of U.S. federal debt, which has increased by $2 trillion in the last year alone. The author criticizes Republicans for overseeing much of this surge while claiming to be fiscal hawks, noting that tariff revenues do little to alter the country's fiscal trajectory. Democrats are faulted for pushing for more permanent spending, such as expanding Obamacare subsidies, and using government shutdown threats as leverage. The piece concludes that neither party is addressing the root cause of the problem: the relentless and unchecked growth of entitlement and subsidy programs. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities stated that the attacker, Jihad Al Shamie, was not armed with a gun, and the only shots fired came from police. The victim's death is now being considered a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of the necessary police action to stop the vicious attack. Another person who was injured and is currently hospitalized also sustained a gunshot wound, with both individuals having been behind the synagogue doors during the incident.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. federal agencies are facing scrutiny for potentially violating the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits partisan political activity by federal employees. As the government shutdown continues, an increasing number of agencies have posted messages on websites and in automated emails that explicitly blame Democrats for the funding lapse. For example, the Treasury Department's website stated that the "radical left has chosen to shut down the... government." Legal experts and Democratic lawmakers have called these actions a "naked violation" of the law, which is designed to keep the federal workforce politically neutral.</p>

McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris finished fifth and sixth, respectively. While Alonso's pace was notable, it is not expected that Aston Martin will be a top contender for pole position, as the team was likely running a lighter fuel load or a higher engine mode. However, the performance suggests a potentially strong weekend for the team on a low-speed track that suits their car's high-downforce characteristics.</p>

The cubs were discovered packed in bags on a small boat, and five individuals were arrested. The rescued animals were taken to a center run by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), though two later died due to being in very poor condition. The incident highlights Somaliland's role as a major transit hub for the illegal pet trade, which is driving the endangered species toward extinction, with fewer than 7,000 cheetahs remaining in the wild.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is set to sentence music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. While the jury acquitted him of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, citing a history of violent behavior. Combs' defense has argued for a 14-month sentence, which would amount to time served, presenting letters of support and a letter from Combs himself apologizing for his actions. The sentencing will conclude a high-profile, two-month trial that featured testimony from dozens of witnesses, including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that mothers in England experience a substantial and prolonged reduction in their earnings after having children. The data shows that five years after the birth of their first child, mothers' monthly earnings are, on average, £1,051 lower than their salary from one year before the birth. This "motherhood penalty" is attributed to factors like taking extended parental leave, unaffordable childcare, and a lack of flexible work options. Campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed called the findings "abhorrent," highlighting how the financial impact contributes significantly to the overall gender pay gap.</p>
