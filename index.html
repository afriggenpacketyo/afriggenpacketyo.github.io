            <p>China's C909 passenger jet is increasing its presence in Southeast Asia, with VietJet being the third airline in the region to incorporate it into commercial operations. Two C909 jets, leased from Chengdu Airlines, will operate on domestic routes within Vietnam, connecting Hanoi to Con Dao Island and Con Dao Island to Ho Chi Minh City. This expansion follows regulatory reforms in Vietnam that allow airlines to import aircraft certified by Brazil, Canada, Russia, Britain, and China, broadening import options beyond the US and EU. The C909 has already carried over 250,000 passengers on 15 Southeast Asian routes through TransNusa and Lao Airlines.</p>

The statue will be accessible to the public until late January, including weekends and holidays, aiming to attract "anime pilgrims" to the city. This initiative follows similar campaigns by local railway companies, including Evangelion-themed trains and a 3.6-meter-tall "Spear of Longinus" installation at Tenryu Futamata Station, which served as a model for a location in the 2021 movie. The campaign also includes special railway passes and a stamp rally covering 21 locations.</p>

            <p>Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban is facing increasing scrutiny for dismantling democratic institutions and consolidating power. Critics argue that Orban's government has taken control of the media, civil society, and universities, following a model similar to Vladimir Putin's Russia. The EU has begun freezing funds to Hungary, but Orban and his allies have already gained control of much of the country's media landscape. Orban's actions are drawing comparisons to Trump's approach, raising concerns about the future of democracy in Hungary, especially regarding freedom of assembly and LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>While tongue-scraping is a common dental practice aimed at removing bacteria and freshening breath, some experts caution about potential heart health risks. The concern is that tongue-scraping can cause microscopic cuts on the tongue, potentially introducing bacteria into the bloodstream and increasing the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. Over-scraping can also lower nitric oxide levels, which are important for heart health, potentially leading to high blood pressure. Experts recommend maintaining overall oral hygiene through regular dental visits, brushing, and flossing, while viewing tongue-scraping as a less essential step.</p>

The act of breaking cascarones over each other's heads symbolizes love, care, and fun, creating a powerful connection to the past. Scholars note that cascarones have been part of Texan Easter celebrations since the state was part of Mexico, with the egg representing fertility and rebirth.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more direct approach in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, urging Kigali to cease its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw troops from the DRC. This shift reflects China's need to protect its significant mining interests in the region and maintain relationships with both countries. China voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role, departing from its usual policy of non-interference. Beijing's actions highlight its evolving strategy in Africa, balancing non-interference with safeguarding economic interests.</p>

The company will continue to deliver packages worth less than $800, which are subject to minimal checks.
