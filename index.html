          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 10:52:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded an executive order that extended U.S. Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris. While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection after leaving office, the Biden administration had previously extended Harris's detail due to the threat environment. However, a new directive, effective September 1, cancels this extension, with sources indicating a recent threat assessment found no specific information warranting continued protection. This decision is part of a broader pattern of the administration removing security details for former officials and political figures.</p>

          <p>A federal court hearing has commenced regarding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her. Cook's lawsuit argues that the president lacks the legal cause required to remove a Fed Board governor, challenging the basis of her termination which stems from allegations of mortgage fraud. President Trump's legal team contends that determining cause is at the president's discretion. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve, as it addresses the president's authority over its board members.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's continued support for issuing student visas to Chinese nationals is raising concerns among some policy experts about potential national security risks. Critics, such as Michael Sobolik from the Hudson Institute, argue that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has previously exploited this access for espionage and to exert influence on U.S. campuses. The administration maintains it is continuing existing policy and carefully vets all applicants, while the President has stated that a significant reduction in Chinese students would financially harm American universities. The debate highlights the tension between educational exchange, economic benefits, and national security.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced its decision to restore a large, controversial portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee to the library at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The painting, which includes a depiction of an enslaved man holding Lee's horse, was removed in 2022 under a law mandating the removal of Confederate tributes from military installations. This move aligns with the Trump administration's stance on preserving historical symbols, framing it as an effort to honor history rather than erase it. The decision has raised questions about its compliance with the 2020 legislation and has reignited debates over Confederate iconography.</p>

          <p>The ancient practice of yoga has become a significant instrument of India's soft power and cultural diplomacy on the global stage. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga has elevated the practice into a symbol of India's cultural identity and heritage. Through collaborations with international organizations like the WHO and various cultural exchanges, India promotes yoga not just for wellness but as a non-controversial tool to build people-to-people connections. However, the practice faces criticism in the West for over-commercialization and cultural appropriation, sometimes detaching it from its spiritual roots.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming only the 21st player to achieve this feat. In his final at-bat, he had a chance to become the first player ever to hit five, but he popped out against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the lopsided game. This outcome averted a potential controversy, as a record-breaking fifth home run against a non-pitcher might have been viewed as illegitimate by some. The event highlights the increasing and sometimes criticized practice of using position players to pitch in blowouts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from performing or counseling on abortions, with an exception only for saving the mother's life. This rule would reverse a 2022 Biden administration policy that allowed for abortions in cases of rape, incest, and endangerment to the mother's health. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from veterans and abortion rights advocates, who argue it will endanger women, particularly survivors of sexual assault, which is prevalent in the military. The VA characterized the move as a matter of patient safety and adherence to a 1992 law.</p>

          <p>President Trump has informed Congress that he will not spend $4.9 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved, utilizing a rare budgetary tool known as a pocket rescission. This maneuver involves the president requesting to withhold funds so close to the end of the fiscal year that Congress does not have the required 45 days to act, causing the funding to expire. The move, last used in 1977, effectively allows the administration to cut spending without legislative approval. The targeted funds were allocated for the State Department and USAID, aligning with the administration's broader policy of reducing foreign assistance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a proposed regulation to change how long visas are valid for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists. Currently, these visas are typically valid for the duration of a person's program or employment. The new rule would impose fixed time limits, such as four years for students and 240 days for journalists, who would then need to apply for extensions to continue their stay. The administration states this change is necessary for better monitoring and oversight, but it is seen by critics as part of a broader effort to tighten legal immigration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's dismissal of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez has drawn rare bipartisan condemnation from Congress. Monarez was reportedly fired by the health secretary for refusing to align with the administration's agenda, including its stance on vaccines, prompting her to legally challenge her removal. The turmoil at the agency also led to the resignation of four senior leaders and a staff walkout in protest. Republican senators like Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy have expressed alarm over the move, highlighting concerns about political interference in scientific processes and public health.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's AI Action Plan, combined with its efforts to restrict certain types of data collection and research, threatens to automate and deepen existing health inequities. The plan's vague guidance against "ideological bias" may pressure developers to use incomplete or skewed datasets, particularly concerning race and gender, which could encode biases into clinical AI tools for decades. This article argues that by purging data and pressuring government researchers, the administration is creating a foundation where AI systems will reflect and amplify current health disparities, similar to how flawed race-based adjustments have persisted in traditional medical tools.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD reported a nearly 30% drop in profits for the second quarter compared to the previous year, despite a significant surge in overseas sales. The decline is attributed to an intense price war and aggressive marketing within the highly competitive Chinese domestic market, which has squeezed profit margins. While the company's deliveries to foreign customers increased by almost 145% year-on-year, this growth was not enough to offset the adverse financial impact of the fierce competition at home. The results fell short of analyst expectations for both profit and revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent data shows that the median price for condominiums and co-ops in the U.S. has fallen by 2.1% over the past year, in contrast to a slight increase in single-family home prices. This price drop is largely attributed to an oversupply of condos on the market, particularly in states like Florida and Texas. However, real estate experts caution that lower sale prices do not necessarily make condos a bargain. Rising costs for HOA dues, insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements can significantly increase the total cost of ownership, sometimes making them as or more expensive than detached homes in the long run.

Her lawsuit describes the president's action as "unprecedented and illegal," arguing it is based on unsubstantiated allegations and lacks the required legal cause for removal. This case represents a significant test of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference, as Trump has been openly critical of the central bank's policies and seeks to install a majority on its board.
