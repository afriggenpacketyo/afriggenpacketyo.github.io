          <p>Chinese trend-toy maker Pop Mart is raising prices on its Labubu character toys, particularly in the US market, due to the character's growing international popularity and the impact of tariffs. The company is also shifting production to Vietnam to mitigate the effects of the US-China tariff war on its profit margins. The price of the new Labubu 3.0 collection will increase in the US from $22 to $28, while remaining at 99 yuan in mainland China, reflecting Pop Mart's strategy to position itself as a high-end brand targeting adult buyers overseas, allowing for greater pricing power.

          <p>The United States is strengthening its military presence in the "first island chain," a strategic line stretching from Okinawa to Taiwan and the Philippines, to deter China's military ambitions in the Pacific Ocean. The deployment of B-1B strategic bombers to Japan is a key component of this strategy, signaling US resolve to Beijing. This move comes amid concerns that the Trump administration may be reducing its commitment to Europe and NATO, making it crucial to reassure allies in the Indo-Pacific region of continued US support and deter any misinterpretations by China.</p>

The Bank of Korea had already warned of slower growth for 2025, and analysts anticipate further rate cuts in response to the economic slowdown.

Trump implied that the US might be willing to formally recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea as part of a deal to end the war in Ukraine. This stance contradicts Ukraine's long-held position that it will not cede Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. The US administration has yet to publicly offer specifics about what geographic concessions would have to be made.</p>

          <p>More than six million illegal vaping products have been seized by Trading Standards officers across England in the past three years, as authorities prepare for a ban on single-use disposable vapes. These illicit vapes often contain larger tank sizes, higher nicotine strengths, and lack proper labeling, posing health risks to consumers. Trading Standards officers have uncovered sophisticated networks involved in the distribution of these products, which are also linked to other criminal activities. A ban on single-use vapes is set to take effect on June 1st, with significant penalties for those caught selling or possessing them for sale.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has been steadily declining during his first three months in office, according to a New York Times average of polling data. His approval rating has fallen to approximately 45 percent, down from 52 percent shortly after his inauguration. This decline is slightly faster than that of his predecessors, and around half of the country now disapproves of his performance. Trump began his term with one of the lowest approval ratings for a president in modern history.</p>

Some argue that these individuals are driven by economic necessity and should be given another chance. The Solidarity Network with Migrants Japan is campaigning for the use of more neutral terms like "irregular stay" or "unregistered stay" to reduce prejudice and discrimination.</p>

The fossilized remains of Huadanosaurus sinensis, a newly identified theropod dinosaur, contained the remains of two small mammals in its stomach cavity. One of these mammals was a gobiconodontid, a group known to have preyed on small dinosaurs. This discovery highlights a predator-prey dynamic where dinosaurs preyed on mammals that themselves preyed on dinosaurs, creating an intriguing ecological loop.</p>
