          <p>Consumer confidence fell sharply in March, with the index of future expectations hitting a 12-year low.  This decline reflects worries about the economy and labor market, driven by pessimism among older consumers and a negative outlook for the stock market. The Conference Board attributed the drop to concerns about tariffs and a volatile stock market.</p>
