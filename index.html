          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to medically evacuate an initial group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza in the coming weeks. This government-led operation, a first of its kind during the conflict, responds to calls from MPs to aid children at risk due to the decimated healthcare system in the region. The children, selected by the World Health Organization, will travel with family members and receive treatment from the National Health Service, with some potentially entering the asylum system afterward due to the challenges of returning to Gaza.</p>

          <p>In the wake of devastating floods in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that have killed at least 274 people, authorities are defending their response and stating that foreign aid is not currently required. Rescue efforts continue as dozens remain missing after torrential rains triggered massive flooding and landslides, destroying homes. Officials attribute the disaster to shifting weather patterns from climate change, noting that an early warning was difficult due to the sudden intensity of the cloudburst, a claim disputed by some residents who felt warnings were inadequate.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is heading for its first-ever presidential runoff after Sunday's election marked an end to over two decades of left-wing political dominance. Centrist candidate Rodrigo Paz unexpectedly secured the top spot but failed to win an outright majority, setting up a second-round vote against right-wing former President Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga. The results represent a significant blow to the ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party, which has been fractured by infighting and blamed for a severe economic crisis characterized by soaring inflation and shortages.</p>

This follows a recent summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that concluded without a ceasefire, adding to the significance of the discussions for regional stability and economic outlook.

The 23-year-old is now working with families of other British victims to raise awareness and call for clearer Foreign Office warnings about the dangers of counterfeit alcohol in Southeast Asia. The incident, which occurred last November, resulted in the deaths of six people, highlighting the severe risks of poorly manufactured spirits that can contain the toxic chemical commonly found in cleaning products.</p>

          <p>Samsung is mounting a significant challenge to Apple's market dominance, particularly with its new AI-enabled mid-range devices like the Galaxy A36, which are driving strong sales growth. This comes as Apple faces criticism for a perceived lack of innovation, with recent iPhone models offering only incremental updates rather than major design or feature overhauls. While rumors suggest Apple may unveil significant breakthroughs in 2026, its current AI features are seen as lagging behind competitors like Google's Gemini, which powers Samsung's Android phones.

          <p>On the eve of a critical meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that Zelenskyy has the power to "end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to."

Analysts discuss how Beijing is leveraging cultural exports, investing in museums, and urging its think tanks to be more 'self-centred' to bolster its international image. These initiatives aim to counteract Western narratives and build influence, even as some academics call for a more relaxed grip on cultural exchange.</p>

This new wave is distinct from past movements, driven by social media and a desire to understand black history beyond slavery, with the global popularity of Afrobeats playing a significant role. Governments are also fostering stronger connections, with leaders calling for direct air and sea links and even a shared digital currency to boost trade and solidify a shared identity between the two regions.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming White House Talks Seen as Crucial for Ukraine's Security and European Stability</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Security analysts suggest that Monday's White House meeting may be more pivotal for Ukraine's future than the recent Trump-Putin summit. European leaders are attending to ensure Ukraine is directly involved in any peace deal and to press for 'cast-iron' security guarantees, presenting a united front to President Trump.

However, the immense challenge lies in whether Ukraine could accept a deal that involves territorial loss after so much sacrifice.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel conducted a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand the government secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas for the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations, organized by hostage families, reflect growing public frustration after 22 months of war and fears that further military action could endanger the captives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right cabinet members criticized the protests, claiming they benefit Hamas and delay the hostages' return, highlighting the deep political divisions over how to proceed with the conflict.</p>

          <p>Iraqi authorities have started excavating a large sinkhole south of Mosul believed to be a mass grave containing the remains of thousands of people killed by the Islamic State group a decade ago. The complex operation involves gathering surface evidence and preparing for a full exhumation, which will require international support due to site hazards. Officials will create a DNA database from families of the missing to identify the victims, who are thought to include Iraqi security personnel, Yazidis, and other civilians executed during the extremist group's control of the region.</p>
