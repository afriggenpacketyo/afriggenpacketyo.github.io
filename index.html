          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone, a resort inspired by Spanish tourism hotspots, though currently only accessible to Russian tour groups. A recent visitor described an experience on immaculate, nearly empty beaches, but under the constant watch of guards who prevent interaction with locals and enforce strict rules, such as prohibiting photography of construction sites. The resort, built near a missile testing site, is part of Kim Jong Un's plan to boost tourism, but its construction has been criticized by human rights groups over allegations of forced labor. Despite the heavy restrictions and high cost, the tourist expressed a desire to return, highlighting the surreal nature of the vacation.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has launched its 33rd cargo mission to the International Space Station, sending a Dragon capsule with over 2.5 tons of supplies, science equipment, and station hardware. The mission is also carrying a special add-on propulsion system, known as a boost kit, designed to help the station maintain its altitude, a task predominantly handled by Russian spacecraft. This capability is significant as it enhances NASA's operational control over the station's orbit. The cargo includes various scientific experiments, such as a 3D metal printer and a study on nerve regrowth, continuing the nearly 25 years of continuous human research aboard the orbiting laboratory.</p>

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department has not yet identified the victim and is working to determine how long the remains were at the location.

          <p>A German rescue charity, RESQSHIP, has reported the drowning of three young sisters, aged nine, 11, and 17, in the central Mediterranean. The girls were on a dangerously overcrowded rubber boat that departed from Libya when it began taking on water amidst high waves. The charity managed to rescue 65 other individuals, including the sisters' mother and brother, many of whom suffered from severe chemical burns from a mixture of seawater and fuel. The United Nations reports that over 700 people have died this year attempting this perilous crossing from North Africa, highlighting the ongoing humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant speech, vowing the nation would continue to fight for its freedom and pursue a "just peace." The day was marked by celebrations in Kyiv, attended by international allies like Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who pledged ongoing military support. Concurrently, a prisoner swap saw 146 soldiers exchanged on each side, and several European nations, including the UK, Norway, and Sweden, announced new military aid and defense cooperation agreements. The events unfolded against a backdrop of ongoing conflict, including a fire at Russia's Kursk nuclear plant, which Moscow attributed to a Ukrainian drone attack.</p>

He argued that the United States should increase its support for Ukraine to alter the dynamics of the conflict.

While the West struggles with project delays and weakened supply chains, China has built a highly efficient and advanced nuclear industry that now serves as a global benchmark. Sama Bilbao y León, director general of the World Nuclear Association, expressed amazement at China's industrial scale and advanced capabilities. The exclusion of China's industry from global cooperation now threatens to hinder the West's own efforts to revive atomic energy, prompting calls for a balance between competition and collaboration.</p>

This approach would allow individual faculty and students to express diverse viewpoints freely while the university itself focuses on providing an open environment for research and learning. By failing to defend this principle, universities have become vulnerable to political opportunism and risk becoming irrelevant, sectarian institutions rather than engines of knowledge for all.</p>

An earlier rescue attempt tragically resulted in the death of another climber, Italian mountaineer Luca Sinigaglia. Nagovitsyna was last spotted by a drone on August 19 on a ridge of the 24,400-foot peak, which is known for its extremely harsh and cold conditions. Her situation is grim, and it is uncertain if she is still alive.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant diplomatic and economic charm offensive, China is struggling to pull key U.S. allies away from Washington's strategic orbit. Nations in Europe and Asia, while engaging in substantial trade with Beijing, continue to prioritize their long-standing security alliances and intelligence-sharing agreements with the United States. The article argues that foundational security concerns and shared cultural allegiances form an unyielding anchor to the U.S. that economic pragmatism cannot overcome. Consequently, while allies may voice discontent with U.S. policies and seek restraint, they are not shifting their fundamental alignment, leaving a significant gap between China's global ambitions and the current geopolitical reality.</p>

The Hamas-run health ministry reported 64 people were killed in the past 24 hours, raising the total death toll to over 62,600 since the war began. Israel is calling up 60,000 reservists for the operation and plans to evacuate the city's remaining population, a move that aid organizations warn will have a horrific humanitarian impact.

          <p>Recent economic data indicates that inflation is edging higher, leading analysts to revise their predictions for the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The Senior Citizens League now projects a 2.7% COLA, up from an earlier estimate of 2.1%. While a higher COLA means increased benefits for retirees, it also reflects a rising cost of living that erodes purchasing power. An annual study from the league found that Social Security benefits have consistently failed to keep pace with the actual inflation experienced by seniors, losing 20% of their purchasing power since 2010.

          <p>The UK government is planning a major overhaul of the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels while awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that a new body staffed by independent adjudicators will be created to handle appeals more swiftly, addressing what she called "unacceptable delays." The current system sees appeals taking over a year on average, with 51,000 cases backlogged. Refugee advocacy groups argue that the focus should be on making correct initial decisions, as flawed rulings are a primary cause of the high number of successful appeals.</p>

The documents, part of a lawsuit, show a debate among superiors, with some pushing for his ordination despite clear risks. The case also raises questions about the potential canonization of former Jesuit superior general Pedro Arrupe, who was aware of the situation but may have favored a non-authoritarian leadership style.</p>

This special election measure is a direct counter to a Republican-led gerrymander in Texas and positions California as a key battleground for control of Congress.

Images circulating online show a large, stealth-designed vessel with angled surfaces and a faceted hull, likely intended to reduce its radar and acoustic signatures. The boat, which is estimated to be over 15 meters long, was painted in Chinese navy camouflage and appeared to have a cockpit, suggesting it could also be operated by a crew.

These factors could allow for a lower price point and better global supply, positioning orforglipron to capture a significant share of the lucrative market for convenient weight loss treatments, which is expected to reach $95 billion by 2030.</p>

After 15,000 miles, his only maintenance expense for the Tesla was $600 for two new tires.
