          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister after a remark about gifted rice angered the public amid rising rice prices. The incident occurred when the minister joked about not needing to buy rice due to supporters gifting him so much, a comment seen as insensitive during a time of inflation. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister, gambling with his future as underperformance from Koizumi would put pressure on Ishiba's already shaky standing. Opposition parties seized the opportunity to pressure Ishiba to address high rice prices.</p>

Rice prices have doubled over the year, leading Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to pledge to lower them.

          <p>North Korea's newest warship was severely damaged during a launch ceremony witnessed by Kim Jong Un, who criticized the failure as a criminal act. A malfunction caused the stern of the destroyer to slide prematurely into the water, crushing parts of the hull. Kim Jong Un blamed the incident on carelessness by multiple state institutions and ordered the vessel to be restored before the late June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party.
