          <p>A formal whistleblower complaint filed with USAID alleges that UN agencies, including the World Food Programme, have engaged in gross misconduct by refusing to coordinate with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for aid distribution in Gaza. The complaint, from an international aid worker, claims the UN's inaction is preventing vital supplies from reaching civilians, despite the IDF offering security and support. The allegations have drawn attention from U.S. lawmakers and officials, who are investigating claims that UN actions may be hindering aid efforts and misusing taxpayer funds.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the meeting in Alaska, President Trump and Vladimir Putin approach negotiations over the war in Ukraine with divergent objectives, while Ukrainian and European leaders watch cautiously. Experts suggest Putin aims to secure U.S. support for a peace deal favorable to Russia, potentially by discontinuing U.S. aid to Ukraine and solidifying territorial gains. Conversely, Ukraine seeks a complete Russian withdrawal and a lasting peace that respects its sovereignty. The summit's outcome is uncertain, with analysts noting the high risk of a "bad peace" that could lead to future conflict.</p>

          <p>Southern Europe is experiencing one of its most severe wildfire seasons in two decades, with an area nearly three times larger burned compared to the same period last year. Countries including Spain, Portugal, Greece, and France are battling numerous blazes fueled by record-breaking temperatures consistently exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Climate scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of the fires to climate change, which creates warmer, drier conditions and more volatile wind systems. The European Environment Agency warns that wildfires pose an urgent and growing risk across the continent.</p>

          <p>The NCAA has levied significant penalties against the University of Michigan's football program for its sign-stealing scheme, including a $30 million fine and four years of probation. While the team avoids a postseason ban and will retain its 2023 national championship, former coach Jim Harbaugh faces a 10-year extension to his show-cause penalty, effectively hindering any return to college football. Current coach Sherrone Moore's suspension was increased to three games, and Connor Stalions, the staffer behind the scheme, received an eight-year show-cause penalty for orchestrating the illicit scouting.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen a significant shift in national security decision-making, moving away from the traditional National Security Council process to a small, insular group of trusted advisers. Key figures like Vice President J. D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio now shape major policies on issues such as Gaza and Ukraine, reflecting Trump's preference for loyalty and quick decisions. This centralized approach, which prioritizes the president's instincts, has increased nimbleness but also raised concerns among experts about the risks of limiting diverse viewpoints and potentially causing policy whiplash.</p>

The suit targets a recent Department of Energy report, claiming it was secretly produced by "known climate contrarians" to undermine the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which allows for the regulation of greenhouse gases. Critics argue the report is filled with inaccuracies and misrepresents peer-reviewed research to downplay the severity of climate change.

The legal action came after Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed the head of the DEA as an "emergency police commissioner" with full authority over the local force. D.C. officials argue the move is an illegal abuse of power that upends the police command structure and endangers public safety.

          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor surged approximately 10% following the announcement of CEO Carrie Wheeler's resignation. The departure comes after an intense pressure campaign from investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, who were dissatisfied with the company's turnaround efforts. Opendoor, which uses technology to buy and sell homes, has struggled with the impact of rising interest rates on the housing market. The company has named its technology chief as an interim leader while it begins a search for a permanent CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted an injunction, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to lay off over 1,400 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 2-1 ruling states that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the employment claims, which must go through a civil service review process. The decision is a significant step in the administration's effort to dismantle the consumer watchdog agency created after the 2008 financial crisis. The dissenting judge argued the ruling effectively allows the president to unilaterally abolish a congressionally-created agency.</p>

          <p>While traveling to Alaska for his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump indicated he would take a firm position on the Ukraine war, threatening "economically severe" consequences if peace negotiations fail. In a shift from recent comments, Trump stated that any decision to cede territory must be made by Ukraine alone and expressed support for U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv short of full NATO membership. He also dismissed discussing business opportunities with Russia until the conflict is resolved, a stance aimed at reassuring European allies who have been wary of the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>A new Zillow analysis shows that while the median price for a mansion in the U.S. is now $1.4 million, there are still a few metropolitan areas where homes over 5,000 square feet are available for less. Cities such as Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, offer these large properties for under the $1 million mark. This contrasts sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion costs $6.5 million. The data reflects broader housing affordability trends, with prices for large homes rising significantly since 2021.</p>

          <p>Charity leader Krish Kandiah has offered an "olive branch" to UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick after accusing him of "xenophobia" on a BBC radio segment. The comment, which the BBC later apologized for and edited out, was in response to Jenrick's written statement about not wanting his children living near "men from backward countries." Kandiah has now publicly called for de-escalating fear and focusing on real challenges like housing and cost of living, rather than anti-immigrant sentiment.

          <p>A UK High Court judge has temporarily ordered The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, to stop accepting new asylum seekers following an injunction application from the local council. The council argued that the housing of asylum seekers at the hotel has led to an "unacceptable" risk and "great local anxiety," citing recent large-scale protests and disturbances in the area. The protests began after a resident was charged with sexual assault. The judge issued the temporary ban until a final ruling on the council's application is made next week, amidst ongoing community tensions.</p>

Goolsbee, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, indicated he needs to see at least one more inflation report to determine if the economy is still on the "golden path" of moderating inflation and a strong labor market before supporting a rate reduction.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, this article explains how minimum payments are calculated and the long-term costs of paying only the minimum. For a $3,000 balance, a typical minimum payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on the issuer's formula which often combines a percentage of the balance with accrued interest. Making only these small payments can trap consumers in a cycle of debt for years, costing thousands in interest. The article suggests strategies to escape this trap, including balance transfers and paying more than the minimum whenever possible.</p>
