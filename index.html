          <p>The Department of Homeland Security initiated "Project Homecoming," offering illegal immigrants financial incentives to self-deport. Participants receive travel assistance and a $1,000 stipend, preserving the possibility of legal return in the future. The program, authorized by President Trump, aims to save taxpayers billions by reducing the costs associated with arrests, detention, and deportation, which currently average over $17,000 per person. Illegal immigrants are encouraged to use the CBP Home App to arrange their departures, potentially returning legally in the future, otherwise they will be subject to fines, arrest, and deportation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is set to commence offshore "blue carbon" research, focusing on capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea, with the goal of accelerating decarbonization. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives, enhancing its carbon capture efforts to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This initiative is crucial given the declining CO2 absorption capacity of Japan's aging forests.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Representative LaMonica McIver faces charges for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers outside an ICE detention facility. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges, stating that McIver's conduct cannot be overlooked, prompting a strong response from top House Democrats who vow to defend McIver against what they perceive as an illegitimate abuse of power. McIver maintains that the charges are politically motivated, mischaracterizing her actions and aiming to deter legislative oversight. Despite the charges, McIver maintains that this administration will never stop her from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right.</p>

          <p>A report by the Cato Institute reveals that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center had legally entered the U.S., contradicting the Trump administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported. The report indicates that these men were admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, granted parole, resettled as refugees, or entered on tourist visas. This analysis challenges the administration's justification for invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, to deport alleged gang members. The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration to end legal protections for Venezuelans.</p>

The move follows state-backed commercial lenders reducing deposit rates to protect their net interest margin.

The deal's impact on defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualification recognition remains uncertain. While the government calls it a "reset," the ongoing negotiations highlight the permanent or semi-permanent nature of resetting the relationship.

Marine scientist Greg Asner reports that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, leading to the expulsion of algae that give corals their vibrant colors. The rising heat is speeding up coral deaths, with reefs now dying in weeks instead of years. Efforts are underway to educate tourists about using reef-safe sunscreens and to implement underwater nurseries for coral restoration, but the situation remains dire without addressing fossil fuel use.</p>
