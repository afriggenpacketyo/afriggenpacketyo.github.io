          <p>A Japanese district court has ruled that the state must pay 1.2 million yen to two asylum seekers as compensation for repeated detentions by the immigration agency. The court found that some detentions failed to consider the asylum seekers' physical and mental health, violating international human rights covenants and Japan's immigration law. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released multiple times over a decade, leading them to file a lawsuit in 2022 focusing on their treatment since 2016. The Immigration Services Agency plans to respond after reviewing the ruling's details. </p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a routine engine test at the Starbase facility in Texas. The explosion occurred while engineers were preparing for a "routine static fire test" of the rocket's engines with the craft held down on the launch pad. SpaceX described the incident as a "major anomaly," assuring that a safety perimeter was in place and all personnel were safe. CEO Elon Musk confirmed there were no hazards to nearby communities and cautioned people to stay away from the site, as the company continues to develop Starship spacecraft for crewed missions to Mars.</p>

          <p>Moises Sotelo, a respected vineyard manager in Oregon's Willamette Valley, was detained by ICE, causing widespread concern in the local wine industry. Sotelo, honored with the Vineyard Excellence Award in 2020, was arrested on his way to work, leaving his family and business in disarray. ICE alleged that Sotelo entered the U.S. illegally in 2006 and has a DUI conviction, but his family disputes this, stating he arrived in the early 1990s, and the district attorney's office found no evidence of DUI charges. His detention highlights increasing ICE activity targeting farmworkers in Oregon, sparking fear and condemnation within the community.</p>

It warns that a prolonged U.S. involvement in the Middle East would benefit China, which the U.S. National Defense Strategy identifies as the pacing threat to U.S. global primacy.

Temperatures are expected to peak between 30 and 33C in central and eastern England, with regional fire services issuing water safety warnings. For the Met Office to declare an official heatwave, threshold temperatures must be met for at least three consecutive days, varying from 25C in the north and west to 28C in eastern England.</p>

The CloudMatrix-Infer solution, leveraging this infrastructure, surpassed the performance of prominent systems in running DeepSeek's 671-billion-parameter R1 reasoning model.

          <p>The US is facing a potentially severe wildfire season with concerns that federal fire crews are underprepared due to budget cuts and staff shortages. Agencies managing public lands have been hamstrung, and climate science departments have been dismantled, undermining early warning systems. Firefighters report a lack of essential support staff, delayed paychecks, and difficulties in procuring necessary supplies, leading to plummeting morale. There are also concerns that a new directive to consolidate federal firefighters under a new agency will add uncertainty as the fire season intensifies.</p>

The deployment of the National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles has raised concerns about the militarization of dissent. Experts suggest a double standard is emerging, where criticism of the president is met with repression, while his supporters are given greater latitude.

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are gaining popularity among health enthusiasts, with some companies marketing them to people without diabetes as a way to monitor and improve their metabolic health. While CGMs have been revolutionary for diabetics, experts express skepticism about their benefits for nondiabetics, citing a lack of evidence that they lead to any health improvements. The article notes that the trend is being fueled by the MAHA movement, which promotes self-reliance and distrust of medical elites. The potential downside of glucose monitoring is that people who are alarmed by their CGM data will swap out healthy carbs such as fruit and whole grains for foods that are less healthy, which can affect other markers of health, such as cholesterol and body fat.</p>

          <p>The partnership between Mattel and OpenAI to create AI-powered toys has sparked concerns about the impact on children's imagination and privacy. A decade ago, Mattel released Hello Barbie, an internet-connected doll that listened to kids and used AI to respond, but it was discontinued in 2017 after security researchers hacked it. While AI can be a powerful educational tool, researchers suggest that AI-powered toys might not be as beneficial for children's imaginations as traditional, inanimate toys. The article suggests that toys incorporating some technology, such as the Toniebox, can be engaging without triggering dystopian nightmares.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. and is celebrated annually on June 19. The name combines "June" and "nineteenth," marking the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The holiday symbolizes unity, power, and resilience, and was officially recognized in 2021 after decades of community advocacy. Celebrations include parades, parties, concerts, and educational events, reflecting the historical legacy and ongoing importance of emancipation.</p>

          <p>Students should expect to encounter shocking and offensive views at university, according to Arif Ahmed of the Office for Students (OfS). This guidance comes as the OfS releases new guidelines for universities in England to uphold free speech, following a fine issued to the University of Sussex for restricting it. The new law aims to ensure that all aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, are open to discussion. The guidelines provide detailed scenarios for interpreting the law, balancing free speech with the need to prevent intimidation and harassment.</p>

Iran claimed the hospital was not the intended target, but rather an Israeli military intelligence site.

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that Tennessee’s law banning transition-related healthcare for minors can remain in effect. The law prohibits hormone therapies and surgeries only for their use in treating gender dysphoria, and is on its face sex-specific. The court decided to ignore this precedent and the plain intent of Tennessee’s statute, and in the process it both imposed a cruel and needless deprivation on trans children and their families, and also substantially weakened constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the sexes. What results is a kind of separate-but-equal logic of sex discrimination, in which persons of all sexes and genders are barred from opportunities that only people of certain sexes or genders require.</p>
