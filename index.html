          <p>Ashton Jeanty, the Las Vegas Raiders' draft pick, revealed he received a prank call on draft night informing him he was being traded to the Dallas Cowboys. Jeanty, who grew up in Frisco, Texas, said he hung up on the caller, who was impersonating a team representative. The call was one of many placed to NFL prospects this year; Shedeur Sanders also received a prank call that was traced to the son of Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, resulting in fines for the team and coach. Before the draft, Jeanty had expressed his desire to play for the Cowboys.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry and messaging/propaganda. The move aims to incentivize film production within America, with Trump stating, "WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!" Industry experts and international bodies have expressed concerns about the potential negative impacts, including retaliatory tariffs from other countries and harm to the global film industry. The UK media union Bectu warned the tariffs could "deal a knock-out blow" to the industry and its tens of thousands of freelancers.</p>

          <p>Gregory J. Moore, the divorce attorney for Cleveland Clinic nurse Aliza Sherman, has been charged with her murder more than a decade after her fatal stabbing in 2013. Moore, who previously served jail time for lying to police about his whereabouts during the killing and for making bomb threats, was indicted on charges including murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy. The indictment reveals Moore allegedly planned to kidnap Sherman to delay her upcoming divorce trial, and messages show him calling her to his office the night of the murder. The Aliza Sherman Fund was started in 2023 to raise money for Cleveland Clinic patients and caregivers who have experienced violence.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese low-cost retailer, has stopped shipping goods from China to the U.S. following the expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption. This exemption allowed low-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but its removal means Temu's products now face tariffs as high as 145%. As a result, Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with all U.S. sales now handled by locally based sellers and orders fulfilled from within the country. The company is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform, aiming to help local merchants reach more customers.</p>

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff is seeking re-election in 2026 in a state that has shifted back to Republican control. Ossoff is balancing his criticism of Donald Trump with a willingness to work with Republicans on issues important to Georgia, such as supporting farmers and military bases. While Ossoff has been critical of Trump's attempts to use the federal government to target critics, he also emphasizes his commitment to delivering for Georgia by finding common ground with the administration. Ossoff faces the challenge of appealing to a broad electorate while maintaining his Democratic base, particularly after recent controversies involving his stance on Israel and party leadership.</p>

The cuts to FEMA and NOAA will impair the ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and respond to emergencies. Montano emphasizes the importance of these agencies for issuing warnings, evacuation orders, and pre-positioning resources, noting that the loss of funding is particularly concerning given the increasing frequency of hazards due to climate change.

Financial markets indicate a high probability of a quarter-point reduction in the base rate, with some economists suggesting a larger cut is needed. Economists warn that Trump's trade policies could slow down trade and increase the risk of a recession, leading to falling business and consumer confidence.

          <p>The article discusses the potential for a recession caused by President Trump's tariff policies, describing the current economic state as one of "imminence." The author notes that the economy contracted in the first quarter, and while consumer spending remains stable, businesses are delaying expansion plans and prices are rising. The author suggests that a supply shock is brewing, leading to potential shortages and panic buying, and advises readers to prepare by stocking up on essential goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, intended to bring back manufacturing jobs, are instead leading to job losses in some communities, as evidenced by layoffs at Mack Trucks in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. While some workers support the tariffs in hopes of long-term benefits, others express concern about the lack of a clear plan and the economic uncertainty created by the trade war. Economists generally agree that manufacturing is unlikely to return to its mid-20th-century prominence, and technological advancements mean that even increased investment in US manufacturing won't translate into a significant number of new jobs.</p>

Beneficiaries may owe money due to errors in reporting or agency processing, and while the reduced rate is an improvement, losing half of one's benefits can still be devastating for those relying on the income.</p>
