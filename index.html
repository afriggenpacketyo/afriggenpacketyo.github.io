          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The Trump administration argued the deployment was justified due to violent riots, while California contended it was an unlawful executive action that diverted resources from critical state needs. The court did not issue an immediate ruling, but the decision will determine whether the federal government or the state controls the California National Guard in this situation. The legal battle highlights the ongoing tensions between the state and federal government regarding immigration policy and the use of military force within the U.S.</p>

          <p>California farmers and their workers are experiencing confusion and uncertainty due to contradictory signals regarding the Trump administration's immigration policies. The state's agricultural industry relies heavily on undocumented labor, and recent immigration raids have caused concern among growers and workers. The administration's stance on worksite enforcement has fluctuated, leading to confusion about whether farms will be targeted. Despite the uncertainty, workers have largely continued to show up for work, and employers are seeking guidance on protecting their employees.</p>

The movie tells stories that get to the heart of the struggle and beauty of being human in L.A., and the trans experience in general. Director Kase Peña moved to L.A. nearly a decade ago and was inspired to make her film after noticing a lack of representation for trans stories that reflected the realities of her community. For Peña, being transgender is about having the freedom to be who you are, not about passing.</p>
