          <h2>Trump Criticizes Judges Blocking Deportations of Criminals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 09:17:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump expressed his disapproval of judges who are preventing the deportation of criminals, including murderers, from the United States. He questioned how judges could block the removal of such individuals, suggesting that this undermines the country's safety and founding principles. Trump's comments followed a ruling by a Trump-appointed judge who blocked the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, marking the first time a judge has ruled against this specific application of the act. During his campaign, Trump promised a harsh crackdown on illegal immigration, and his administration has taken steps to allow illegal immigrants to voluntarily leave the country. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100 and be a multiple of 5.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement about renaming November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House clarified that it will be an additional proclamation, not a replacement for Veterans Day. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." According to the Congressional Research Service, establishing a federal holiday or national observance requires the passage of a law. The White House Press Secretary has affirmed that Veterans Day will not be renamed, but rather supplemented with an additional proclamation.</p>

          <p>More than 60 days into Israel’s total siege of Gaza, doctors are reporting a catastrophic humanitarian situation with shortages of food, water, and medicine leading to a surge in preventable illnesses and deaths, according to this New York Times article. Muneer Alboursh, director general of Gaza’s health ministry, says he is unable to provide solutions to patients calling for medicine. Humanitarian groups accuse Israel of using aid as a political tool, violating international law, as supplies dwindle and diseases surge. The blockade has severely impacted nearly two million people, with many relying on local charity kitchens amid astronomical food prices and widespread displacement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's tariffs are impacting Los Angeles' bustling ports, with approximately a third of the traffic grinding to a halt, according to the chief executive officer of the Port of Los Angeles. The tariffs, particularly on goods from China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, are causing anxiety among longshore workers and are expected to affect communities near the ports, warehouse workers, truck drivers, and logistics teams. The Port of Los Angeles handles 40% of all containerized imports into the country and is widely seen as a bellwether for the entire US economy. The situation is not expected to resolve soon, with new rules phasing in port fees on many ships built in China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Innocence Project (LAIP) has announced the discovery of new evidence in the Scott Peterson murder case, claiming it "eviscerates" the prosecution's theory and proves Peterson's innocence. The evidence includes a home burglary near the Peterson's residence on the day Laci disappeared, witnesses who reportedly saw Laci after the timeline of her death, and new research suggesting Laci was killed days later than initially claimed. The LAIP argues that the prosecution suppressed and destroyed exculpatory evidence, violating Peterson's rights to due process. While some legal experts are skeptical, the LAIP's director argues the prosecution's case was circumstantial and the jury would not have reached a guilty verdict with the new evidence.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the concept of 'soft eugenics' within the Trump administration, exemplified by policies that prioritize personal responsibility for health and limit social services. Figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are criticized for emphasizing individual choices over systemic factors influencing health outcomes, leading to cuts in healthcare and social programs that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The article also highlights Elon Musk's focus on encouraging 'smart' people to have more children while cutting foreign aid, which exacerbates child mortality and disease in developing countries. The author argues that these policies reflect a belief that the vulnerable should be culled, while the 'strong' are encouraged to procreate, undermining public healthcare and social support systems.</p>

          <p>This is a poem titled "Good Lord, These Muscadines" by Caki Wilkinson. The poem reflects on themes of longing, acceptance, and the imperfect nature of life. It uses the image of muscadines, a type of grape, to explore the speaker's feelings about a relationship and the passage of time.

          <p>This article discusses two plays, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and "Vanya," that explore the impact of image and performance in the modern era. "Dorian Gray" uses smartphones and social media tropes to critique the drive for an idealized aesthetic, while "Vanya" suggests that embodying multiple voices can be a form of liberation. The article questions whether performing a persona is a perversion of truth or a way of becoming more freely oneself. The author also highlights the difference between the plays, where "Dorian Gray" warns about misinterpreting an act as reality, and "Vanya" suggests that self-expression can be a powerful force.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen data-gathering programs that track deaths and diseases have been eliminated due to layoffs and budget cuts in the Trump administration. These programs, which include those tracking abortions, pregnancies, job-related injuries, lead poisonings, sexual violence, and youth smoking, were terminated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Experts worry that erasing these programs will leave Americans in the dark about critical health trends and issues. While the administration claims these cuts are designed to eliminate waste, health experts argue that the eliminated programs are not duplicative and are essential for understanding and addressing public health concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly scrapped over $800 million in NIH research grants focused on LGBTQ health, including studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections, according to this New York Times article. The administration claims the research is ideologically biased and based on "unscientific" premises, while critics argue the cuts create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address health disparities. The move follows a surge in federal funding for LGBTQ research over the past decade and is part of a broader dismantling of medical research infrastructure, with legal challenges and accusations of violating ethical standards in science.</p>

          <p>A Patriot air-defense system previously stationed in Israel is set to be transferred to Ukraine after refurbishment, with Western allies discussing the possibility of Germany or Greece providing another system. This decision comes as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine, including a deadly missile strike on Kyiv. Despite previous reluctance, President Trump has seemingly softened his stance on the war, meeting with President Zelensky and signing a delayed minerals deal. The transfer underscores the ongoing efforts to bolster Ukraine's air defenses amid the conflict, although challenges remain in meeting the country's demands for more systems.</p>

          <p>Despite growing concerns about the economic impact of Trump's tariffs, Republicans in Congress are working to protect his trade policy. They blocked a Senate resolution that aimed to repeal the tariffs and prevented consideration of another resolution to block tariffs on Canada. The moves come as data shows the US economy shrank in the first three months of the year, which economists attribute to the tariffs. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the tariffs as a gamble that will pay off, while Democrats accuse Republicans of owning the policy and its potential consequences.</p>

          <p>Eight men, including seven Iranian nationals, were arrested in Britain as part of two separate counterterrorism investigations. The arrests are a result of concerns over national security, with some of those detained accused of preparing a terrorist act. The Metropolitan Police are working to establish any potential motivation and to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public. The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, described the arrests as "serious events" and emphasized the ongoing need to adapt to national security threats.</p>
