          <p>A passenger train in southern Denmark derailed after colliding with a slurry tanker, resulting in the death of a 60-year-old woman and injuring 27 others. The crash occurred near the German border between Tinglev and Kliplev, with two of the five seriously injured individuals remaining in critical condition. Emergency services are working at the scene, using a crane to check for additional victims underneath the damaged carriages. The incident involved 106 people, including a group of schoolchildren who were not seriously harmed but will receive psychological support.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its lunar exploration program by successfully test-firing the engines for its new-generation Long March-10 rocket. The test confirmed that the 21 YF-100K engines, distributed across the main stage and two boosters, can operate in sync under various power conditions. This superheavy launcher is designed to be powerful enough to send a 27-tonne payload into a trans-lunar orbit. The current plan involves using two Long March-10 rockets to launch the Mengzhou crewed spacecraft and the Lanyue lander separately for a planned moon landing by 2030.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes meeting in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded without a definitive deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump described the talks as "productive" and noted progress on several points, but conceded that a final agreement was not reached. Putin called the summit a "starting point" for improving U.S.-Russia relations, which he stated are at their lowest since the Cold War, and proposed a future meeting in Moscow. The discussions did not include Ukrainian representatives, raising concerns about potential compromises affecting the country's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, English football legend Wayne Rooney discusses pivotal moments from his life and career, from his youth to his current role as a pundit. He credits a conversation with Everton's under-19s manager Colin Harvey as a turning point that focused him on football and away from youthful misbehavior. Rooney reflects on the sacrifices his parents made, the professional disappointments he would change, and the difficulties he faced in his transition to management at clubs like Derby County and Birmingham. He also speaks about his commitment to being an honest pundit, even if it means criticizing former teammates.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, portraying it as a diplomatic victory for the Russian president. The author argues that Trump was deferential, offering Putin a red-carpet welcome and a platform on the world stage despite his international isolation and war crimes indictment. The commentary highlights Putin's apparent influence over Trump, particularly noting Putin's reinforcement of Trump's claims about a rigged 2020 election, which Trump later recounted. The meeting is characterized as lacking substance while enhancing Putin's standing and reaffirming his narrative without any concessions on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The BBC outlines five significant observations from the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, emphasizing the lack of a concrete ceasefire agreement. The first takeaway is Putin's successful return to the world stage, marked by a warm, red-carpet welcome from Trump. Another point highlights that while an agreement was mentioned, Putin's insistence on eliminating the "root causes" of the conflict signals his maximalist demands remain unchanged. The article also notes the unusual vagueness of Trump's statements, his failure to mention Ukraine directly in his public remarks, and Putin's invitation for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Proposes Stricter Residency Rules for Mainland Chinese Spouses Citing Security Risks</h2>

          <p>Taiwan's government is planning to implement stricter residency regulations for mainland Chinese nationals, a move described by critics as an "attack" on cross-strait families. The proposed amendment, part of a strategy to counter threats from Beijing, requires applicants to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. President Lai Ching-te's administration cites security concerns, including infiltration and identity ambiguity, as the primary motivation for the policy change. This marks a significant shift in cross-strait residency governance, aimed at eliminating dual-status situations that are perceived as potential security risks for the island.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The win helped the team overcome a recent slump, which had seen their division lead evaporate. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, and the bullpen successfully protected a narrow lead, a notable improvement from recent weeks. Despite losing Max Muncy to the injured list before the game, the Dodgers capitalized on key opportunities, including a go-ahead sacrifice fly from Mookie Betts and a solo home run by Teoscar Hernández.</p>

          <p>Following a legal challenge from city officials, the Trump administration has retracted its decision to take direct control of the Washington, D.C. police force. The agreement, reached after a federal court hearing, ensures that Police Chief Pamela Smith, appointed by the mayor, will remain in command of the Metropolitan Police Department. The lawsuit was filed after the administration attempted to install a federal official to oversee the city's police as part of a broader crime crackdown. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes noted that while the president can request police services, the law does not grant full control over the department.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with Sean Hannity following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump shared several takeaways from their meeting. Trump stated that while "a lot of progress" was made, "there's no deal until there's a deal," and declined to specify the main sticking point. He expressed his belief that Putin wants to end the war and suggested the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to whom his advice would be to "make a deal." Trump also confirmed he would be open to a trilateral meeting and reiterated his belief that the war would not have started if he were in office.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, and is expected to strengthen further into a major hurricane over the weekend. The U.S. National Hurricane Center is advising Caribbean islands, including the Leewards, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, to monitor the storm's progress due to the potential for heavy rain and life-threatening surf conditions. Current forecast models show Erin's path curving northward, keeping it offshore and away from the U.S. East Coast. The storm could potentially reach Category 4 strength early next week as the hurricane season approaches its typical peak activity period.</p>

When asked about how the war might end, Trump indicated that points concerning territorial changes and security guarantees for Ukraine outside of NATO were discussed on behalf of all parties. He described the meeting as "very warm" and stated they were "pretty close to a deal." However, Trump also acknowledged that the final decision would still require Ukraine's agreement, noting that "maybe they'll say no."</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district boundaries, aiming to gain up to five U.S. House seats. This move is a direct response to a similar Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas and is intended to help Democrats win back control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment, needing a two-thirds vote in the legislature and voter approval in a special election. The proposed maps would significantly alter several GOP-held districts to create strong Democratic registration advantages, a strategy critics are calling partisan gerrymandering.</p>

This resolution followed a lawsuit filed by the D.C. Attorney General, who called the move a "hostile takeover."
