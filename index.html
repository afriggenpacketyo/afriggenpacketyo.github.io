          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former judge and Fox News host, to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation came after a contentious 50-45 vote, highlighting the deep partisan divisions in Washington. Democrats raised concerns about her past defense of President Trump's election fraud claims, suggesting she might not act impartially in her new role. Her confirmation was part of a small group of nominees pushed through before the Senate's recess, amidst a broader blockade of presidential appointments.</p>

Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's unexpected growth while also warning about the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption increases.

Brown is considered armed and dangerous, and residents have been urged to remain cautious as the search continues for the man who lived next door to the bar where the tragedy occurred.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a jobs report that showed slower-than-expected hiring. The report also included significant downward revisions for previous months, which the president called a "major mistake." The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and some Republican lawmakers, who warn that it undermines the credibility of a nonpartisan federal agency and sets a dangerous precedent. The administration defended the firing, citing concerns about the accuracy of recent data revisions from the agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration enforcement tactics in the Los Angeles area, upholding a lower court's finding that agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from controversial raids by the Trump administration that sparked protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The court affirmed that such factors do not constitute reasonable suspicion for a stop, a violation of the 4th Amendment. While advocates praised the decision for protecting constitutional rights, the Department of Homeland Security criticized it as judicial overreach undermining their enforcement efforts.</p>

Smith, who was appointed by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland, had previously maintained his investigations were not driven by politics. The Hatch Act restricts the political activities of federal employees to ensure impartiality in government functions.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reportedly initiated an investigation into allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, 'Strictly Come Dancing'.

The corporation has hired an external law firm to assist with the probe, stating it has clear protocols for handling serious complaints. This development follows a series of recent controversies and new welfare measures implemented for the long-running dance competition program.</p>

The process is more than just branding; the party cannot field election candidates until a name is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties.

As global temperatures rise, melting glaciers and thawing permafrost are making such disasters more frequent and unpredictable, forcing evacuations in other villages like Brienz. This has sparked a debate in Switzerland about the high cost of protecting and rebuilding these remote communities versus the painful option of relocation. While these villages are integral to Swiss national identity and culture, the immense financial and safety challenges are forcing a difficult conversation about their long-term viability.</p>

Witnessing his stepfather pass away at 54 without getting to enjoy retirement solidified his decision to change paths, thinking, "I don't want that to be me."

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30 million, despite the player's recent public statements expressing his desire to stay with the club. The potential sale is linked to United's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While the club insists it can make new signings without first selling players, offloading Hojlund would help ensure compliance with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. If Sesko were to arrive at Old Trafford, Hojlund's role would likely be marginalized, prompting the club to consider a sale even at a financial loss on his book value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus named Winston, a diplomatic gift to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill from Australia during World War II, died during its voyage. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, new analysis of the platypus attendant's logs by Australian researchers reveals a more likely cause. The records show that water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for a platypus as it crossed the equator, suggesting the animal essentially died from heat stress rather than the trauma of war.</p>

          <p>Decades after David Berkowitz's reign of terror, two survivors of his attacks share their stories of that fateful period in New York City. Robert Violante, who was blinded in the 1977 shooting that killed his first date, Stacy Moskowitz, recalls the sudden explosion of glass and his struggle for life. Carl Denaro, shot in the head in a 1976 attack, remembers the initial police suspicion before he was identified as a victim of the serial killer. Both men expressed relief at Berkowitz's capture, which ended the city's panic, and have since rebuilt their lives while carrying the permanent scars of the violence they endured.</p>

          <h2>Dangerous Counterfeit Labubu Dolls Exploit TikTok Trend, Posing Choking Hazard</h2>

          <p>Criminal organizations are capitalizing on the viral TikTok trend for Labubu dolls by flooding the market with dangerous counterfeit versions. UK Trading Standards officers have seized thousands of these fakes, which are poorly made and pose a serious choking hazard to children as small parts like eyes and feet easily detach. Authorities warn that these knock-offs, often sold at a fraction of the price of genuine dolls, can also be made with toxic materials. The high demand and scarcity of authentic products, driven by online scalpers, have created a lucrative market for these unsafe counterfeits, which are primarily traced back to China, Hong Kong, or Turkey.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people have been arrested following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators at protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers across England. The demonstrations took place in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, reflecting ongoing tensions over the UK's immigration policies. In response to the situation, the government has reduced the number of hotels used for this purpose and plans to end their use entirely by 2029. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to restore control and reduce the overall number of people housed in the system.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin harshly criticized his players' performance following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening league match. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point," lambasting their lack of bravery and aggression compared to their opponents. He specifically called out two unnamed players for wanting to "do what they want to do" and urged some on the squad to "drop their ego," identifying the issue as a problem of mentality rather than tactics. The public rebuke, coming just one game into the season, has drawn significant attention and concern from pundits and fans.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters are battling for a single, multi-million dollar NFL contract. Incumbent Matt Hayball, a former Geelong Cats player, is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, who recently finished a standout career at the University of Alabama. Both athletes are graduates of the ProKick Australia academy. The situation epitomizes the cut-throat nature of the NFL, where only one will secure the lucrative roster spot by the final cuts on August 26, leaving the other unemployed and hoping for an opportunity with another team.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a sharp performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his strong outing was marred by two home runs from Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. The Dodgers ultimately lost 4-0. Despite the loss, Snell's return is a positive sign for the team, as he filled the strike zone and showed dominant stuff, flashing the potential that earned him a $182 million contract and bolstering the team's rotation for their championship defense.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested nearly 1,000 undocumented migrants who were working illegally at the Sheba Gold Mine in the country's northeast. The arrests were part of a week-long operation targeting illicit mining activities at one of South Africa's oldest and richest gold mines. Those detained, many from neighboring countries like Eswatini and Mozambique, will face charges for immigration violations and potentially for illegal mining. The issue of illegal miners, known locally as "zama-zamas," is widespread in South Africa, where thousands of abandoned mines have become hubs for dangerous and unregulated activity.</p>

          <p>The deadly search for food in Gaza continues, with health officials reporting that at least 24 more people were killed by Israeli forces on Saturday while trying to access aid. This brings the weekly death toll in such incidents to over 325, occurring despite Israeli assurances of humanitarian pauses. Aid agencies report that nearly all food convoys are looted by armed gangs and desperate crowds before they can be properly distributed, as a U.N.-backed report confirms a famine is unfolding. The crisis prompted a visit from U.S. officials to an Israeli-overseen distribution site, which has itself been the location of numerous fatalities.</p>
