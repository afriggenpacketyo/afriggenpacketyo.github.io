          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs have been born at a Czech safari park, a significant step in a conservation program aimed at their survival. The subspecies, which went extinct in the wild in the 1960s, is being carefully bred in captivity to maintain genetic diversity. While plans to reintroduce them to their native habitat in North Africa's Atlas Mountains are in early stages, this birth represents a hopeful development for the majestic species. The zoo is coordinating with international partners and Moroccan authorities to explore the long-term possibility of returning the lions to the wild.</p>

          <p>Borrowers seeking student loan cancellation through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program are encountering significant new challenges. A recent executive order signed by President Trump aims to narrow eligibility, excluding employees of organizations involved in certain activities, though the full impact remains unclear. Additionally, the shutdown of the SAVE repayment plan has created a processing backlog for borrowers trying to switch to other eligible plans, stalling their progress toward forgiveness. Experts advise affected borrowers to remain on course while these administrative and policy shifts are resolved. (not investment advice)</p>

The talks occurred just days before a White House deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal or face severe economic penalties, including potential secondary tariffs on countries purchasing its oil. While Russian officials described the conversation as "useful and constructive," the U.S. has indicated that the new sanctions are still expected to be implemented.

          <p>Israel's military chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, has reportedly cautioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against a full occupation of the Gaza Strip, calling it a potential "trap." During a security discussion, Zamir is said to have expressed concerns that expanding military operations into all areas of Gaza could endanger the remaining Israeli hostages. This warning comes as Netanyahu's government debates its next steps in the nearly two-year-long war, facing international pressure for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. The security cabinet is expected to meet to discuss the options for continuing the military campaign.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a destructive fire that ravaged Altadena, resident Laurie Scott has created a "Regrow Altadena" stand to distribute free plants, seeds, and soil to her neighbors. The initiative aims to restore a sense of hope and bring life back to a community that lost much of its lush greenery and personal gardens. Scott, who found personal solace in a houseplant after the fire, has since given away over a thousand plants, with community members and local experts contributing to the effort. The project provides a tangible way for residents to reconnect with nature and begin the long process of rebuilding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's threat to impose "secondary tariffs" on countries trading with Russia represents a major escalation in its economic pressure campaign to end the war in Ukraine. This strategy, which would tax goods from nations like China and India if they continue to buy Russian products, could disrupt global markets and potentially raise energy prices. While the U.S. hopes this will cripple Russia's war funding, the policy risks increasing costs for American consumers on imported goods and straining relations with key trading partners. India has already been hit with an initial tariff increase for its purchases of Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

Annuities are insurance contracts designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, but they are more complex and less liquid. The best choice depends on an individual's specific needs, such as their desire for lifetime income versus liquidity and their overall portfolio composition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a record-breaking season that saw them win the League One title, Birmingham City Football Club is setting its sights on back-to-back promotions to the Premier League. Under the ownership of Knighthead, the club has undergone a significant transformation, including major investments in the St Andrew's stadium and plans for a new sports quarter in the city. Despite a turbulent first year of new ownership that resulted in relegation, the club quickly rebounded. Manager Chris Davies and the team are now embracing the high expectations as they begin their Championship campaign.</p>

          <p>A new case before the Supreme Court, NetChoice v. Fitch, questions the constitutionality of a Mississippi law requiring parental consent for minors to create social media accounts. This challenges the precedent set in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011), which affirmed that states cannot broadly restrict the ideas to which children are exposed. The case follows a recent decision that allowed age-gating for pornographic sites, raising questions about whether the Court will further contract First Amendment rights for young people. The outcome could reveal the Court's direction on free speech in the digital age.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, citing the country's continued purchase of Russian oil. This move brings the total tariff rate on Indian goods to 50% and is part of a broader set of "reciprocal tariffs" targeting numerous countries, which are scheduled to take effect this week. The administration's stated goal is to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and exert economic pressure on nations, in this case, to discourage trade with Russia amid the war in Ukraine. Experts have warned that these broad tariff policies could disrupt global markets and the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's decision to incinerate over $9.7 million worth of contraceptives will deny more than 1.4 million women and girls in five African nations access to essential healthcare, according to the IPPF. The NGO projects this will lead to 174,000 unintended pregnancies and 56,000 unsafe abortions in countries like the DRC, Kenya, and Tanzania. The ready-to-use contraceptives, many not expiring for years, were destroyed because U.S. rules prohibit aid distribution to organizations involved with abortion services.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to place Washington, D.C., under direct federal control, citing an assault on a former staffer from the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). According to a police report, 19-year-old Edward Coristine was assaulted during an attempted carjacking by a group of teenagers, two of whom were arrested. In response, Trump called for harsher prosecution of juvenile offenders and stated he would "federalize" the city if local authorities did not address crime. This revives a contentious idea, as revoking D.C.'s home rule, established in 1973, would require congressional action and face significant opposition.</p>
