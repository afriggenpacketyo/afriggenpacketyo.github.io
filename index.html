          <p>American Airlines' new first-class suites, featuring sliding doors, are set to debut in June 2025.

The suites will first be available on flights between Chicago O'Hare and London Heathrow, followed by other routes later in the year. This upgrade reflects American Airlines' efforts to enhance its premium offerings and compete with rivals.</p>
