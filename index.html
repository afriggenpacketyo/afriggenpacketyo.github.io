          <p>British fintech firm Revolut has announced its first $1 billion annual profit, marking a significant achievement as it prepares to launch its UK bank later this year. The company's net profit for 2024 reached £1.1 billion, a 149% increase year-over-year, with revenues growing by 72% to £3.1 billion, driven by growth in its wealth unit, subscriptions, and loan book. Revolut secured a banking license with restrictions in July 2024 and is now in the "mobilization" stage, building out its banking operations and infrastructure, aiming to offer loans, overdrafts, and mortgages upon full launch, with the aim of becoming the primary bank for everyone in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has finalized new regulations, known as the Children's Codes, requiring social media platforms and websites to protect children from harmful online content or face potential fines. Sites hosting pornography or content promoting self-harm must implement robust age verification checks, and algorithms must filter out harmful content from children's feeds. Platforms must also establish streamlined reporting systems and designate a person accountable for children's safety, with annual risk management reviews, with Dame Melanie Dawes calling it a "gamechanger." Companies failing to comply by July 25 could face fines or court orders preventing their operation in the UK.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to the employment of his former son-in-law at a now-defunct budget airline in Thailand. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law received 217 million won in salary and housing allowances from the airline between 2018 and 2020, considered a bribe paid by businessman Lee Sang-jik in exchange for Moon's favor. This indictment adds Moon to the list of former South Korean leaders facing criminal trials, a recurring pattern in the country's political history.</p>

          <p>Japan will implement a revised road traffic law starting April 2026, imposing fines for minor traffic violations committed by cyclists, such as using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights.

The fines will range from 3,000 yen to 12,000 yen depending on the violation, with the aim of reducing accidents involving bicycle riders following a rise in bicycle commuting during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci, experienced a significant drop after reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales, with revenues falling 14% year-on-year. Gucci sales, which constitute nearly half of the group's total revenue, declined by 25% amid ongoing efforts to revitalize the brand. The company attributed its overall weakness to a 25% sales decrease in Asia and a 13% dip in both North America and Europe, facing challenges in the luxury market due to higher inflation and weaker economic conditions. Kering named Demna Gvasalia as Gucci's new artistic director in an attempt to reverse its ailing sales. </p>

          <p>Denise Fergus, the mother of murdered toddler James Bulger, is urging the government to enact a new law to curb the use of AI-generated videos depicting child murder victims. She said TikTok has not responded to requests to remove videos showing digital clones of her son discussing his abduction and murder, but TikTok has stated it has removed the videos. Fergus believes existing laws are insufficient to compel platforms to remove harmful content and prevent AI misuse, emphasizing the emotional distress caused by these videos. A government source said the users posting these videos could be prosecuted for public order offences relating to obscene or gross material under the Communications Act.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged as trade turmoil drives investors to the safe haven, while U.S. Treasurys and the dollar have declined, with gold prices hitting $3,500 per ounce.

J.P. Morgan anticipates gold averaging $3,675 per ounce by the fourth quarter of 2025 and reaching $4,000 by the second quarter of 2026, as gold's inflation-hedging qualities and lack of credit risk make it an attractive investment.</p>

          <p>China is reshaping the global scientific publishing landscape by showcasing its growing scientific soft power through changes to its scientific journal ranking system. The National Science Library under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) released an updated Journal Ranking Table, categorizing journals into four tiers based on self-defined evaluation criteria, which is now a critical component of China's research evaluation system. Some established international top-tier journals were downgraded, while domestic Chinese journals displayed improvements, with some advancing to higher rankings.</p>

          <p>Construction has commenced for a casino resort in Osaka, near the 2025 World Exposition venue, despite concerns about potential noise disruptions during the international event. The integrated resort (IR), featuring a large hotel, conference facilities, and gambling areas, is slated to open on Yumeshima, an artificial island in Osaka Bay, by 2030. The Osaka prefectural government and the operator have implemented measures to minimize the impact on the expo, including scaling down work during peak visitor days and delaying heavy machinery operations until after the event.</p>

          <p>A baby boy has been "born twice" after surgeons lifted his mother's womb out of her abdomen during a life-saving operation to remove cancerous cells on both ovaries behind the womb. Lucy, a special needs teacher diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 12 weeks pregnant, underwent the procedure at 20 weeks, with doctors fearing the cancer would spread if they waited until after the baby's birth. The baby was returned to Lucy's womb, and she later gave birth to a healthy baby boy, weighing 6lb 5oz, with the procedure only being carried out a handful of times across the world.</p>

While traditional forecasting methods provide insights, prediction markets are assigning significantly higher odds of a recession in the coming year, and real-time GDP estimates indicate a potential slowdown. Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor, estimates the odds of a U.S. recession as high as 60% for the coming year, emphasizing the need for vigilance.</p>
