          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 04:16:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine in London have been downgraded, excluding key US figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This occurs amidst speculation Russia might accept current front lines for concessions, including recognition of its Crimea sovereignty. Ukrainian President Zelensky rejects ceding Crimea, while an advisor insists on a ceasefire as a path to further talks. Despite Putin's Easter truce claims, attacks persist, and Russian military progress slows, with recent drone strikes hitting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. The conflict's roots trace back to 2014, involving Crimea's annexation and eastern Ukraine fighting.</p>

China dominates the rare earth market, and the US is potentially unprepared for shortages. The Trump administration is considering tariffs on critical mineral imports in response.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing exceeded expectations due to increased spending on pay and benefits, reaching £151.9bn in the year to March. This figure is significantly higher than the official forecast of £137.3bn. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is attending IMF and World Bank meetings amid concerns about US tariffs impacting UK trade. The IMF has downgraded the UK's economic growth forecast from 1.6% to 1.1% for 2025, citing tariffs, rising borrowing costs, and inflation. Economists suggest potential spending cuts and tax rises to meet borrowing rules.</p>
