          <p>At least 47 people, including 15 children, have died following devastating flash floods in central Texas, with dozens more, primarily from a children's summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in under an hour, overwhelming communities and prompting a massive search and rescue operation involving over 160 air rescues. Officials have described the event as a mass casualty incident, with hundreds of people rescued from trees and rooftops. State and federal disaster declarations have been made to provide resources for the affected counties as recovery efforts continue.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed for a crowd of 65,000 at London's BST Festival, delivering a show that was noticeably toned down from her typically racier performances. The 26-year-old artist, known for her sexually confident brand, adapted her set for a more family-friendly audience, forgoing some suggestive choreography in favor of fan-friendly interactions like firing t-shirts into the crowd. Despite the changes, the article notes her performance was still highly effective, showcasing her talent and versatility as an entertainer who can cater to different audiences. The show highlighted her professional ability to balance her established brand with the context of a large, diverse festival crowd.</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses started their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-1 loss to France, raising concerns about their ability to defend their title. Pundits and players noted that the team was outplayed and seemed to lack aggression, with first-half goals from France proving decisive despite a late goal from Keira Walsh. The analysis points to issues in the midfield, where England was overrun, and individual errors that played into France's strategy. This defeat places England in a difficult position in their group, needing strong performances in their upcoming matches against the Netherlands and Wales to advance.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were injured at a food distribution site in southern Gaza, in an attack the organization attributed to Hamas. This incident occurred alongside Israeli airstrikes that killed 14 people in the region, including a doctor and his three children, complicating ongoing ceasefire negotiations. While Hamas has given a 'positive' response to a U.S.-led truce proposal, significant disagreements remain with Israel over the terms. The violence underscores the perilous conditions for both civilians and humanitarian personnel as diplomatic efforts to halt the nearly 21-month war continue.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that a negotiating team will be sent to Qatar for indirect ceasefire talks, even as his office labeled Hamas's proposed changes to the deal as "unacceptable." The move follows Hamas's statement that it issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day truce in the ongoing conflict. While President Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon, the Israeli government's stance indicates that significant obstacles remain. The negotiations aim to resolve the nearly 21-month war that has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flooding in Texas, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledged public criticism regarding the timeliness and clarity of weather warnings. She stated that the Trump administration is actively working to upgrade what she described as "neglected" and "ancient" systems at the National Weather Service and NOAA. Noem explained that while a flood watch was issued, the storm's unpredictable stalling led to an unprecedented amount of rain that was not fully anticipated. The administration's goal is to modernize these technologies to provide families with more advanced notice in the future.</p>

Residents and critics question why evacuations were not ordered sooner, especially for the numerous youth summer camps located along the Guadalupe River. The debate highlights the challenge of communicating imminent danger and the potential for public desensitization to frequent weather warnings, prompting calls for improved alert systems.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Donald Trump has employed the "Madman Theory," a strategy of deliberate unpredictability, to reshape U.S. foreign policy and coerce both allies and adversaries. The approach, characterized by contradictory statements and sudden policy shifts, has successfully pressured NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. However, its effectiveness against adversaries like Russia and Iran is questionable, with some experts arguing it could backfire by provoking them to pursue nuclear weapons. The strategy risks undermining trust in the U.S. as a reliable partner, potentially leading allies to seek greater strategic independence.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first public appearance since the recent 12-day conflict with Israel, attending a religious ceremony in Tehran. State media broadcast footage of his appearance, which followed a period of speculation about his whereabouts during the war, where he had only been seen in pre-recorded messages. The conflict involved a surprise Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, followed by retaliatory strikes from Iran and U.S. involvement. Khamenei's public return occurred during the mourning period of Muharram, a significant time in the Shia Muslim calendar, signaling a return to normalcy for the leadership.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," aiming to provide an alternative to the two-party system and give Americans "back your freedom." The move follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump, primarily over a major spending bill that Musk vehemently opposed. Musk, who was a major donor to Trump's campaign and a former adviser, suggests the new party could gain leverage in Congress by targeting a small number of key seats. The announcement marks a significant political maneuver by the billionaire, stemming from his belief that both major parties are failing the public.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy met with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, signaling a reset in relations following the collapse of the Assad regime. The new government is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group previously proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK, prompting questions about the engagement. Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" and aims to support a move towards stability, inclusivity, and peace, while monitoring the new government's actions regarding human rights and minority protections. The visit comes as Western nations, including the U.S., have begun lifting sanctions against the country.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards at Newport Beach rescued 350 people from the ocean on July Fourth due to powerful and dangerous rip currents. In one significant incident, a "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 swimmers far from shore, requiring a large-scale rescue effort involving lifeboats and aerial support. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for Southern California beaches through the holiday weekend. The event serves as a stark reminder of ocean dangers as hot weather draws large crowds to the coast.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration raids continued across Southern California on the Fourth of July, leading to more detentions and sparking criticism from local officials and communities. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were seen detaining workers at a car wash in West Hollywood and a food vendor in Eagle Rock, actions that officials called a "deeply troubling reminder of federal overreach." The ongoing raids, which have resulted in over 1,600 arrests, have been met with sustained protests, including demonstrations at a Galaxy soccer match. The enforcement actions on a national holiday have intensified fear and anger within immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has unilaterally halted a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles, reportedly due to concerns about low U.S. weapon stockpiles. However, Democratic lawmakers and Pentagon officials have refuted this claim, stating that U.S. forces are fully equipped and that there is no evidence of a shortage. This marks the third time Hegseth has paused aid, a decision that has surprised and concerned both Ukraine and European allies. The move is seen by critics as a politically motivated delay that undermines Ukraine's ability to defend against intensified Russian attacks.</p>

          <p>Facing a nearly impossible target of 536 runs to win against India, England's cricket team is signaling a potential shift away from its aggressive, win-at-all-costs "Bazball" philosophy. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick suggested that securing a draw is a viable and sensible option, a departure from the team's long-held mantra of never playing for one. With seven wickets remaining on the final day, surviving for a draw would preserve their 1-0 series lead. This situation presents the first major test of the team's rigid attacking doctrine under coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes.</p>
