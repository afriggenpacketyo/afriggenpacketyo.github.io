          <p>Democrats are increasing scrutiny of President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures, particularly the $TRUMP meme coin, as a vote on stablecoin regulations approaches. Representative Maxine Waters disrupted a hearing on digital asset allocation, while Senator Richard Blumenthal launched an inquiry into the Trump family's crypto activities, including a "pay-for-play scheme" involving a dinner with Trump for top $TRUMP holders. Blumenthal is demanding records from Fight Fight Fight LLC and World Liberty Financial, citing potential conflicts of interest and national security risks. Democrats are betting that highlighting potential corruption will resonate with voters souring on Trump's economic policies.</p>

Republicans hope the tax bill can blunt the economic damage caused by the Trump tariffs, but that is highly unlikely.

          <p>India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, following a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian defence ministry said the strikes were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the April 22 attack accountable. Pakistan has denied any involvement in last month's attack, describing the strikes as "unprovoked." India said it targeted "terrorist infrastructure" and emphasized that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities.</p>

          <p>A Kentucky mom, Holly LaFavers, discovered a $4,200 charge after her eight-year-old son, Liam, ordered 70,000 Dum-Dum lollipops on her Amazon account.

          <p>Alphabet and Apple shares fell after Apple's services chief, Eddy Cue, suggested that AI search engines will eventually replace traditional search engines like Google. Cue said Apple may add AI services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic to Safari. The comments came during a Justice Department lawsuit against Alphabet over its dominance in advertising technology markets. Google pays Apple billions per year to be the default search engine on iPhones, and Cue's comments cast doubt on the long-term stability of the relationship.</p>

House Republicans had ruled out lowering the amount the federal government pays states to care for working-age adults who became eligible for the program through the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. Ultraconservative Republicans vented their opposition, in a public reminder that Mr. Johnson’s efforts to stave off a revolt of mainstream lawmakers could cost him crucial support from his right flank. The House budget plan calls for $880 billion in cuts from the committee that oversees the program, a target that would be difficult to achieve without substantial changes.</p>
