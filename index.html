        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a drop of over 1% following OPEC+'s agreement to increase production in June. The decision to surge production by 411,000 barrels per day is nearly triple the forecast, raising concerns about an oversupplied market amid fears of a recession spurred by U.S. tariffs. This situation is expected to negatively impact investment in exploration and production by oilfield service firms, as major companies like Chevron and Exxon have already reported lower first-quarter earnings due to the weak price environment.

          <p>A World War II-era Philippine navy ship, intended as a target for a joint U.S.-Philippine military exercise, sank unexpectedly due to rough seas while being towed, leading to the cancellation of the live-fire drill. The BRP Miguel Malvar, formerly the USS Brattleboro, had a distinguished service history, including involvement in the Battle of Okinawa. The exercise was planned near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a point of contention between the Philippines and China, and was part of larger drills focused on defending Philippine sovereignty in the South China Sea. The incident underscores the tensions in the region and the ongoing military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reduced the default withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits after announcing a 100% withholding rate weeks prior. While this change offers some relief, experts warn that even a 50% reduction in benefits can cause significant financial hardship for beneficiaries who rely on these payments for essential needs. Overpayments can occur due to various reasons, including errors in reporting or processing information, and beneficiaries often have limited recourse. Advocates continue to push for fairer repayment terms, emphasizing that beneficiaries should not suffer due to errors they did not cause.</p>

Instead, they argue for embracing the many kinds of families that already exist and lowering barriers for all individuals hoping to start new ones.

          <p>Ohio authorities have charged Gregory J. Moore, the former divorce attorney of Aliza Sherman, with her murder, marking a breakthrough in a cold case that has remained unsolved since 2013. Sherman, a Cleveland Clinic nurse, was fatally stabbed, and Moore, who previously served jail time for lying to police during the investigation, is now facing charges of murder, aggravated murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy. The indictment reveals that Moore allegedly planned to kidnap Sherman to delay her upcoming divorce trial, and messages between Moore and Sherman show how he lured her to his office on the night of her death.</p>

          <p>Temu, the low-cost online retailer, has ceased shipments of Chinese-made goods to U.S. customers following the expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption.

Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with all sales in the U.S. now handled by locally based sellers and orders fulfilled from within the country.

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff is balancing his criticism of President Trump with a commitment to bipartisanship as he seeks re-election in 2026. Ossoff, the only Democratic senator up for re-election in a state Trump carried in 2024, is carefully choosing his battles, challenging Trump on some fronts while expressing a willingness to collaborate. He faces the challenge of appealing to a diverse electorate, including those who voted for Trump, while maintaining support from his Democratic base. Ossoff's strategy involves focusing on delivering for Georgia and highlighting his work with Republicans on issues important to the state.</p>

The cuts, including those to Fema and Noaa, will leave emergency managers operating blindly, potentially leading to higher death tolls and increased devastation. Montano also notes that Fema has denied federal assistance for multiple disasters and that the administration has lit the world's premier emergency-management agency on fire.</p>

The financial markets are anticipating a quarter-point reduction in the key base rate, although some economists argue that a larger cut may be necessary. Trump's trade battles are expected to lead to a slowdown in trade and raise the chances of a recession. There are concerns that the president's tariffs could stoke inflation, while other economists suggest that border taxes may pull down inflation in other countries.</p>
