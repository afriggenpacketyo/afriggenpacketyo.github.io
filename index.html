          <p>Two Minnesota medical practices are suing UnitedHealth Group, alleging negligence related to a cyberattack on Change Healthcare, a United division, which paralyzed the healthcare payment system last year. The practices claim United is pressuring them to repay loans provided during the disruption, while also denying claims for patient care due to late submissions. Senator Ron Wyden criticized United's prioritization of its bottom line over patient well-being, highlighting the impact on small businesses and families. UnitedHealth confirmed paying a $22 million ransom to cybercriminals and reported $3.1 billion in cyberattack-related costs, and maintains that it is actively working with providers to establish flexible repayment plans based on individual circumstances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering unauthorized immigrants free airline tickets and a $1,000 stipend to voluntarily return to their home countries. Participants are instructed to use the CBP Home app to signal their intent to leave, after which they will be deprioritized for arrest by ICE, provided they demonstrate progress towards departure. DHS officials claim this initiative is a "dignified way" to leave the U.S. and would save the government money compared to the costs of arrest, detention, and deportation. However, those who have been in the U.S. illegally for over a year may face a 10-year ban on reentry.</p>

President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on films produced abroad initially caused Disney's stock to drop, however it reversed slightly positive before noon ET. CrowdStrike's stock rose after Citizens JMP raised its price target, citing the company's continued momentum. Wells Fargo's CEO noted the strength of consumer health and progress in regulatory and risk controls, expressing confidence in the removal of the Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap.</p>

          <p>Emmitsburg, Maryland, a town that supported President Trump's pledge to cut federal spending, is now grappling with the sudden cancellation of in-person classes at the National Fire Academy.

FEMA suggests the cancellation is due to travel costs, but former academy superintendent Denis Onieal warns that Americans will pay the price for the lack of training.

Ford CEO Jim Farley declined to comment on the financial impact of the tariffs or whether the company would revise its 2025 guidance.

A TransUnion analysis found that consumers facing default have seen their credit scores drop by 63 points on average, with super prime borrowers experiencing drops of up to 175 points. Experts warn that the impact can be dramatic and immediate, making it harder to obtain credit and resulting in higher interest rates. Borrowers are advised to contact the department for options on getting current.</p>

While many big productions are lured away from Los Angeles by tax credits in England or Australia, and plenty of lower-budget movies shoot in less populated countries overseas to keep costs down, some of the Los Angeles downturn comes from movies shooting elsewhere within the United States. Trump's vaguely but forcefully worded announcement trades on a bit of fashionable xenophobia, implying that movies shot in other places carry dangerous levels of propaganda.</p>
