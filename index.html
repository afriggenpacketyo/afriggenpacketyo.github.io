          <p>According to this article, JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) and JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (JPST) aim to provide downside protection and income for investors. JEPI's strategy involves writing out-of-the-money options, which can generate income when volatility is high and offer some upside when volatility is low. JPST focuses on fixed income to provide stability and principal protection. In April, JEPI fell around 3%, while JPST remained virtually flat, outperforming the S&P 500, which was down almost 5% during the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reports that U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing analyst expectations. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, indicating a healthy labor market. While the job market remains robust, there are concerns about the impact of trade policies and government layoffs on future economic activity. Despite the positive job numbers, GDP shrank 0.3% in the first quarter, mainly due to increased imports ahead of tariff implementation. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates following the latest employment data.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his appeal to reinstate his official security detail when visiting the United Kingdom, according to this article. The court rejected his argument that his family's safety is at risk without taxpayer-funded police protection, which was downgraded after he stepped down as a senior royal. Harry argued that private bodyguards are insufficient and that he feels reluctant to bring his family to the U.K. due to security concerns. The court concluded that his concerns did not translate into a legal basis for challenging the government's decision.</p>

          <p>ExxonMobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling oil prices. The company's production growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, combined with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of lower oil prices. CEO Darren Woods described the market as "choppy" and noted that tariffs have raised uncertainty about future demand. ExxonMobil's global production increased by 20% to 4.55 million barrels per day, and the company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses how Germany’s domestic intelligence service has classified the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as an extremist party, enabling the agency to use more powerful surveillance tools. The classification is based on a report finding that the AfD promotes an ethnic concept of the people that discriminates against migrants. The AfD has dismissed the classification as a political move, but leaders of the party have been known to trivialize the Holocaust and denigrate foreigners. The classification opens a legal avenue to potentially ban the party.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that President Trump signed an executive order aiming to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS, accusing the news outlets of producing biased coverage and “left-wing propaganda.” The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to end federal funding for NPR and PBS to the extent allowed by law. The White House criticized the broadcasters’ coverage of topics such as the Covid-19 pandemic and Hunter Biden. NPR and PBS receive a small portion of their funding from Congress, with the rest coming from donors and sponsors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the closure of 25 scientific centers that monitor US waters for flooding and drought, according to this article. These centers, part of the United States Geological Service (USGS), track water levels and quality, providing critical data for flood warnings and drought declarations. The decision was based on lease expirations, not scientific reasoning, and the administration has not indicated a plan to fill the gaps left by the closures. Critics argue this move could jeopardize human life and water supplies.</p>

          <p>This article discusses new research indicating that drought and resulting water loss due to global warming may be causing parts of South Africa to lift out of the ocean by two millimeters each year. While rising seas threaten South Africa's coastlines, the loss of groundwater is lightening the land, causing it to rise. Scientists used GPS measurements, satellite data, and hydrological models to study the correlation between droughts and land uplift. While this may offer a buffer against rising sea levels, it comes at the expense of less water being present on the land surface.</p>
