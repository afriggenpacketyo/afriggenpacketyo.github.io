        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant drop following Israel's military strike on Iran, triggering investor anxiety about a potential escalation of conflict in the Middle East. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also declined, while oil prices surged due to concerns over disruptions to Iranian oil flow. Analysts suggest the market's initial response was contained, but the risk of a wider military conflict remains a significant concern as Iran is expected to retaliate over the coming weeks. Airline stocks suffered losses due to rising fuel costs and travel sentiment concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the deportation or detention of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, citing concerns over the Trump administration's use of foreign policy interests as justification. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Rubio's determination that Khalil's activities compromised U.S. foreign policy. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech chilled, leading to irreparable harm. While the government could still pursue deportation based on alleged omissions on his green card application, the judge determined the current detention was primarily due to Rubio's determination.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has responded to criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren after Senator Alex Padilla was removed from a DHS press conference. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused Warren of trying to revise history, stating that Padilla entered a high-security facility under false pretenses and disrupted an invite-only press conference amid ongoing civil unrest. While Padilla and Noem later had a brief meeting, other Democrats have also called for Noem's resignation.

          <p>The United States military is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles launched at Israel after Tel Aviv's attacks on more than 200 targets in Iran. The U.S. had recently moved military assets into the region, including Navy destroyers and ground-based interceptors. President Trump indicated the U.S. was aware of Israel's plan and expressed satisfaction with Israel's performance. Iran launched counterattacks, and Israeli defense systems are intercepting missiles over Tel Aviv. U.S. stock markets closed lower as the strikes fueled fears of a broader regional conflict.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the key questions that will determine the outcome of the war between Israel and Iran, including whether Israel's objective is limited to demolishing Iran's nuclear program or includes regime change. It also examines Iran's capability to retaliate and how the conflict will affect Iran's thinking about acquiring a nuclear bomb. The author notes that the answers to these questions are currently unknown, but assessing what is known can clarify the implications of recent events. The conflict could escalate depending on whether Iran is truly weak or has simply seemed that way.</p>

The last major parade was after the Gulf War in 1991, and presidential inaugural parades often include military personnel. The event follows a years-long push by Mr. Trump to host a parade, dating back to his first term.</p>

          <p>Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery, has resigned after Donald Trump attempted to fire her, accusing her of partisanship and support for DEI. The Smithsonian Institution initially rebuffed Trump's effort, asserting its independence in personnel decisions. Sajet's resignation comes after a direct confrontation between the White House and the Smithsonian Institution. Sajet stated that stepping aside was the best way to serve the institution, while the White House reiterated its commitment to restoring American greatness and celebrating the nation's history.</p>
