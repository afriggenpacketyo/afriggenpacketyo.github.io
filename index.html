          <p>The Women's Health Initiative, a long-standing study impacting women's healthcare, is facing federal funding cuts, potentially ending the research initiative. This study of over 160,000 women, initiated in the 1990s, has significantly influenced medical practices, including the prevention of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. The cuts will terminate contracts for regional centers in September, although the clinical coordinating center will be funded through January 2026. Researchers fear this will hinder further insights into aging, cognitive function, cancer detection, and disease risk prediction.</p>

          <p>Warnings of retail shortages are surfacing as CEOs of major American retailers alert President Trump to the potential consequences of a prolonged trade war with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the situation as "unsustainable," with declining manufacturing orders and freight bookings already impacting the supply chain. Apparel and footwear are particularly vulnerable, as imports from China constitute a significant portion of U.S. supplies. If high tariffs continue, U.S. consumers may face persistent shortages, especially as Chinese suppliers shift focus to other markets. </p>

This ruling prevents the administration from ordering election officials to assess the citizenship of public assistance recipients before allowing them to register. The judge allowed enforcement of sections related to enforcing pre-existing laws, such as making voting databases accessible to identify non-citizens and taking action against states that do not require mail-in ballots to be received by election day.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is facing criticism for fielding local election candidates who have allegedly posted offensive content online, despite claims of improved vetting. Campaign group Hope Not Hate has highlighted examples of candidates sharing hate speech, far-right conspiracies, and praise for extremists. Examples include candidates suggesting the use of a "nuke bomb" to remove Islam and promoting conspiracy theories about Muslims. Reform UK has yet to respond to requests for comment, while some candidates have deleted or hidden the posts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut or withhold federal funding from public schools participating in certain diversity and equity initiatives. The judge found that the administration's actions would cripple educational institutions and violate executive branch power. The ruling is limited to public schools working with the National Education Association and the Center for Black Educator Development. The suit was filed after the Trump administration demanded states agree that their schools would not participate in programs violating the administration's definition of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>

The nonprofit board controlling OpenAI is considering selling its control, potentially turning OpenAI into a public benefit corporation.

His work explored the meaning of music to people and its significance in their lives. Davis lamented the perception of jazz as elitist, but he wrote about it in a way that could reach a broad audience.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to reinstate its ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces. This appeal follows multiple court rulings against the ban, which the administration argues is necessary for military readiness. The ban stems from an executive order that asserts transgender troops' sexual identity harms military readiness and conflicts with military values. Lower court judges have deemed the policy discriminatory and insulting.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has paused a key section of President Trump's executive order that makes sweeping changes to voting and elections. The executive order instructed the independent Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to change the national mail voter registration form to require that applicants show a document proving U.S. citizenship before they can be registered to vote. A court order issued Thursday puts that instruction on hold. The decision also pauses a second provision of Trump's executive order that requires government agencies that give out voter registration forms to assess citizenship before giving forms to enrollees of public assistance programs.</p>
