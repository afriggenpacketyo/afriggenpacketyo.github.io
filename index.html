          <p>An accident at Coney Beach Pleasure Park in Porthcawl, Wales, resulted in minor injuries for thirteen children and one adult. The incident occurred on the "Wacky Worm" roller coaster when a cart reportedly derailed, causing a metal railing to fall. Eyewitnesses described hearing screams as adults rushed to help the children off the ride, with seven individuals subsequently taken to the hospital for further treatment. The park, which is slated for closure and redevelopment, will remain shut while police and safety officials conduct an investigation.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a defeated Republican candidate for the New Mexico state House, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for organizing a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his November 2022 election loss, which he baselessly claimed was fraudulent. Although no one was injured in the shootings, prosecutors highlighted that Peña hired co-conspirators and personally participated in one attack. The sentencing reflects a firm response to political violence and attempts to intimidate elected officials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the concept of U.S. secondary sanctions, a tool used to influence third-party countries and entities by restricting their access to the American market if they do business with a primarily sanctioned nation. Leveraging the global dominance of the U.S. dollar, these sanctions pressure compliance from those not directly subject to U.S. law, as seen in policies toward Russia, Iran, and North Korea. While they can be effective in compelling negotiations, experts note they are difficult to enforce, risk alienating allies, and can push targeted nations to find economic workarounds, making them a complex instrument of foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter's 0.7% growth but better than the 0.1% forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest expansion. While the government hailed the figures as positive, opposition parties criticized the slow pace of growth, and economists expressed doubt that this momentum could be maintained. Factors such as a weak global economy and the impact of tax rises are expected to present ongoing challenges.</p>

His advocacy, particularly in the years before President John F. Kennedy's assassination, was instrumental in the creation and ratification of this crucial amendment, which outlines the transfer of power.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, significantly beating analyst expectations. The surge is largely attributed to the booming demand for its artificial intelligence servers, as the company is a key manufacturing partner for Nvidia. Foxconn, best known as the primary assembler of Apple's iPhones, has been strategically expanding into the AI sector and electric vehicles. The company forecasts its AI server business revenue will grow over 170% in the next quarter, though it remains cautious about evolving global conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

U.S. composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that Pinkfong's 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection.

The publisher cited issues with the review process and a lack of internal alignment for the cancellation, denying it was related to censorship.

The lawsuit, filed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, challenges the legality of using troops for domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act. Justice Department lawyers argued the act doesn't apply and the court lacks jurisdiction, while the judge expressed concern over the government's claim of unchecked authority to deploy a "national police force."

          <p>The Trump administration plans to deploy federalized National Guard troops along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to address crime in the city. According to a source, the deployment is intended to create a significant and visible military presence for residents and tourists to see. While a president can activate the Guard to protect federal property, the use of troops in a relatively safe, tourist-heavy area is considered an extraordinary show of force. The joint task force will reportedly involve 800 activated members, who will work in smaller shifts.</p>

          <p>A federal court hearing has wrapped up for a lawsuit challenging the construction and operation of an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe are suing to shut down the facility, arguing it was built without the required environmental impact assessment under federal law. A key issue in the case is determining whether the state of Florida or the federal government is in control. Plaintiffs presented evidence that the facility is harming endangered species like the Florida panther and contaminating the fragile wetland ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old New York man has been federally charged with cyberstalking a relative of Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO who was fatally shot in December 2024. Prosecutors allege that Shane Daley left multiple threatening voicemails for the family member just hours after the killing. In the messages, Daley allegedly expressed approval of the murder and stated that Thompson's children and other family members deserved a similar fate. The charges highlight the intense and sometimes violent public anger directed at the health insurance industry, which prosecutors believe motivated both the killing and this harassment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing the regulatory process for commercial rocket launches in the United States. The order directs the Department of Transportation to eliminate or speed up environmental reviews required for launch licenses issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The White House stated that "inefficient permitting processes" discourage investment and limit the competitiveness of U.S. space companies. While the move could benefit private firms like SpaceX, environmental groups have criticized it as reckless, warning it puts people and wildlife at risk.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the proportion of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young people, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Only 50% of adults aged 18 to 34 reported drinking, and this demographic is more likely to view alcohol consumption as unhealthy. Experts suggest that increased health awareness, changing social norms, and the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives are contributing to this shift.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that sunscreen products in mousse form may not be effective at protecting users from harmful UV rays. The agency sent warning letters to five companies, including popular brands Supergoop! and Vacation Inc., stating their products are unapproved drugs. The FDA also raised concerns that the products are packaged in containers resembling whipped cream cans, creating a risk of accidental ingestion. The companies were given 15 days to address the violations, which include misbranding and lacking required FDA approval.</p>

          <p>The Xiluodu dam, one of the world's largest hydropower stations, has replaced its Western-made industrial control chips with domestically produced alternatives. This move is part of a broader Chinese initiative to enhance the security of its critical infrastructure by reducing reliance on foreign technology. The programmable logic controllers (PLCs), originally from companies like Siemens and Schneider Electric, are essential for the dam's safe operation. The replacement addresses growing concerns about vulnerabilities in industrial systems, highlighted by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares to meet with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the family of David Barnes, an American serving a 21.5-year sentence in Russia, is hopeful for a prisoner exchange. Barnes has been detained since January 2022 on charges of child abuse that were investigated and deemed not credible by law enforcement in his home state of Texas. Unlike other high-profile American detainees, Barnes is not officially designated as "wrongfully detained" by the U.S. State Department, a status his family is urgently seeking. They hope the high-level summit will create an opportunity to secure his release.</p>

Lai, who founded the popular Apple Daily newspaper, has been a vocal critic of Beijing and faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces. His case is seen by critics as a key indicator of the erosion of free speech and legal autonomy in Hong Kong under the national security law imposed by China in 2020.
