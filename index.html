        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Burberry is set to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,700 roles as part of a cost-cutting initiative expected to save Â£60 million by 2027. This decision follows a previous Â£40 million cost-cutting measure announced in November, bringing total estimated savings to Â£100 million. The job cuts will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and the Castleford factory in England, impacting about 20% of Burberry's overall headcount. CEO Joshua Schulman aims to revive the brand's fortunes amidst a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and geopolitical tensions, focusing on timeless pieces like the signature trench coat, which poses a challenge due to its longevity limiting repeat purchases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is planning to fully cover childbirth costs, potentially starting in April 2026, as a measure to combat the country's declining birthrate. This policy, approved by a panel of experts, proposes covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by medical insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures. While the government provides a lump-sum payment, delivery costs often exceed this amount, and there are concerns from obstetricians that the move could financially strain medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

          <p>Grigory Melkonyants, co-founder of the Russian election monitoring group Golos, was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of working with an "undesirable organization." The charges relate to Golos's past affiliation with the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, which was declared "undesirable" by Russian authorities in 2021. Golos, founded in 2000, had previously documented widespread election fraud and was labeled a "foreign agent" in 2013. Amnesty International has listed Melkonyants as a prisoner of conscience, stating that he is being persecuted solely for his civil activism.</p>

The FDA plans to phase out animal testing for monoclonal antibodies, while the EPA aims to revive a ban on animal testing.

          <p>China and Russia have agreed to construct a nuclear power plant on the moon to provide energy for the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), targeted for completion by 2036. The agreement, signed during President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, establishes a foundation for the lunar reactor, which is crucial for sustaining a human presence on the moon. With the ILRS, China and Russia plan to establish a permanent research base on the moon's south pole to conduct space research and test technologies for long-term lunar habitation.</p>

Trump's actions, such as suggesting the "vice-presidential thing" to bypass term limits and his past defense of emoluments, demonstrate a pattern of prioritizing personal interests over constitutional values.</p>

These debates highlight divisions between anti-woke liberals and postliberals and raise questions about the impact of power and compromise on intellectuals.
