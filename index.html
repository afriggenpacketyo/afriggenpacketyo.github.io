          <p>Chime, a financial technology company that identifies as a technology company and not a bank, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM". The company generates revenue from interchange fees on debit and credit card purchases made by its 8.6 million active members, two-thirds of whom consider Chime their primary financial institution. In the March quarter, Chime reported a net income of $12.4 million on revenue of $518.7 million, representing a 32% revenue growth. However, Chime's IPO plans faced delays due to market volatility following President Trump's tariff announcements, joining other companies like eToro and Klarna in postponing their debuts.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market surpassing pre-tariff levels and a slower pace of inflation reported in April, investors remain wary due to uncertainty surrounding tariffs. The S&P 500 has recovered since the start of the year, but concerns persist about the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits. The Federal Reserve is adopting a wait-and-see approach before lowering interest rates, awaiting further data on tariff-induced inflation. Uncertainty is causing businesses to delay investment decisions and consumers to reduce spending, potentially slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is facing criticism for publishing misleading or inaccurate claims on its "Wall of Receipts," which touts savings for taxpayers. Despite claiming $170 billion in savings, only $70.9 billion is itemized, and many entries raise doubts about their accuracy. CBS News identified errors, including a $38.7 million contract for wastewater monitoring that DOGE claimed to have canceled, but which the CDC confirmed was merely modified. Critics like Nat Malkus argue that DOGE's math definition of savings doesn't accurately capture actual savings, and the true savings is likely around $80 billion.</p>

Biden and former First Lady Dr. Jill Biden have pushed back against claims of cognitive decline, asserting that those making such claims were not present to witness his daily work ethic.

          <p>California's plan to make ethnic studies a high school graduation requirement is in jeopardy as Governor Newsom withholds state funding, delaying the mandate amidst renewed controversy. The pause has left school districts in limbo, as the mandate requires additional funding to cover the cost of materials, teacher staffing, and training. Some districts are moving forward with ethnic studies regardless, while others are shelving the class until the law forces them to offer it. Concerns about antisemitism and the presentation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in ethnic studies curricula have also fueled debate, leading to proposed legislation aimed at ending campus antisemitism.</p>

Mental health clinicians and advocates are urging the administration to defend the regulations, arguing that they are essential for ensuring access to affordable mental health care.
