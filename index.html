            <p>China's foreign ministry has asserted it will take strong countermeasures to safeguard its interests following the implementation of increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Spokesperson Lin Jian emphasized the need for equality and respect in any dialogue, echoing the commerce ministry's stance that China will defend itself against a tariff or trade war. The country's Finance Ministry had previously announced additional tariffs on U.S. goods in response to new levies imposed by the Trump administration, though Beijing hopes the U.S. will meet halfway and lift trade barriers. China also claimed it fulfilled the terms of the "Phase 1" trade deal struck with Beijing during Trump's first presidential term, while claiming the U.S. violated certain mandates in the agreement.</p>

            <p>Facing escalating trade tensions and high tariffs, some Chinese exporters are abandoning shipments mid-voyage to avoid substantial costs. This drastic measure, dubbed “preparing for the Long March,” reflects concerns about a prolonged downturn in cross-Pacific trade. A staff member at a China-listed export company noted a significant drop in US-bound container volume due to the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Some clients are reportedly surrendering goods already en route, deeming them unsalable after tariffs are applied.</p>

            <p>President Trump's latest tariffs on imported goods from numerous countries have taken effect, prompting debate about their potential impact. Tariffs are taxes on goods bought from other countries, typically a percentage of the product's value. Trump argues that tariffs will boost the U.S. economy by encouraging domestic consumption, increasing tax revenue, and attracting investment. However, economists warn that tariffs could harm the global economy, increase prices for consumers, and disrupt supply chains. Some countries are considering retaliatory measures, while others are seeking negotiations with the U.S.</p>

The Reserve Bank of India cited increased uncertainties and new headwinds for global growth and inflation due to tariffs. Governor Sanjay Malhotra indicated a shift to an accommodative stance to support economic growth, while also stating that India is better positioned to manage the tariff impact due to its smaller trade surplus with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, marked by tariffs exceeding 100% on Chinese goods, has raised concerns about its potential impact on the global economy. Trade between the two nations totaled approximately $585 billion last year, with the U.S. importing significantly more from China than vice versa. Tariffs are expected to increase the cost of goods for consumers in both countries, and China may restrict exports of vital metals to the U.S. Some suggest the U.S. could tighten technological restrictions on China. The conflict could impact other countries, potentially leading to a reshaping of global trade relationships.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs pose a significant threat to Vietnam's economic ambitions, along with other Southeast Asian countries. Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore are hit with some of the highest tariffs. The tariffs endanger the export-driven economic development of the region, particularly for Vietnam and Cambodia, where exports to the U.S. contribute significantly to their GDP. While the official message from Southeast Asian governments is to negotiate, the Trump administration appears unwilling to compromise.</p>

            <p>The United States has restricted access to the SEER cancer database for thousands of Chinese scientists as part of new science policies targeting China. Researchers from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau have been denied access to the database, managed by the U.S. National Cancer Institute. The move is part of a security update by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), blocking access to institutions in designated countries, including China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. A researcher at Fudan University described the ban as a serious scientific event, potentially diminishing the practicality of cancer research.</p>

The country is willing to discuss the matter with President Trump, but not under U.S. pressure. Trump imposed an additional 50% in import duties after China responded to an earlier tariff increase with equivalent measures on U.S. goods. Washington has raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a cumulative 104% in several phases since Trump's return to the White House.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's efforts, the US and Iran remain far apart on nuclear issues ahead of planned talks in Oman. Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, offering negotiations and seeking a deal within months. The US threat to Iran is explicit: agree to a deal or face military action. In 2015, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear ambitions in return for lifted sanctions, but Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018, reimposing sanctions and claiming the deal rewarded terrorism.</p>
