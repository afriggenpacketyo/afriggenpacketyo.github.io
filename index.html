          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., following an event. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended at the scene and reportedly chanted "free, free Palestine" after the shooting, also revealing the location of the weapon used. Officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, condemned the violence as an act of terrorism and anti-Semitism, while Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, described it as a "depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism". The victims were a couple about to be engaged, with the young man having purchased a ring with plans to propose in Jerusalem the following week. This event prompted a swift response from law enforcement and expressions of support from various political figures. </p>

          <p>Canada is in discussions with the United States regarding participation in President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense program, as confirmed by Prime Minister Mark Carney. The proposed $175 billion system aims to defend against a range of missile threats, including drones and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Carney emphasized the importance of having protections in place for Canadians, acknowledging the growing missile threats that could originate from space in the near future. These discussions occur amidst evolving US-Canada relations, with Canada also exploring trade and security alliances beyond the United States.</p>

          <p>The House Rules Committee advanced a revised version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a megabill supporting President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, to the full House after a marathon hearing. Key changes include moving up the start date for Medicaid work requirements to December 31, 2026, and raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000. The bill also renames MAGA accounts to "Trump" accounts and expedites cuts to clean energy credits. The Department of Homeland Security would appropriate $12 billion to states for border security, and the bill ends the tax on silencers. </p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot ‚Äúmega tsunami‚Äù could potentially devastate America's West Coast if a strong earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, which could impact cities like Seattle and Portland. The resulting tsunami could cause coastal land to sink by as much as 6.5 feet, with the most severe effects expected in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California. Unlike gradual climate events, this potential earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving no time for adaptation.</p>

Some personal customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen in the attack, though payment details and passwords were not compromised.

          <p>President Trump's trade tactics are complicating India's relationship with Apple, an American company that has reoriented its production away from Chinese suppliers. India had hoped to leverage the trade war between the U.S. and China to attract businesses, but Trump has changed his tactics, backing off his highest tariffs on China. He also demanded that Apple move its production to the United States instead of India, creating uncertainty for India, which is working to secure a reduction in the 26 percent tariff imposed by the U.S. on its goods. The situation highlights the challenges India faces in navigating the complex trade landscape under the Trump administration.</p>

The program has no set end date, but with around 1 trillion yen allocated, it could last until the end of March 2026.

          <p>President Trump publicly dressed down the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, based on a fringe conspiracy theory about white South Africans being killed. Trump claimed that white people were ‚Äúbeing executed‚Äù and questioned Ramaphosa's efforts to address the situation. However, police statistics do not support the claim that white people are more vulnerable to violent crime than other people in South Africa. This confrontation highlights Trump‚Äôs views on race, where he frames white people as victims and minorities as having an unfair advantage.</p>

The legislation seeks to balance demands from fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans.

The bill also proposes work requirements for Medicaid and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), as well as lifting the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.</p>

          <p>A federal judge stated that the Trump administration "unquestionably" violated a court ruling by attempting to deport eight migrant detainees to third countries, including South Sudan, without allowing them to contest their removal. The would-be deportees had criminal convictions, including for homicide and sexual assault. The judge ordered the administration to retain custody of the deportees and give six of them "reasonable fear" interviews. Despite the judge's order, a DHS spokeswoman criticized the ruling, calling it "absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America."</p>
