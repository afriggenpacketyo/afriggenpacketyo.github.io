          <p>In a detailed interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution not as a sanitized event but as a bloody civil war, calling it the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ for creating the concept of a "citizen." He emphasized that the nation has always been deeply divided and that studying its history, with all its complexities and flaws, is essential for navigating the present. Burns advocates for a commitment to lifelong learning as a core responsibility of citizenship to sustain the republic.</p>

          <p>White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the new tax and spending law, predicting it will spur 3% economic growth and ultimately reduce the deficit, dismissing official CBO projections as historically flawed. In response, Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi sharply criticized the bill, arguing it would dangerously inflate the deficit, keep interest rates high, and cause millions of Americans to lose their Medicaid coverage. The exchange highlights the deep partisan divide over the legislation's fiscal and social consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Christian girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, located on the Guadalupe River in Texas, has been devastated by historic flash floods that have killed at least 70 people statewide. The camp's longtime director and several young campers are among the dead, with eleven other campers and a counselor still missing from the site. The deluge transformed the camp, a cherished place of friendship and prayer, into a scene of destruction, with personal belongings scattered and hope for finding more survivors fading.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed to make a call on a point-ending shot from Sonay Kartal. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, her opponent, argued the ball was clearly out, a fact later confirmed by TV replays. The chair umpire, unable to make a definitive call himself, ordered the point replayed, leading Pavlyuchenkova to claim the decision "stole" the game from her and fueling debate about the reliability of the new automated system.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men, who had served prison sentences for serious crimes including murder and sexual assault, to South Sudan. The move followed a protracted legal battle and a Supreme Court ruling that sided with the Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to third countries. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national, with the others being from countries that reportedly refused to accept them, highlighting an expansion of this controversial deportation practice.</p>

          <p>The dire state of Libya's healthcare system is highlighted by the story of a 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis whose family undertook a dangerous boat journey to Italy to find treatment. Political instability since 2011 has crippled the country's medical infrastructure, leaving many families unable to access essential care and medications. The girl's story went viral, but activists say it is a symptom of a larger state failure that could encourage more desperate families to risk their lives at sea.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of vandalism after portraits in the Windrush Untold Stories exhibition in Brixton, south London, were damaged. The outdoor art installation features portraits and stories of people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between the 1940s and 1970s. While community groups had feared the act was racially motivated, the Metropolitan Police stated that they do not believe it was a hate crime and sought to reassure the public.</p>

          <p>Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has spoken out against White House-led efforts to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, calling the move "foolhardy and misguided." In a recent interview, Burns argued that defunding public media entities like PBS would disproportionately harm rural areas where they may be the only broadcast signal available. He emphasized that his own critically acclaimed films, which require long production times, would not have been possible without the public broadcasting system.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are in a critical week of negotiations to secure a trade deal with the United States and avert President Trump's threatened tariffs of up to 50% on EU imports. With the July 9 deadline fast approaching, the EU is reportedly aiming for a framework agreement similar to one the UK secured, as a comprehensive deal seems unattainable. The uncertainty has created economic anxiety, with internal division in the EU over whether to accept a potentially imbalanced deal or risk a trade war. (not investment advice)</p>
