            <p>Former LSU receiver Kyren Lacy passed away at the age of 24 while facing charges related to a fatal car accident from December. Lacy, who had declared for the NFL draft, was allegedly driving recklessly when the accident occurred, resulting in the death of a 78-year-old man. His lawyer stated that Lacy was crushed under the weight of an irresponsible and prejudiced process. Lacy led LSU in touchdown receptions last season and was a promising talent whose career was cut short by the legal proceedings and now his untimely death.</p>

            <p>Jane Pauley hosts our annual "Money Issue," this year focusing on securing a fulfilling retirement. Former Social Security Administration commissioner Michael Astrue says those in the Trump administration trying to drive change don't understand the system and could put benefits at risk. It was a week of monumental economic gyrations, as President Trump imposed tariffs on nearly every country's imports, which he then increased, then paused some, then instituted new tariffs. Wall Street stock and bond indices suffered, with trillions in value lost, and Americans' retirement and college savings accounts took a beating.</p>

            <p>All 15 counties in Arizona have begun verifying and removing non-citizens from voter rolls, affecting nearly 50,000 registrants who didn't provide proof of U.S. citizenship. This action follows a lawsuit arguing that counties weren't adequately verifying citizenship status, as required by state law. The counties are now working with the Department of Homeland Security to confirm the citizenship of registered voters who failed to provide the necessary documentation. The process aims to ensure election integrity and potentially enfranchise federal-only voters whose citizenship is confirmed.</p>

A spokesperson for Whitmer stated that the governor was caught off guard by the media appearance and her presence did not endorse the actions or statements made at the event. Whitmer's efforts to separate herself from the press conference come after criticism, particularly online, and as she navigates the political landscape as a potential 2028 White House contender.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are calling on the US President to “completely cancel” his so-called reciprocal tariffs, as a trade war between the world's two biggest economies grinds on. This week, Trump announced a 90-day pause for a host of global tariffs he had planned, but increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%.  The Trump administration offered a concession on Friday by announcing that some technological products - including many produced in China - would be exempted.</p>
