          <p>Shares of asset manager T. Rowe Price saw a significant increase after announcing a major partnership with Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs will invest up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price common stock, aiming for a stake of up to 3.5%. The collaboration is designed to offer private market investment products to a broader range of retail investors, including those with wealth and retirement funds. This strategic move is seen as an effort to revitalize T. Rowe Price, which has faced challenges and investor withdrawals due to its slower adoption of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

          <p>Lululemon's stock price fell over 10% in extended trading after the company issued a full-year financial outlook that was significantly below Wall Street expectations. While the athletic apparel retailer surpassed second-quarter earnings estimates, it narrowly missed revenue targets and reported a 4% decline in same-store sales in the Americas. The company's leadership expressed disappointment with its U.S. business performance and product execution. Lululemon anticipates that tariffs will negatively impact its full-year profits by approximately $240 million, contributing to the pessimistic forecast for the upcoming quarters.

          <p>Private sector hiring in the United States experienced a dramatic slowdown in August, with companies adding only 54,000 jobs, according to data from ADP. This figure fell well short of the 75,000 jobs forecasted by economists and marks a substantial decrease from the 106,000 jobs added in the previous month. The report highlighted particular weakness in the trade, transportation, and utilities sectors, while leisure and hospitality showed strong growth. This data, combined with rising jobless claims, paints a concerning picture of the labor market and increases speculation about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a contentious Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended the Trump administration's major restructuring of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He justified the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and other changes by stating that new leadership is needed to reform the agency following its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kennedy invoked his father, former Attorney General Robert Kennedy, stating, "progress is a nice word, but change is its motivator," to argue for the necessity of the shakeup. The reforms have drawn significant criticism from Democrats and over 1,000 health officials who argue they politicize public health.</p>

U.S. District Judge Zia Faruqui accused the DOJ of bringing "embarrassment and shame" on the government with a "rush" to charge individuals without sufficient evidence, leading to multiple failed indictments. The judge's comments came as he dismissed a felony case against a man who had been jailed for a week for allegedly threatening President Trump. Faruqui expressed grave concerns that the administration was prioritizing statistics over due process and undermining the constitutional rights of detainees.</p>

          <p>A financial planning guideline known as the "$1,000 a month rule" is gaining attention as a tool to help individuals calculate their retirement needs. Based on the 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that a person needs to save between $240,000 and $300,000 for every $1,000 of monthly income they wish to generate in retirement beyond Social Security. This simple formula helps transform abstract savings goals into concrete targets, making it easier for people to visualize how much they need to accumulate. The article emphasizes that while not a perfect measure, the rule serves as a valuable starting point for retirement planning. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the White House has provided few details confirming the identities of those killed or their direct involvement in large-scale drug smuggling, an activity for which the gang is not primarily known.

While the lower court removed the monetary penalty, it upheld the trial court's finding that Trump committed fraud.

          <p>Investors are closely watching for Friday's August jobs report, which is anticipated to confirm a weakening U.S. labor market. Economists predict the economy added a modest 75,000 jobs, similar to July's lackluster figure, with the unemployment rate expected to rise slightly to 4.3%. The market is hoping for a number that is cool enough to support a Federal Reserve interest rate cut but not so weak as to heighten recession fears. This will also be the first report issued since President Trump fired the previous Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, a move that has raised concerns about the integrity of federal economic data.

Effective October 1, the program will be fully replaced by the Amazon Family program, which requires all members sharing benefits to reside at the same household. This change mirrors the strategy used by streaming services like Netflix to crack down on account sharing across multiple locations to increase subscription revenue.

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to review its tariff policy, but a legal analysis suggests its own arguments may prove the tariffs are unlawful. The administration's petition highlights the policy's vast "economic and political significance," citing trillions of dollars in impact, which directly invokes the criteria of the Supreme Court's "major questions doctrine." This doctrine, recently used to strike down major Biden administration policies, posits that Congress must speak clearly when assigning such significant decisions to the executive branch. Critics argue that applying this doctrine consistently would compel the court to invalidate the tariffs, though some justices have suggested it may not apply in foreign policy contexts.</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement violates federal law and the Constitution. The suit, filed by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, seeks a permanent injunction to halt the deployment, which was initiated as part of a federal takeover of the city's police department to crack down on crime. The White House defended the action, stating the president is within his lawful authority. The lawsuit follows a recent federal court ruling that blocked a similar deployment of the National Guard in California.</p>

          <p>A new bill introduced by congressional Democrats, titled the You Earn It, You Keep It Act, proposes to permanently eliminate all federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the cost, the legislation would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000, removing the current income cap. Proponents argue this would provide financial relief to seniors while strengthening the program's long-term solvency. The proposal contrasts with the recently passed Republican tax law, which offers a temporary, income-limited deduction for seniors but does not fully eliminate the tax on benefits.

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump unlawfully imposed sweeping country-based tariffs could result in American businesses being owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds. The court found that the president improperly invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for the levies. The Trump administration has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, creating continued uncertainty for businesses that have paid over $70 billion under the contested tariffs. If the ruling is upheld, the government would need to establish a process for refunding the collected duties, which could be complex and challenging for both businesses and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Danish energy company Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an order to halt construction on its Revolution Wind project off the coast of New England. The Interior Department issued a stop-work order for the nearly completed offshore wind farm, citing national security concerns, despite the project having already passed extensive environmental and safety reviews. Orsted's lawsuit calls the order arbitrary and unlawful, alleging it is a pretext for President Trump's well-known hostility toward wind power.
