          <h2>White House Ballroom Donors Revealed Amid Rising Cost Estimates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing intensified scrutiny regarding the funding and escalating cost of a planned White House ballroom, now estimated at $300 million, significantly higher than previous projections. While President Trump asserts the project is entirely privately funded by himself and "some friends," a preliminary list of potential donors attending a White House dinner includes major tech and cryptocurrency companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Coinbase. Concerns have been raised because some of these corporations have already secured lucrative government contracts or seen major benefits under Trump's policies. Donations are reportedly being channeled through the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to preserving the National Mall and White House.</p>

          <p>Germany's Finance Ministry announced plans to pay October salaries for approximately 11,000 local employees at US military bases in Germany, anticipating potential non-payment due to the ongoing US government shutdown. This proactive measure is described as a significant sign of solidarity with US armed forces and their civilian staff stationed in the country, with the German government expecting reimbursement once the US resolves its budget issues. Separately, Chancellor Friedrich Merz faced renewed controversy and criticism for his seemingly negative and divisive remarks on urban migration. He doubled down on comments implying migrants contribute to public safety fears and affect the "public image" of cities, drawing warnings against fomenting social divisions from his own coalition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Last-minute changes to Trump administration port fees, enacted by the U.S. Trade Representative, have unexpectedly burdened Atlantic Container Line (ACL) with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill. The US-based ocean carrier was reclassified under new Section 301 program terms, impacting its unique hybrid vessels which primarily carry shipping containers but were re-categorized as roll-on/roll-off. CEO Andrew Abbott warns this disproportionate tariff could force ACL to relocate operations, severely impacting American manufacturers and exporters who rely on their specialized service. Despite appeals, the USTR indicates no changes are currently being considered, asserting that vessel classification is based on construction characteristics rather than specific cargo carried.</p>

          <h2>Expert Explains How Societies Escape Crises Fueled by Wealth Inequality</h2>

          <p>An expert analysis of over a hundred historical crises reveals that societal instability, including current democratic tensions, is frequently driven by a "wealth pump." This mechanism systematically transfers wealth from the general population to a small elite, leading to rising economic and political inequality, growing popular discontent, and an overproduction of elites competing for fixed power positions. While most historical exits from crisis involved lengthy periods of disintegration and significant upheaval like epidemics or civil wars, the article suggests that successful resolutions, though rare, are becoming more frequent in modern times. Ending a crisis requires fundamentally rebalancing wealth and power through measures such as progressive taxation, labor market restructuring, and political power regulation.</p>

          <p>Weather warnings for the UK have been significantly reduced as Storm Benjamin, named by the French weather service Météo France, has cleared away to the east. The storm initially brought the most violent winds, up to 100mph, to the northern coast of France, with a comparatively lesser impact on the United Kingdom. Currently, remaining yellow warnings are in place for rain in Norfolk and Suffolk, valid until 18:00 BST, and for wind across eastern England until 15:00 BST, suggesting a low chance of localized flooding and gusts potentially up to 55mph on coastal regions. While some earlier travel disruption and power outages were reported in the UK, more severe rain and winds are still anticipated for other parts of western Europe, including Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump confirmed that the "existing structure" of the White House East Wing must be torn down to construct a new $250 million ballroom, a significant expansion from initial plans. Demolition began earlier this week, intensifying criticism from conservationists and opposition politicians who question the transparency and lack of scrutiny for the project. While the White House is exempt from standard historic preservation acts, experts argue that best practices for historic buildings should have been followed. Trump maintains the project is fully funded by private donors and is a much-needed change, despite the strong backlash from those concerned about altering a national landmark.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing for a new $250 million ballroom has ignited a "chorus of disgust" from White House alumni and presidential historians, who view it as an "abomination" and a potent symbol of the Trump administration.

Despite initial promises that the project wouldn't interfere with the existing building, its scale has expanded significantly. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has called for a pause, expressing concern that the proposed 90,000 sq ft ballroom will overwhelm the 55,000 sq ft executive residence.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing for a new ballroom prompts a Guardian columnist to reflect on America's need for a national "renovation project." The article draws parallels between the physical alteration of the historic White House and the perceived paralysis and low trust in US institutions. It questions whether the renovation, driven by one person's "gaudy" taste and funded by private donors, truly represents "the people's house" or an "oligarchic" vision. The piece encourages imagining a collective future for the country rather than lamenting current changes, advocating for a more inclusive and democratic "American project."</p>

          <p>The US military has expanded its controversial anti-drug trafficking campaign into the Pacific, attacking and destroying two boats and killing five people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth controversially equated alleged drug traffickers to 9/11 terrorists, stating there would be "no refuge or forgiveness." This follows at least seven similar strikes in the Caribbean, which have killed 32 people and strained relations with South American nations. Colombian President Gustavo Petro condemned the actions as "murder" and a breach of international law. The White House justifies the strikes under Article Two powers, controversially linking cartels to "designated terrorist organizations" and a "non-international armed conflict."</p>

          <p>European leaders are poised to endorse a controversial plan to use €140bn worth of frozen Russian state assets, held by Euroclear, to support Ukraine. Dubbed a "reparations loan," this proposal aims to provide immediate liquidity to Kyiv, with the understanding that Russia would repay it post-war. The plan navigates legal complexities and concerns from member states, particularly Belgium, regarding financial stability and potential Russian retaliation. While Russia condemns the move as "theft," proponents like Finland's President Stubb call it "ingenious," addressing Ukraine's urgent financial needs as the war approaches its fifth year.

Rubio reiterated US opposition, calling annexation "counterproductive" and "threatening" to the fragile ceasefire currently in place.

          <p>Chess's international governing body is considering disciplinary action against Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik for persistently making unproven cheating allegations against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who recently died at 29. Kramnik had accused Naroditsky of online cheating for a year without substantial evidence, despite Naroditsky's denials and claims that Kramnik was trying to ruin his life. The federation president has referred Kramnik's statements to the Ethics and Disciplinary Commission, promising "appropriate action" against public harassment and bullying. Several grandmasters and Naroditsky himself, in his last livestream, spoke of the toll these accusations took, highlighting a toxic environment in online chess.</p>

The war, which erupted in 2023 between the military and RSF, has killed at least 40,000 people and left 30 million in need of humanitarian assistance, making it the world's largest humanitarian crisis.

It found that frequently prescribed Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) generally have fewer physical side effects, while some older drugs can have more significant impacts.
