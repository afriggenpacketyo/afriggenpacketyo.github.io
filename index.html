          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Deems California's Ammunition Background Check Law Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:18:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the court found the law infringes on the Second Amendment, stating the state failed to prove it aligns with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulations. California's Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the ruling as a setback for gun violence prevention, while plaintiffs, including an Olympic shooter, hailed it as a victory for gun owners. The state is now considering its options, which include appealing to a larger court panel or the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached a critical stage, with displaced Palestinians struggling to find food amid constant Israeli bombardment. International organizations, including the World Health Organization and World Food Program, have sounded the alarm over mass starvation, reporting that a significant portion of the population goes days without eating. Food scarcity has caused prices to surge, making basic items unaffordable for most families who have no income. Aid deliveries are falling drastically short of needs, and distribution is hampered by security challenges and logistical difficulties, leading to a desperate and deteriorating environment for civilians.</p>

          <h2>India Faces Mounting Pressure to Finalize Trade Agreement with the United States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:00:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is under increasing pressure to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. before an August 1 deadline, after which certain tariffs are set to rise. The urgency has grown following a recent U.S.-Japan trade agreement, which addressed similar issues like market access for American agricultural products, a sensitive point for India. Analysts suggest that despite these challenges, the U.S. has a strategic interest in securing a deal to position India as a manufacturing alternative to China and a key partner in the Indo-Pacific. India's role in the BRICS bloc also provides it with diplomatic leverage in negotiations with the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its 2025 profit forecast, citing the significant negative impact of U.S. import tariffs and increased sales of lower-margin electric vehicles. The company announced a 29% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling short of analyst expectations. VW now anticipates its operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, down from a previous projection of 5.5% to 6.5%. The announcement highlights the vulnerability of the European auto sector to trade policy uncertainties and robust competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is scheduled to fight Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, marking his return to the octagon nine months after a severe jaw injury. During his last fight, Whittaker's bottom teeth were dislodged by a face crank, requiring surgery and the insertion of dental implants. The 34-year-old Australian, who is currently ranked fifth in his division, stated that while regaining the title is a goal, his primary motivation is now setting an example for his children. He anticipates his opponent will try to take the fight to the ground, but he is prepared for a lengthy battle.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated his determination to limit disruption, while the British Medical Association warned this approach could stretch staff too thinly and risk patient safety. The union maintains that despite recent pay rises, doctors' pay has effectively decreased by a fifth since 2008 when accounting for inflation.</p>

          <p>Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham has stated there is no need to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in football. His comments come amid reports that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider widening VAR's use to include decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham argued that the current model already features enough interruptions to the game and that the FA's position is that the system is in a good place. Any potential rule changes would require a three-quarters majority vote from the IFAB board, which includes FIFA and the four British football associations.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to combat an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that infects livestock by laying eggs in open wounds. The spread of the parasite has prompted the U.S. to again bar imports of Mexican cattle over fears of it reaching American herds. In the state of Chiapas, veterinarians and ranchers feel they are facing the crisis alone, as the cost of medicine has soared and a new government plant to produce sterile flies for eradication won't be ready until next year. The outbreak affects not just cattle but also sheep, pigs, and domestic pets.</p>

The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving people more freedom and convenience in managing their medically necessary diet.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a tour of the Federal Reserve's headquarters, President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell publicly disagreed over the cost of the central bank's extensive renovation project. Trump claimed the cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, explaining the president's document included a separate building completed five years ago. Despite previously suggesting the project's cost overruns could be grounds for firing Powell, Trump stated he does not think it's necessary. The president reiterated his desire for lower interest rates but said he felt good about his relationship with the Fed chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County health officials have confirmed that an international traveler with measles passed through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and stayed at a nearby Hilton hotel while infectious. The exposure occurred between July 5 and July 7. Authorities are urging anyone who was at these locations during that time to monitor for symptoms and verify their vaccination status, as measles is highly contagious. This incident comes amid the largest U.S. measles outbreak in decades, with health officials emphasizing that immunization is the most effective way to prevent infection, especially as summer travel increases transmission risk.</p>

          <p>Kelly Osbourne expressed her grief over the death of her father, heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away at age 76. In an Instagram post, she quoted lyrics from their 2003 chart-topping duet "Changes," writing, "I lost the best friend I ever had." The Black Sabbath frontman died just weeks after a final farewell performance in his hometown of Birmingham, surrounded by family. The Osbourne family was famously portrayed on the MTV reality show "The Osbournes," which highlighted the close, if chaotic, relationship between the father and daughter. The family's statement did not specify a cause of death.</p>

          <p>A senior Department of Justice official, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, met with Ghislaine Maxwell in the Florida prison where she is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The interview comes amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein's network. Maxwell's attorney confirmed the day-long meeting and stated she answered every question asked. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats, who point to a conflict of interest as Blanche is President Trump's former personal lawyer. This development occurs as House Republicans have subpoenaed Maxwell to testify remotely before a committee.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding in the mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, forcing road closures and water rescues. Video on social media showed a home being swept away by the powerful, muddy currents. This is the latest in a series of floods to hit the community this summer, as the area is particularly vulnerable due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the hillsides of vegetation. The National Weather Service has been issuing routine flood warnings for the region, and on Thursday, one stretch of the Rio Ruidoso rose to approximately 12.5 feet. No fatalities or injuries were immediately reported.</p>

In a separate development, the White House withdrew Alina Habba's nomination as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, only for her to be immediately installed as the acting U.S. Attorney, a move that appears to circumvent federal judges who had selected a different candidate. Additionally, Lara Trump announced she would not run for the North Carolina Senate seat, and the president signed an executive order aimed at addressing homelessness.</p>

The plaintiffs, who include a longtime federal prosecutor and officials involved in January 6 cases, argue they were fired without cause in violation of civil service protections. Their lawsuit claims the one-page termination memos they received cited presidential power but offered no specific reason for their dismissal. They are asking a federal judge to order their immediate reinstatement and award back pay, arguing the firings were arbitrary and unlawful.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between solid surfaces. The scientists at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics were studying folded layers of graphene when they discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could aid in designing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale devices and machines.</p>

The declassification was carried out by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who claims the documents show Obama-era officials manufactured a narrative to undermine President Trump. The release has sparked concerns about risks to intelligence sources and methods, with Democrats calling it irresponsible. The CIA noted that Ratcliffe had initiated the process to declassify the report to bring more transparency to the American people.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," concluding the prosecution could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial centered on the issue of consent during the incident, which occurred after a Hockey Canada gala. While the players are now legally cleared, the NHL has stated they remain ineligible to play pending the league's own review of the court's findings.</p>
