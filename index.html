          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix reported record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, largely fueled by sustained, strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology. As a key supplier to AI giant Nvidia, the company has capitalized on the aggressive investments in artificial intelligence by major tech firms. SK Hynix expressed confidence for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventory levels and anticipating continued healthy demand in the server market, projecting that its HBM sales will double compared to 2024.

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled its comprehensive AI Action Plan, a roadmap designed to accelerate artificial intelligence development and solidify U.S. dominance in the field. The plan proposes building out data center infrastructure and promoting American technology while removing what it terms "bureaucratic red tape." However, the initiative has drawn criticism from groups like the AI Now Institute, which argue that it prioritizes the interests of large tech corporations over the public good and dismantles important safety guardrails established by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>During a Senate hearing on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Senator Mazie Hirono suggested that opposition to DEI initiatives inherently implies a distrust of her as a minority member. Her comment prompted a sharp rebuke from Republican Senator Eric Schmitt, who chaired the subcommittee meeting and called the accusation "ridiculous." The tense exchange occurred after Hirono questioned a witness from an anti-DEI legal group, and it culminated in Schmitt abruptly adjourning the hearing as Hirono continued to speak.</p>

          <p>A new Common Sense Media study finds that a majority of teenagers are now using AI chatbots as companions for advice, problem-solving, and emotional support. Researchers express significant concern that this trend could hinder the development of crucial real-world social skills and redefine human relationships. The article highlights the potential for AI to exacerbate loneliness and youth mental health crises, as teens increasingly turn to these non-judgmental but non-human platforms for serious conversations, sometimes finding them more satisfying than talking with friends.</p>

          <p>Recently freed Venezuelan migrants, who were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, have provided harrowing firsthand accounts of their time in the notorious CECOT mega-prison. They describe systematic beatings by guards, deprivation of food and water, and complete isolation from their families and any legal aid. The prisoners, who were ultimately released as part of a U.S.-Venezuela prisoner swap, recounted staging desperate hunger and "blood strikes" to protest the brutal treatment inside a facility from which few are expected to ever leave alive.</p>

          <p>A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship to be invalid and unconstitutional.

          <p>Alphabet reported strong second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by significant growth in its search and cloud divisions. However, the company also announced it is increasing its planned capital expenditures for 2025 by $10 billion, to a total of $85 billion, to meet the surging demand for its AI and cloud services. Despite the substantially increased spending forecast, the company's shares rose in after-hours trading, buoyed by the robust performance of its core businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in a May meeting that his name was mentioned multiple times in the Justice Department's files on Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing reportedly occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the files to the public. The report, citing senior officials, states Trump was also told many other high-profile individuals were named and that the files contained unverified hearsay. The White House has dismissed the story as "fake news."</p>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders as part of his administration's new AI strategy, with one specifically targeting what the White House describes as "woke" or ideologically biased AI systems. This move aligns with a broader administration campaign against diversity initiatives. The other orders aim to fast-track the construction of energy-intensive data centers by easing environmental regulations and to promote the global export of American AI technology. The actions are part of a larger plan to position the U.S. as the undisputed global leader in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The judge ruled that the government's arguments for release, including public interest and a desire for transparency, did not meet the high legal standard required to overcome the strict rules of grand jury secrecy. The decision is a setback for the administration's push for more disclosure in the case, which came after intense public pressure from President Trump's supporters. A similar request in New York is still pending.</p>

          <p>This NPR segment provides an overview of the Trump administration's immigration policies six months into the president's second term, describing the approach as one of "shock and awe." It highlights the unprecedented tens of billions in funding that Congress has recently allocated for immigration enforcement, which is fueling a large-scale deportation campaign targeting migrants living in the U.S. illegally. The report situates these actions within the broader context of President Trump's campaign promise to conduct the largest deportation effort in the nation's history.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's campaign to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into cutting interest rates is a dangerous power play that threatens the central bank's independence. The author contends this is not a debate about monetary policy but an attempt to subordinate the Fed to the government's spending needs, a situation known as "fiscal dominance." While acknowledging Powell's past policy errors, the piece warns that forcing the Fed to enable reckless government borrowing historically leads to high inflation and financial instability.

CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients were moving cautiously due to geopolitical tensions and that hardware sales were prioritized over software during the quarter.

The subsequent explosion at a training facility killed three veteran detectives, and the investigation is now focused on determining exactly how the detonation occurred and whether proper protocols were followed.</p>
