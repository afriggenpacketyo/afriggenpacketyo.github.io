          <p>Over 100,000 individuals participated in the "Unite the Kingdom" rally in central London, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, while a smaller counter-protest of approximately 5,000 people also took place nearby. Metropolitan Police reported nine arrests for various offenses and noted instances of "significant aggression," including officers being attacked with projectiles like glass bottles and metal poles from Robinson's supporters. The demonstrations, divided by a substantial police presence of 1,000 officers, saw Robinson's supporters waving nationalist flags and chanting anti-migrant slogans, while counter-protesters held signs advocating for refugees and opposing the far right. This event underscores the deep social and political tensions in the UK, particularly concerning immigration and free speech, necessitating a large police deployment to maintain order and prevent further clashes between the opposing groups.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and trusted ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot at 31 while hosting a college event for Turning Point USA, an organization he co-founded. The article details Kirk's rise as a polarizing figure known for his provocative debates on issues like climate change, faith, and gun control, often drawing fierce liberal criticism for his rhetoric on gender, race, and politics. His non-profit, Turning Point USA, founded after Barack Obama's re-election, became instrumental in mobilizing young conservatives and Republican voter efforts, playing a key role in Trump's political success. His widow, Erika Kirk, publicly vowed to amplify his message after his death, underscoring his significant and controversial legacy in American politics and youth activism.</p>

          <p>California's State Assembly passed SB 53, a bill mandating transparency reports from developers of powerful "frontier" AI models, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature. The legislation aims to mitigate "catastrophic risks" from AI, defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. While some industry groups oppose it due to compliance costs, proponents, including Anthropic, endorse the bill as a crucial step towards thoughtful AI governance. This article highlights California's trailblazing role in AI regulation amidst federal gridlock and ongoing debates over AI ethics and safety.</p>

          <p>A clinical professor advises consumers to prioritize ingredients over brand names when choosing lip oils, as some popular products have been linked to hyperpigmentation and other skin issues. Dr. Rebecca Small explains that the thin skin on lips is highly vulnerable to sun damage and irritation, which can be exacerbated by lip oils lacking SPF or containing irritating plumping agents and fragrances. She recommends lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF, linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid, while strongly advising against those with peppermint, cinnamon, citrus, lavender, or oleic acids.

          <p>Nepal's major political parties are demanding President Ram Chandra Poudel reinstate the parliament, which he dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. Eight parties, including the Nepali Congress, argue the dissolution was unconstitutional and against judicial precedents, despite it being a key demand from the "Gen Z" protest movement. Interim Prime Prime Minister Sushila Karki, appointed after a deal with protest leaders, had recommended the dissolution, and is now tasked with restoring order and addressing protester demands. This article highlights the ongoing political crisis and the struggle to balance public calls for change with constitutional order in Nepal's young democracy, which is gradually returning to normalcy after weeks of unrest.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football program is in disarray, with mounting calls for second-year coach DeShaun Foster's firing following a disastrous winless start to the season, including a humiliating 35-10 defeat to underdog New Mexico. The team is criticized for a pervasive lack of discipline, poor tackling, and an inability to score, with Foster appearing "out of his depth" and offering no clear solutions. The article attributes the mess to Athletic Director Martin Jarmond's decision to hire the inexperienced Foster, who is compared to a past Notre Dame coaching failure. It highlights the dire state of the program, which remains the only Big Ten team without a win, and the urgent need for a leadership change to salvage its future.</p>

          <p>A Montana animal shelter faced closure after a smoke cloud from two pounds of methamphetamine, incinerated by the FBI, filled its building and sent 14 workers to the hospital. City officials stated a fan meant to prevent smoke from entering was not available during the drug burn, which occurs every few months at the facility used primarily for animal carcasses. The incident, which left workers with symptoms like headaches and dizziness, highlights a critical safety lapse and raises questions about the FBI's procedure for destroying seized narcotics within city limits.

          <p>The article explores the paradox of the modern dictionary, which, despite a "golden age" for language study and unprecedented digital accessibility, faces a crumbling business model. Merriam-Webster, after abandoning an ambitious online unabridged revision, rebounded by adapting to digital algorithms and social media, even becoming a "social-media darling." However, other major American dictionaries have receded or been acquired, with Dictionary.com recently laying off its lexicographers after a sale to an ed-tech company. This article highlights how the rise of AI and free online definitions challenge traditional dictionary publishers, emphasizing the urgent need to preserve the business of chronicling and explaining language in a contentious world.</p>
