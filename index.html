          <p>President Trump stated he will not agree to a trade deal with China until the substantial trade deficit between the two countries is resolved. He emphasized that the United States loses hundreds of billions of dollars annually due to this deficit and demands a solution before any agreement can be reached. Trump also mentioned that China did not approve the TikTok deal because of the tariffs, illustrating the leverage tariffs provide. This stance underscores the administration's commitment to addressing trade imbalances despite potential economic repercussions. (not investment advice)

          <p>A U.S. judge has strongly criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting a man to a dangerous prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S., stating that his deportation was "wholly lawless." The judge's opinion highlights the lack of legal authority to arrest, detain, and deport Garcia, especially to a prison known for its harsh conditions. The Justice Department initially defended the deportation, claiming Garcia was an MS-13 gang member, but later suspended the attorney who argued the case.</p>

          <p>Newly qualified medical students in the UK are facing uncertainty over their first NHS job locations, with some only finding out weeks before starting. This is due to a new system of allocating foundation jobs, which aims to be fairer but has resulted in more students not getting their preferred placements. The British Medical Association (BMA) has criticized the government for failing to plan for an increase in resident doctors. The situation raises concerns about potential doctor shortages and students moving abroad.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Americans to "hang tough" as the 10% universal tariffs took effect, calling the implementation an "economic revolution." He stated that the tariffs would bring back jobs and businesses like never before. Trump also claimed that China has been hit harder by the tariffs than the USA. China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. (not investment advice)
