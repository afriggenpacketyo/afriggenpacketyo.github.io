          <h2>China Faces Declining Marriage Rates Despite Government Incentives</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marriage registrations in China have continued to decline, prompting local governments to offer cash rewards to young couples in an effort to combat a demographic crisis. The Ministry of Civil Affairs reported a decrease of 8% in marriage registrations in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year, coupled with a 10% increase in divorce registrations. To address this trend, China has streamlined marriage registration rules, allowing couples to register without returning to their place of household residency, although the impact of this reform may be limited. The declining marriage rates, combined with low birth rates and a shrinking population, pose significant challenges to China's economy.</p>

          <p>Senior Chinese officials have announced plans to support jobs and assist exporters in response to escalating trade tensions with the U.S., hinting at potential stimulus measures. The imposition of tariffs has led to production pauses and worker furloughs in Chinese factories, impacting the country's export sector, which has been a key driver of economic growth. The government's focus is on stabilizing employment through subsidies for companies hiring recent graduates, promoting entrepreneurship, and increasing vocational skills training. These measures aim to address concerns about labor market stability and its connection to social stability and consumption recovery.</p>

The IMF has lowered its growth outlook for the euro area due to President Donald Trump's tariff policy. While Germany's infrastructure spending bill is expected to provide some boost, the tariffs and trade tensions are projected to have a more significant negative effect on Europe's economic growth. Exemptions passed to Germany's longstanding debt rules have unlocked higher defense spending and enabled creation of a 500 billion euro infrastructure and climate fund.</p>

          <p>The 64th German finger wrestling championship took place in Pang, Bavaria, with around 180 competitors participating in the traditional sport known as Fingerhakeln. Finger wrestling is popular in the German Alpine region and neighboring Austria, with its origins dating back to the 19th century as a way to settle disputes. The competition follows strict rules, with contestants attempting to pull each other across a table using only one finger through a leather loop. The sport is highly organized and follows strict rules.</p>

          <p>A new study has linked the Han conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in southern China in 112BC to the decline of the Chinese swamp cypress, now a critically endangered species. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen analysis, and historical records to determine how the Han dynasty's riverine warfare tactics reshaped the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples from ancient battlegrounds showed a decline in swamp cypress pollen around 100BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Nanyue's capital, Panyu, which was set ablaze.</p>

          <p>Australian opposition leader Peter Dutton has criticized Indigenous "welcome to country" ceremonies as being "overdone" and inappropriate for sporting games or military commemorations. His comments follow an incident where an Aboriginal elder performing a welcome ceremony was booed by a small group. Dutton argues that the tradition should be reserved for significant events and that its overuse cheapens its significance and divides the country. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the disruption as a disgraceful act of "cowardice."</p>

While tariffs aim to protect the auto industry from foreign competition, domestic policies threaten to cut it off from innovation. China has made significant advancements in producing next-generation vehicles, posing a risk to the American auto industry.

Savory pouches contain less than 5% of the daily iron needs, and some fruit pouches contain excessive amounts of free sugars.
