          <h2>Trump Enacts Landmark "GENIUS Act" to Regulate Cryptocurrency Stablecoins</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for the U.S. stablecoin market. The bipartisan legislation provides consumer protections and defines legal standards for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. This new law allows banks, nonbanks, and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, a move supporters believe will foster innovation and enable faster, lower-cost financial transactions. The administration also approved two other crypto-related bills, signaling a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An adviser from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that the global financial system must adapt its rules to address the challenges posed by a "tokenised future." Shin Hyun-Song, a BIS economic adviser, highlighted that stablecoins present significant policy challenges, particularly concerning anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for banks. Due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature, stablecoins could complicate regulatory oversight and are seen as a primary gateway to the broader, often volatile, crypto ecosystem and decentralized finance platforms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, stated that he will continue to allow agents to wear masks during arrest operations, citing safety concerns amid a significant increase in attacks on officers. In an exclusive interview, Lyons also confirmed that ICE intends to use government data from programs like Medicaid to locate and apprehend undocumented immigrants, including those with criminal records. He attributed the increased visibility and tension surrounding ICE to the administration's expanded immigration enforcement and the prevalence of "sanctuary" policies that limit local cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has filed a $10 billion libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges the newspaper published a false and defamatory story about a "bawdy" birthday letter purportedly signed by Trump and sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling the letter a fake and an example of journalistic failure. This legal action occurs as the administration faces increasing pressure to release more information regarding the Epstein case, with the Justice Department recently moving to unseal related grand jury testimony.</p>

          <p>A general contractor in Los Angeles reports that President Trump's intensified immigration enforcement is causing significant labor shortages in California's construction industry. Many undocumented but highly skilled workers are reportedly staying home out of fear of ICE raids, leading to project delays and increased labor costs. This shortage is particularly acute as the region needs to rebuild thousands of homes destroyed by recent wildfires. A UCLA Anderson Forecast report supports these concerns, indicating that increased deportations will likely deplete the state's construction workforce, ultimately driving up costs for consumers.</p>

To coexist peacefully, experts advise against swatting at wasps and suggest distracting them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein scandal continues to be a powerful and animating issue for many supporters of Donald Trump, who view it as evidence of a corrupt "deep state" protecting a powerful elite. Conspiracy theories surrounding the case, which have been fueled for years by right-wing figures, created a political challenge for the Trump administration when it initially announced no new files would be released. For many in the MAGA base, the demand for more information is less about Epstein himself and more about a belief in a shadowy system controlling government and other institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the show is a comedic homage that avoids targeting the famous couple. Instead, it uses a myth about Coleen's lost engagement ring as the basis for a "medieval caper" with jokes and songs. The play is characteristic of Liverpool's Royal Court theatre, which focuses on original, locally-relevant comedies to entertain its audience.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's public health service is expanding its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, who are particularly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to eligible infants who were born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine offered during pregnancy. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization in a child's first year. Health officials stated the new program will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and help reduce pressure on hospitals and emergency departments.</p>

          <p>A remarkable story from 2005 is being recounted, in which a 12-year-old girl in Ethiopia was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by seven men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police, the lions chased the men away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found. A wildlife expert at the time suggested the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for the sound of a lion cub, preventing the animals from attacking her. The incident is still remembered as a "miracle."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" has intensified concerns about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While CBS cited financial pressures, the move has drawn scrutiny due to its timing, coming days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount Global's settlement with President Trump. The format faces shrinking viewership among younger audiences, declining ad revenue, and competition from social media clips, which satisfy audience appetite without requiring them to watch the full broadcast. This cancellation highlights a turbulent period for a once-dominant television genre, grappling with technological, financial, and political pressures.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria byproduct and a genetic variant that may trigger the inflammatory flare-ups of ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a molecule produced by certain bacteria can over-activate an immune pathway in individuals with a faulty version of a gene meant to regulate it. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The findings help explain the disease's unpredictability and could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway.</p>

          <p>The general manager of Boise State Public Radio, Tom Michael, discussed the severe impact that the recent cuts to federal public media funding will have, particularly on rural stations. In an interview with NPR, he explained how these smaller stations rely heavily on funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to operate and serve their communities. The loss of these funds threatens their ability to provide essential local news, emergency alerts, and educational programming. This perspective highlights how the defunding effort will disproportionately harm listeners in areas with fewer alternative media sources.</p>

The review praises the film for its unflinching honesty, showing both the palpable danger for the matador and the inescapable, ghastly fate of the bull. It is described as a spellbinding work that gracefully intertwines meditation and obscenity, forcing viewers to confront the sport's brutal singularity.</p>

Lowry stated he accepted the penalty to protect his reputation from accusations of cheating but remains unconvinced the ball actually moved.
