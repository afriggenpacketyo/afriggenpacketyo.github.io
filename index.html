          <p>Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head at a rally in Bogotá and is in critical condition. The attack has been condemned by political figures, including President Gustavo Petro and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. A 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene with a 9mm Glock-type firearm, and an investigation is underway to determine the motive behind the attack. Uribe, a right-wing critic of Petro, announced his candidacy for next year's presidential election and has been a senator since 2022, coming from a prominent political family with links to the country's Liberal Party.</p>

The UK Ministry of Defence confirmed the detention and stated that unacceptable behavior has no place in the Armed Forces, with the Defence Serious Crime Unit conducting an investigation. This incident follows previous allegations of misconduct by British soldiers at the Batuk base, including a 2012 murder case and claims of mistreatment of local people. The Batuk base, established in 1964, allows the UK to deploy up to six army battalions a year for training exercises.</p>

          <p>Experts discuss the benefits and risks of chiropractic care, noting that while it can reduce tension, inflammation, and stress, it's important to consult a spine specialist for more serious issues. Chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, but are not medical doctors, unlike spine doctors who have extensive medical training. Potential complications from chiropractic treatment can arise if underlying diagnoses are missed, potentially leading to spinal cord injury. Experts recommend a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to care and urge patients to seek transparent chiropractors with clear treatment plans.</p>

          <p>An NPR and PBS Frontline investigation examines why communities struggle to rebuild effectively after disasters, focusing on Houston, New York, and North Carolina. The report highlights failures to rebuild in ways that would mitigate future disaster risks, citing powerful forces that undermine community choices and leave homes vulnerable. In North Carolina, the investigation follows the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which revealed disparities in preparedness and resilience. Experts emphasize the need for a comprehensive vision and addressing property rights and economic factors to improve disaster recovery efforts, noting that private developers often profit while communities remain vulnerable.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid, a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics altered the gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. The study suggests this could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes, raising concerns about the widespread use of biodegradable plastics in food packaging and disposable tableware.

          <p>Beginning this summer, the Trump administration will begin garnishing up to 15% of Social Security benefits for delinquent federal student loan borrowers. However, retirees will be left with at least a $750 monthly Social Security benefit. There are two little-known but perfectly legal ways to potentially avoid Social Security garnishment. Some defaulted borrowers may qualify for the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge program, which cancels federal student loans and stops forced collections. Social Security retirees currently in default on their federal student loan(s) can also potentially avoid having their monthly check garnished by applying for a financial hardship with the DOE (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jermain Charlo disappeared in June 2018, and six years later, the investigation into her whereabouts continues. On the night she was last seen, Charlo was at The Badlander bar in Missoula, Montana, with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance. Cellphone data indicated her phone was near DeFrance's residence after she disappeared, but DeFrance claims he discarded the phone in Idaho. DeFrance, who has never been named a suspect, had previously been convicted of assaulting Charlo, and her family continues to search for answers and justice.</p>

          <p>Almost six decades after humans first walked on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are showing renewed interest in lunar exploration. The Artemis program, led by NASA and involving international collaborators, aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole. The moon is rich in resources like iron, silicon, and water, which could be used for scientific research and as a base to get to Mars. These bases could serve as "transit lounges" for astronauts on their way to Mars, and the moon could also be used for energy production.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino dismissed suggestions that he is a candidate to take over as Tottenham Hotspur manager, stating it is “not realistic” for him to leave his current role as US men’s national team manager. Pochettino enjoyed a successful run at Spurs from 2014 to 2019 and was considered a possible replacement for the recently sacked manager. He emphasized his commitment to the US national team, even after a 2-1 loss to Turkey in a friendly match. Pochettino's focus remains on improving the team's performance and developing younger players.</p>

          <p>As the Labour government approaches its first year, the upcoming Spending Review presents an opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision. Chief executives express concern that the government appears hesitant, despite holding a significant majority. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, allocating 2.7% of GDP over five years, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. Long-term certainty over capital sums could incentivize private investment, particularly in green technologies, but the government must prioritize long-term challenges and avoid short-term political considerations.</p>
