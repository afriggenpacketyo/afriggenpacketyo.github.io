          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The site, located at the remote Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, is being rapidly converted to hold up to 5,000 individuals for processing and deportation. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis praised the facility's isolated location and natural security, noting it will be operational upon the president's visit. The project has drawn protests and is funded in part by FEMA, raising concerns among critics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" proposed by Senate Republicans would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans while financially harming the lowest earners. The report estimates that the bottom 20% of households would see an average income reduction of about $700 annually, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the SNAP food assistance program. Conversely, the top 20% of households would experience an average income increase of $5,700, largely from the extension of tax cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged that the July 4 deadline for his massive tax and spending bill might be difficult to meet as Republican leaders work to secure votes from holdouts in the Senate. He issued a warning to dissenting Republicans, stating they would "pay the consequences" for not supporting the legislation. The President also addressed his ongoing feud with Elon Musk, who opposes the bill, suggesting Musk's government subsidies could be scrutinized.

          <p>North Korea is reportedly preparing to dispatch an additional 6,000 military engineers and workers to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine, deepening the military alliance between the two nations. Analysts suggest this arrangement benefits both countries, providing Russia with much-needed manpower while allowing it to avoid a broader domestic mobilization. In return, North Korea receives vital economic aid, military technology, and international prestige, helping to prop up the regime. The deployments are also used as a domestic propaganda tool within North Korea to foster nationalistic fervor.</p>

          <p>The jury in the federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs continued its deliberations for a second day. The panel began by asking the judge for clarification on jury instructions related to a drug distribution charge, one of the alleged acts in the racketeering conspiracy. On their first day, jurors had also sent a note expressing concern about another juror's ability to follow instructions, prompting the judge to remind them of their obligations. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which stem from allegations of a long-running criminal enterprise.</p>

While movable objects were relocated, larger, immovable sites and open-air archaeological complexes like Iran's Taq-e Bostan remain highly vulnerable to damage from military strikes.

          <p>As the jury weighs the fate of Sean Combs, the trial has centered on a narrative struggle between the prosecution's portrayal of him as a violent racketeer and the defense's claim of consensual, albeit unconventional, sexual behavior. Prosecutors built a case around charges of sex trafficking, prostitution, and racketeering, arguing Combs coerced women and used his businesses to facilitate a criminal enterprise. The defense conceded to domestic abuse but argued the sexual encounters were not forced, thus not meeting the legal standard for trafficking. The jury must now navigate these complex legal definitions to reach a verdict.</p>

While national average rates are modest, online banks often provide much higher yields, with some short-term CDs currently offering rates well over 4%.

          <p>The future of Planned Parenthood is in jeopardy due to a series of targeted actions by the Trump administration and a recent Supreme Court ruling, according to this opinion article. The administration has excluded the organization from the Title X family planning program, and a court decision now allows states to block Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. This ruling effectively curtails patients' rights to choose their provider and threatens to cut off a major funding stream for essential services like cancer screenings and prenatal care. The cumulative effect could force the closure of hundreds of clinics nationwide.</p>

This potential deal follows a $20 billion Airbus order from 2023, highlighting Boeing's struggle to secure new business in the critical Chinese market since 2017.

          <p>A new biography examines the revolutionary impact of American fashion designer Claire McCardell, who championed comfort and practicality for women's clothing in the mid-20th century.

The article reflects on why her name has faded from public memory despite her profound influence on modern wardrobes. It posits that her focus on sensible, ready-to-wear apparel, known as the "American Look," was a quiet revolution that has become so ubiquitous it is now taken for granted.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Prime Minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, has been suspended from office by the country's Constitutional Court, which is considering a petition for her removal. The case follows public anger over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader regarding a border dispute, leading to accusations she undermined national interests. This is the latest in a series of judicial actions against the Shinawatra family's political allies, including the ousting of her predecessor and the dissolution of the progressive Move Forward party. The suspension adds to Thailand's ongoing political instability and the cycle of conflict between elected governments and the conservative establishment.</p>

          <p>Passengers aboard a Japan Airlines flight from Shanghai to Tokyo experienced a terrifying mid-air incident when the Boeing 737 rapidly descended nearly 26,000 feet. The sudden drop, caused by an issue with the cabin pressurization system, forced the deployment of oxygen masks and led the pilot to declare an emergency. Some passengers reported hearing a boom and feared the plane would crash, with some writing farewell notes to their families. The aircraft was diverted to Osaka, where it landed safely with no reported injuries among the 191 people on board.</p>

          <h2>Lululemon Sues Costco, Alleging It Sells Unauthorized "Dupes" of Its Apparel</h2>

          <p>Lululemon has filed a federal lawsuit against Costco, accusing the wholesale retailer of patent infringement by selling unauthorized duplicates of its popular apparel. The lawsuit claims that Costco is unlawfully profiting from Lululemon's brand reputation by offering lower-priced knockoffs of items like its Scuba hoodies and Define jackets. Lululemon alleges that Costco's use of certain manufacturers for its private Kirkland label can mislead consumers into believing the products are authentic. The athleisure brand is seeking monetary damages and an injunction to stop Costco from selling the contested items.</p>
