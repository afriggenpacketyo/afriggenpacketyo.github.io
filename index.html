          <p>The Premier League has released the fixtures for the 2025-26 season, outlining key match-ups and potential challenges for top clubs. Liverpool is set to host Bournemouth, while Manchester United will face Arsenal on the opening weekend. The schedule poses immediate tests for Liverpool, with games against Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City before international breaks, which could impact England's national team preparations. The league has also acknowledged the increased likelihood of fixture changes due to the participation of nine teams in European competitions, especially the Champions League, adding complexity to the scheduling process. Manchester City's new player, Rayan Cherki, will have an early opportunity to play against Manchester United.</p>

Founded in 1955 by Jewish intellectuals, including Hannah Arendt, the LBI aimed to safeguard German-Jewish culture following the Holocaust. The institute, named after Rabbi Leo Baeck, has become a crucial research center with branches in New York, London, and Jerusalem. It houses a vast collection of digitized historical objects, including books, letters, and artwork, making them accessible to scholars and descendants worldwide. The LBI also engages in various projects, such as podcasts and publications, to maintain interest in German-Jewish heritage, while facing challenges from attacks on academic life and the rise of right-wing parties.</p>

          <p>A goods train from China has arrived in Tehran via the new China-Iran rail corridor, marking a significant step in deepening ties between the two nations. The 10,400km route aims to reduce delivery times from 30-40 days by sea to just 15 days, traversing Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. This development comes amid increasing tensions, including potential US interception of Iranian oil tankers and Israeli strikes, which pose challenges to the corridor's stability. The rail line is strategically important for Iran, allowing it to bypass vulnerable maritime channels and continue exporting oil and minerals, while also positioning itself as a central transit hub connecting China and Central Asia with Europe.</p>

          <p>Rents in major German cities have almost doubled in the past decade, despite existing laws aimed at limiting rental costs. According to an analysis by the Housing Ministry, advertised rents in the 14 largest independent cities have seen significant increases. Berlin experienced the highest rise in new rental prices at 107%, followed by Leipzig at 67.7% and Bremen at 57%, while Munich remains the most expensive city overall. Germany has regulations in place to restrict rent increases in tight housing markets, but these are often unenforced, requiring tenants to report violations themselves.</p>

Among those arrested were individuals with criminal records, including Enrique Gonzalez Moreno, who had multiple convictions for driving under the influence and illegal reentry.

Sjogren suggested that collaboration between the US and Europe is essential for developing programs with significant content from both regions, making self-sufficiency impractical and costly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to lower duty payments amid rising tariffs, which involves modifying products to fit into categories with lower rates. This practice includes altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to align with different 'harmonized system codes.' For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into products to qualify for lower duties, while others remove these elements when tariffs change. Companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse have successfully used strategic product tweaks, such as adding pockets to clothing or using fuzzy-felt soles on shoes, to reduce tariff costs.</p>

Federal prosecutors have taken the lead in the case, potentially seeking the death penalty, which has not been pursued in a Minnesota-based case since 1976.

          <p>R. Kelly was hospitalized after his lawyers claimed prison officials administered an overdose of medication as part of an ongoing assassination plot. Kelly, serving time for sex trafficking and racketeering, is reportedly in solitary confinement. His legal team has also accused the Bureau of Prisons of instructing another inmate to kill him. Prosecutors have dismissed these claims as a 'fanciful conspiracy,' arguing that Kelly is attempting to evade responsibility for his crimes.</p>

          <p>North Korea plans to dispatch thousands of military construction workers and deminers to support reconstruction efforts in Russia's Kursk region, according to a top Russian official. This move follows North Korea's provision of combat troops and conventional weapons to aid Russia's war against Ukraine. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu announced that Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers and 5,000 construction workers. The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised concerns among the U.S., South Korea, and their allies regarding potential technology transfers that could advance North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.</p>

          <p>The implementation of stricter immigration policies has led to increased fear and distress among immigrants, particularly in Southern California, where enforcement operations have become more aggressive. ICE operations have expanded, causing significant anxiety within the undocumented community. In Los Angeles, a raid at a Home Depot resulted in multiple arrests, sparking concerns about collaboration between federal and local law enforcement. While deportations have not been as massive as initially feared, the heightened enforcement has reduced the flow of people migrating to the United States and created a sense of unease among those already residing there.</p>
