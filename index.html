          <p>Ferrari's stock plummeted by 16% after the luxury carmaker provided updated financial guidance for the full year and 2030, which disappointed analysts. The company also announced a significant reduction in its electrification targets, now aiming for 20% fully electric vehicles by 2030, a decrease from its prior goal of 40%. This strategic shift is attributed to a client-centric approach and the current market environment, with deliveries of its first electric model anticipated in late 2026. Despite the immediate negative market reaction, some financial experts maintain a positive outlook on Ferrari's long-term strategic execution and leadership, believing demand still outstrips supply.

          <p>Experts allege significant investigative failures marred the federal probe into Jeffrey Epstein's death, ruled a suicide, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Lapses included delayed interviews with key corrections officers, some conducted nearly two years later, and a failure to properly preserve evidence at the scene, with FBI agents arriving over seven hours after his body was found. Photos reviewed by CBS News depict a disorganized cell with moved items, and inconsistencies between official reports and the visual evidence. Critics contend the scene was not treated as a potential crime scene using standard practices, diminishing the ability to conclusively determine the circumstances of his death and fueling ongoing public speculation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to deploy National Guard troops in Democratic-led cities like Portland and Chicago are facing critical legal tests across the country. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is hearing arguments on lifting a lower court's order blocking deployment in Portland, while a Chicago District Judge is considering halting the National Guard's presence in Illinois. Local governments and former military leaders argue these deployments decrease public safety, exacerbate tensions, and infringe on state sovereignty, blurring the lines between military and civilian rule. These dueling hearings represent high-profile legal battles challenging the President's authority to use federalized troops domestically, with concerns about politicizing the military.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convening his cabinet to discuss a proposed Gaza Strip ceasefire deal, which is widely expected to be approved, signaling a potential end to two years of intense conflict. This agreement, largely based on President Trump's 20-point proposal, entails the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas—both alive and dead—in exchange for an as-yet undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners. Crucially, the Israel Defense Forces will also pull back to a "yellow line" in Gaza, marking the initial phase of a multi-stage withdrawal. This significant development, following intense negotiations in Egypt, anticipates the release of the 20 believed-to-be-alive hostages within 72 hours of the deal's ratification.</p>

          <p>Supermarket chain Publix announced it will permit customers to openly carry firearms inside its Florida stores, a decision that has drawn divided public reactions. This policy change follows a recent appeals court ruling that overturned the state's ban on open carry, granting businesses the choice to allow or prohibit it. While some shoppers express support, feeling a sense of awareness and control, others voice significant safety concerns and anxiety about the presence of visible firearms. Publix stated it will comply with all federal, state, and local laws, emphasizing that any threatening behavior, regardless of firearm presence, will result in law enforcement involvement.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, primarily driven by robust international growth that effectively offset a continued decline in volume within North America. While the company's worldwide volume for both food and drinks collectively fell by 1%, its net sales rose 2.6% to $23.94 billion. PepsiCo is actively addressing softer demand in its home market through increased brand investment, aggressive cost-cutting measures, and the introduction of new "permissible" snack offerings. The company also unveiled new packaging for Lay's and plans for Doritos and Cheetos "NKD" without synthetic dyes, aligning with consumer shifts and regulatory pressures, including those from the Trump administration.

          <p>Donald Trump's announced Gaza peace deal is described as a major human and political moment, sparking widespread relief in Israel and Gaza with the impending release of hostages and a ceasefire. The agreement, though still facing internal Israeli opposition and pending details regarding Palestinian detainees, is seen as a significant breakthrough after two years of devastating conflict. However, this article emphasizes that it is merely a ceasefire, not a comprehensive peace deal, with tough, unresolved issues remaining, such as Hamas disarming, full Israeli troop withdrawal, and the long-term prospect of a Palestinian state. Trump is credited for his unprecedented pressure on allies and enemies, which accelerated momentum towards this critical agreement.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals a surprising and statistically significant 19-point drop in alcohol consumption among Republicans between 2023 and 2025, falling from 65% to 46%, while Democrats and independents saw only single-digit declines. This article explores various theories for this unique shift, including the influence of prominent non-drinking conservative figures like Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, a potential resurgence of Protestant temperance linked to Christian nationalism, and a broader "Make America healthy again" ethos. Young conservatives, particularly men, are noted for their increased health consciousness. Curiously, despite reporting less drinking, Republicans were less likely than other groups to view moderate drinking as dangerous, adding to the anomaly.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that a high-magnitude earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest could trigger a secondary, catastrophic quake on California’s San Andreas fault. Analyzing deep-sea sediment cores, researchers found compelling evidence of 18 synchronized earthquakes over the last 3,000 years, with some ruptures occurring just hours or minutes apart. This suggests that such back-to-back events are not the exception but rather the majority, potentially devastating major cities from San Francisco to Vancouver simultaneously. While the implications are terrifying, the findings offer new insights for improving preparedness, though experts acknowledge that current readiness levels are significantly poor.</p>

          <p>Advocates are urgently calling for a halt to the execution of Robert Roberson in Texas, who would be the first person judicially killed under the widely disputed "shaken baby syndrome" theory. Convicted of shaking his two-year-old daughter to death in 2002, new evidence and expert testimony from 10 medical pathologists now suggest her death was caused by a serious infection and a short fall, not violent abuse. Roberson's legal team also highlights his undiagnosed autism, which may have negatively affected his perceived demeanor at trial. This article details the broad coalition, including lawmakers, the lead detective, and exonerees, arguing that the science behind SBS has been thoroughly discredited, rendering his conviction unsafe and risking a wrongful execution.</p>

While the country has undergone visible superficial changes, such as women driving and increased entertainment options, critics argue the festival serves to whitewash deeper abuses, with performers facing explicit restrictions on criticizing leadership or religion. This article explores the ethical dilemmas for participating comedians, some motivated by substantial payments, others by a belief in fostering gradual liberalization through cultural exchange. Ultimately, the event highlights Saudi Arabia's strategic effort to diversify its economy and improve its international image, even as deep-seated authoritarian controls and human rights concerns persist.</p>

These proposed reforms aim to cut red tape, boost footfall, and support economic growth by making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host more live music. While industry bodies, like UK Hospitality, warmly welcome these changes as a vital step for struggling hospitality businesses facing rising costs, critics, such as the charity Alcohol Change UK, warn that relaxing alcohol rules could lead to increased antisocial behavior, crime, and strain on emergency services.
