        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bryan Kohberger's sentencing hearing provided a platform for victims' families to confront him directly through impact statements. A statement from surviving roommate Bethany Funke, read by a friend, detailed the profound terror and guilt she has experienced since the murders. The family of victim Kaylee Goncalves acknowledged former President Trump's call for Kohberger to explain his motive, emphasizing that a confession without clarity offers no peace. The hearing, described as a "legal funeral," allows for expressions of grief and pain from those affected by the crime.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Securing a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more difficult due to rising interest rates and stricter lender underwriting standards. Experts advise that if an application is denied, borrowers should first ask the lender for the specific reasons, which often relate to high debt-to-income ratios or low credit scores. Proactive steps to improve approval odds include checking credit reports for errors, reducing existing debt, and ensuring a strong overall financial profile. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives like home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans can serve similar purposes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:09:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their original trials rendered the convictions unsafe. Hayes, who spent over five years in jail, described the ordeal as having "destroyed" his family. This ruling vindicates the traders' long-held argument that they were scapegoated to appease public anger over the financial crisis and could open the door for other convicted traders to appeal.</p>

          <p>Amazon is closing its artificial intelligence research lab in Shanghai as part of a broader cost-cutting strategy and in response to ongoing U.S.-China geopolitical tensions. An Amazon Web Services (AWS) spokesperson confirmed the elimination of some roles, following other recent layoffs within the division. The closure reflects a larger trend of American corporations reducing their presence in China due to trade policies and Beijing's push for technological self-sufficiency. This move is the latest in Amazon's retreat from the Chinese market, having previously discontinued its Kindle store and e-commerce marketplace.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes fell by 2.7% in June from the previous month, a larger drop than analysts anticipated, according to the National Association of Realtors. Persistently high mortgage rates are credited with keeping sales activity at cyclical lows. Despite the slowdown in sales, the median home price rose 2% year-over-year to a record high of $435,300, driven by a long-term undersupply of housing. The market remains challenging for first-time buyers, while all-cash deals remained elevated at 29% of transactions. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, Hershey's president stated the company will also focus on developing products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its strategy to become a broader "snacking powerhouse."

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's handling of questions regarding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein appears unconvincing and evasive. The author points to Trump's denial of writing in Epstein's birthday scrapbook, his attempts to kill the story, and his efforts to deflect by attacking political opponents as behavior inconsistent with innocence. The piece suggests that by comparing the Epstein case to other "witch hunts" like the 2020 election investigation, Trump is inadvertently linking himself to matters where his credibility is already questioned. The author concludes that the president's actions seem more indicative of guilt than of a person with nothing to hide.</p>

          <p>Retail traders, largely organizing on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, have targeted GoPro and Krispy Kreme, causing their stock prices to surge dramatically. Shares for the wearable camera maker and the doughnut chain, both of which are relatively low-priced stocks with significant short interest, saw substantial gains in morning trading. This speculative activity follows a pattern seen with other "meme stocks," where online communities coordinate to drive up the value of heavily shorted or undervalued companies. The renewed frenzy coincides with a broader market rally, fueled by relief over recent tariff news and positive economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

An internal investigation reportedly found evidence that Schmidt and Gordon urged employees to slow down operations and defy supervisors. The situation echoes the 2014 employee walkout that paralyzed the company, highlighting ongoing tensions within the Demoulas family-owned business.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Lenin's tomb in Moscow's Red Square is experiencing a new surge of visitors as it prepares to close for repairs until 2027. The mausoleum, which has housed the preserved body of the Soviet Union's founder since his death in 1924, was once a major pilgrimage site but saw interest wane after the USSR's collapse. The upcoming closure has reignited curiosity, drawing lines of tourists and locals for a final look at the historical figure. This renewed attention comes amid years of public debate about whether Lenin's body should finally be buried, making the future of the monument uncertain.</p>

This lack of answers has been a source of anguish for the victims' families, who are expected to deliver impact statements at the hearing.

          <p>Scientists in Barbados have rediscovered the Barbados threadsnake, the world's smallest-known snake, which had not been seen for nearly two decades and was feared extinct. The tiny snake, which can fit on a coin and grows to only four inches, was found under a rock in a small forest. Its rediscovery is considered significant for local conservation efforts, as many of the island's endemic species have already gone extinct. The blind, burrowing snake was first identified as a distinct species in 2008 and is now hoped to become a symbol for protecting the island's remaining unique wildlife habitats.</p>

Speaking as the two powers mark 50 years of diplomatic relations, the chamber president noted that while the partnership has created immense value, intense pressure from Chinese competition is now leading to losses for European companies.

          <p>As many households struggle with rising debt from high inflation and interest rates, financial experts are highlighting several effective debt relief strategies. Methods like the debt avalanche, which prioritizes paying off high-interest debt first, can save significant money over time. For those with multiple debts, consolidation through a personal loan or a balance transfer credit card can simplify payments and lower interest costs. Other options include working with a nonprofit credit counselor on a debt management plan or, in more severe cases, pursuing debt settlement or bankruptcy, though these carry greater risks to one's credit.

The move could increase domestic demand for sugar, further benefiting producers, who are already a powerful lobbying force in Washington. However, the decision has puzzled corn farmers, a key part of Trump's base, as it could negatively impact the market for high-fructose corn syrup, a primary competitor to cane sugar in soft drinks.</p>

Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi sought to clear her name, and after a lengthy campaign, South Korea's top court ordered the retrial.

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Act" introduces significant tax changes, but financial experts suggest its impact on upper-middle-class families is mixed. While an increased standard deduction and an expanded Child Tax Credit may offer some benefits, these are largely offset for many by the continuation of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The law also makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Experts note that for families in high-tax states or those who previously benefited from itemizing deductions, the net effect of the new legislation might not be a significant financial win.

While the president desires reduced borrowing costs, economists warn that forcing the Fed to make politically motivated cuts could backfire by signaling instability to global markets. Such a move could lead investors to demand higher returns on U.S. government bonds to compensate for increased inflation risk, paradoxically driving up long-term interest rates for mortgages and loans.
