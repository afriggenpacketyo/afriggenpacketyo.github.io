          <p>The U.S. administration has formally announced plans to impose steep new tariffs on imports from at least 14 countries, with rates ranging from 25% to 40% set to take effect on August 1. The move, detailed in letters posted to social media, targets nations including Japan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia, escalating global trade tensions and causing U.S. financial markets to decline. The letters state the tariffs are intended to correct trade deficits and warn against retaliatory measures, while also suggesting the rates could be adjusted based on future bilateral relations.

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a significant drop of nearly 7% following CEO Elon Musk's weekend announcement that he has formed a new political party called the 'America Party.' This move comes after a public falling out with President Trump over a major spending bill and has reignited investor concerns about Musk's increasing involvement in politics. Analysts suggest that this political venture is a distraction that shareholders do not want, especially during a precarious time for Tesla, which has recently seen a notable decline in vehicle sales in both the U.S. and Europe.

          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas, which have claimed at least 95 lives, were caused by a confluence of geographical and meteorological factors. The region's topography makes it prone to rapid flooding, and a stalled weather system originating from Tropical Storm Barry dumped an immense amount of rain in a short period. This article details how the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of emergency warnings issued to the public before the catastrophic event unfolded.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city vulnerable to the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is pioneering a 'cool block' project to mitigate extreme temperatures. The initiative involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter, heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white on a single city block. This urban laboratory aims to create a template for other densely populated areas struggling with rising temperatures due to climate change. Researchers are actively studying the project's effectiveness, as such interventions can significantly lower peak temperatures and improve public health during heatwaves.</p>

          <p>This article explains the rules and duration of wage garnishment, a legal process creditors use to collect unpaid debts directly from a person's paycheck. For most consumer debts like credit cards or personal loans, garnishment can continue until the entire debt, including interest and fees, is fully paid, which could take years. Federal law limits the amount that can be taken to 25% of disposable income, but rules differ for debts like federal student loans and taxes. The article outlines potential actions to stop or reduce garnishment, such as challenging it in court, negotiating with the creditor, or filing for bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>A nurse from Houston has shared videos on social media showing the evacuation of young girls from Camp Mystic during the devastating central Texas floods. The footage shows a bus of campers being driven away from the flood-ravaged area, with the girls singing worship songs together in an attempt to remain calm amidst the chaos. The camp was one of the hardest-hit locations, with at least 27 campers and counselors losing their lives. The nurse's posts also included images of the girls enjoying normal camp activities just before the tragedy, offering a chilling and poignant contrast.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes the surge of racist and Islamophobic attacks against Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor. The author argues that the rhetoric, coming from both conservative and some Democratic figures, reflects a political era where hate speech has been normalized, particularly under the influence of Trumpism. The piece contends that Mamdani is a target due to his support for Palestinian rights, which is often conflated with antisemitism, and his Muslim background. The author warns that such open bigotry against a naturalized American citizen sets a dangerous precedent for U.S. politics.</p>

Modrić, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, has had a highly decorated career with the Spanish giants, securing 28 major trophies, including six Champions League titles.

          <p>Tax experts are clarifying that a recent major bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security for most beneficiaries, contrary to a misleading email from the Social Security Administration. The legislation includes a new $6,000 deduction for seniors, but it does not directly change how benefits are taxed. Instead, by lowering adjusted gross income, it may indirectly reduce the tax liability for some middle-income seniors. Experts note the change will not benefit the lowest or highest earners and argue that it will actually weaken Social Security's long-term funding by reducing tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

A limited fleet of cars will operate in the city through the fall, initially with human safety drivers behind the wheel, to collect mapping data and assess the technology's performance in a new urban environment. This expansion, described as a "road trip," is a crucial step for Waymo to gauge the feasibility of launching a paid ride-sharing service in the city.

          <p>This editorial argues that the UK government's upcoming overhaul of special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision must avoid the mistakes made during past welfare reforms. The author stresses the need for a cautious, consultative approach, involving parents and advocacy groups to rebuild trust, which has been eroded by fears of budget-driven cuts. The piece calls for a better understanding of the rising costs and a move toward a more equitable national funding system to replace the current "postcode lottery." It concludes that establishing a cross-party consensus is crucial to avoid politicizing the needs of vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic humorously critiques the media's framing of normal workplace behaviors as alarming new "Gen Z trends." The author recounts a typical workday using exaggerated trend terminology, describing sleep as "Microdeath," commuting without internet as a "Tiny Detox," and chatting with coworkers as "Voice Quitting." The piece cleverly mocks the breathless reporting on phenomena like "quiet quitting" and "micro-retirements," suggesting they are simply new labels for long-standing, mundane aspects of work life. The satire highlights the absurdity of pathologizing routine activities in the modern workplace.</p>

Demonstrators, commemorating the historic "Saba Saba" pro-democracy protests, are now demanding President William Ruto's resignation over corruption, the high cost of living, and police brutality. Authorities barricaded roads in the capital, Nairobi, to block the rallies, leading to clashes where police used tear gas and allegedly live rounds against protesters.

          <p>This analytical article explores the multiple factors that contributed to the extreme death toll in the central Texas floods. While the region is naturally prone to flash floods, the storm's severity was amplified by climate change, which allows for more moisture in the atmosphere and thus heavier rainfall. The piece also examines critical gaps in the disaster warning system, noting that some areas lacked sirens and that text alerts were sent late at night when many were asleep or in unfamiliar areas. It argues that while forecasting has improved, warnings are only effective if people have the tools and knowledge to react appropriately.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has recorded its worst first-half performance since 1973, declining nearly 11% against a basket of global currencies.

The dollar's weakness has benefited U.S. stocks by making exports cheaper, but it has also fueled discussions about a potential decline in its global dominance, as central banks increasingly diversify their reserves by purchasing gold as a safe-haven alternative.
