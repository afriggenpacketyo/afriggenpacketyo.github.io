        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are finding summer profitability more challenging as traditional travel patterns shift, with many travelers now flying earlier in the season or pushing European trips to the fall. This unpredictability, combined with rising labor and operational costs, has forced carriers like American, Delta, and United to reduce their August flight schedules. Consequently, several major airlines have lowered their 2025 profit forecasts, though recent capacity cuts are creating some optimism for a better supply-and-demand balance in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Country music star Luke Bryan has strongly criticized the trend of audience members throwing objects at performers, calling them "idiots" after being hit by a small ball during a recent concert. He expressed frustration not just with the act itself, but also with how the incident was exaggerated, causing unnecessary concern among his family and friends. Bryan noted this is not a new phenomenon, recalling that fans have previously thrown expensive cell phones on stage, which he views as a sign of entitlement.</p>

          <p>The new film 'East of Wall' is a docu-fiction hybrid that explores the lives of a struggling ranch matriarch and her rodeo-star daughter in South Dakota. Directed by Kate Beecroft, the movie features first-time actors playing versions of themselves, lending an authentic grit and warmth to the story of family, financial hardship, and resilience. While the article notes that the film's narrative framework can feel thin at times, it praises the compelling performances of its real-life subjects, Tabatha and Porshia Zimiga, as they navigate their complex world.</p>

While D.C. did experience a crime spike in 2023, making its rates high when compared to states, they were not the highest among major U.S. cities. Crucially, Trump's justification omits that violent crime and homicides in the city have seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025, a trend consistent with national statistics showing a decline in crime across the country.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it will continue to gain strength and potentially become a major hurricane next week. Currently a Category 1 storm located east of the Leeward Islands, Erin is moving west-northwest with sustained winds of 75 mph. While tropical storm watches are in effect for several Caribbean islands, forecast models show the hurricane is expected to curve northward, keeping it offshore and away from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Ahead of his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump has set a firm tone, stating he would "walk" away from the summit if it does not proceed well. In his pre-meeting remarks, Trump emphasized the strength of the U.S. economy and expressed confidence in the talks, while also maintaining a willingness to leave if necessary. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced his hope for a strong American position, asserting that Russia only respects strength and that a lasting peace depends on it.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential government intervention as "essential" for national security. The move is seen as a way to revive the struggling American chipmaker and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, particularly from companies in Taiwan and South Korea. This intervention would align with President Trump's goal of bringing more high-end technology production back to the U.S., though the exact structure of such a deal remains under discussion.</p>

To receive the credit on their loyalty card, shoppers are encouraged to alert staff with a description of the suspect, rather than confronting them directly, as shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have hit a two-decade high.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." The writer explores how Spark uses the story of an unconventional teacher and her favored students in 1930s Edinburgh to delve into the complexities of adolescence, influence, and moral education. The narrative focuses on how the teacher, Miss Brodie, acts as a god-like figure to her pupils, and how one student's eventual conversion to Catholicism represents a final break from that powerful influence, showcasing Spark's deep engagement with themes of faith and individuality.</p>

The list evaluates nine different adaptations, from the 1993 movie "The Pelican Brief" to the new 2025 TV series "The Rainmaker," based on their quality and faithfulness to Grisham's signature style of underdog stories. The author rates "The Pelican Brief" as the best adaptation for its pacing and charismatic leads, while placing the 2012 TV version of "The Firm" at the bottom for failing to capture the propulsive nature of Grisham's writing.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress has introduced a joint resolution seeking to terminate President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police department. Citing the Home Rule Act of 1973, the resolution argues that Trump has not met the "special conditions of an emergency" required to justify such an unprecedented action. The sponsors contend that the president is using misleading crime statistics to rationalize the move, which they describe as one of the most egregious attacks on D.C.'s local governance in decades.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell over 10% after the company provided a disappointing financial outlook for the current quarter. The company forecast adjusted earnings of $2.11 per share on $6.7 billion in revenue, both below analyst expectations. CEO Gary Dickerson attributed the weaker forecast to macroeconomic and policy uncertainties, particularly impacting its business in China, and noted a large backlog of pending export license applications with the U.S. government that it assumes will not be approved soon.

          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 4.0, has occurred in a geothermal steam field in Northern California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area, which is home to one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The earthquakes are believed to be induced by the power generation process, which involves withdrawing steam and injecting cold water, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift, rather than being linked to major fault lines.</p>

          <p>In the days leading up to the summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Russian forces have reportedly breached Ukrainian defensive lines in the Donetsk region. While these advances are currently limited, they represent a potentially dangerous moment for Ukraine and are seen by analysts as a Russian effort to create a favorable narrative ahead of the talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested the offensive is designed to create an information backdrop suggesting Russia is gaining ground, thereby strengthening Putin's negotiating position at the high-stakes meeting in Alaska.</p>

The case, Noem v.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to lay off over 1,400 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which would leave the agency with only about 200 staff members. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit vacates a lower court's injunction that had previously blocked the massive reduction in force. The administration aims for a "more streamlined" bureau, but consumer advocates and the employees' union argue that the cuts would unlawfully dismantle the agency and prevent it from fulfilling its congressionally mandated duties.</p>
