          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 21:51:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least two dozen people were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists visiting Pahalgam, a popular beauty spot in the Himalayas. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah described the attack as the largest directed at civilians in recent years, prompting condemnation from world leaders. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which is unusual given that tourists have rarely been targeted in the region's long-running insurgency. The area has been cordoned off, and a joint search operation by the Indian army and Jammu and Kashmir police is ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campaigners claim that Instagram still poses serious risks to children, even with the introduction of Teen Accounts designed to provide more protection. Researchers were able to create accounts using fake birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. Meta, Instagram's parent company, asserts that these accounts have built-in protections and shares the goal of keeping teens safe online. The research highlights concerns about age verification, content moderation, and the addictive nature of the app, particularly as UK regulators prepare to outline stricter safety rules for online platforms.</p>

          <p>Steve Hilton, former advisor to David Cameron and former Fox News host, has announced his candidacy for California governor in 2026 as a Republican. Hilton is running on a platform of "positive populism" focused on helping working families, addressing high state taxes, and soaring home prices. He criticized state Democrats for what he views as the "destruction of the California dream" and took aim at Kamala Harris, suggesting the governor's job shouldn't be a consolation prize for a failed Washington politician. Hilton's campaign theme is “Golden Again: Great Jobs, Great Homes, Great Kids”.</p>

          <p>With the Real ID deadline less than a month away, many states are not yet fully compliant, potentially causing disruptions at airport security checkpoints. A recent analysis reveals that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect on May 7, 2025. Travelers without a Real ID will be subject to additional screening, which could lead to significant delays. The Real ID Act was passed in 2005 to enhance the security of state-issued identification, and while some states are nearly fully compliant, others are struggling to meet the deadline.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that tariffs on goods from China will be reduced "substantially" following statements from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about a potential "de-escalation" in the trade war. This comes after the US and China imposed tariffs on each other's goods, causing market volatility and concerns about global economic growth. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he would be stepping back from his role at the "department of government efficiency" amid backlash against his White House role. This signals a potential shift in the Trump administration's trade policies and Musk's involvement in government affairs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's energy-storage industry faces a challenging year due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. With exports to the US likely to be affected by higher tariffs, producers are projected to cut capital expenditure, potentially shrinking the annual expansion of battery energy-storage systems. The sector is also dealing with a relentless price war resulting from overproduction, which has caused export prices to slump. Producers will need to focus on cultivating non-US markets to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>While China grapples with declining birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, stands out for its relatively high birth rate, driven by cultural traditions that value larger households and ancestral lineage. The province recorded over a million births in 2024, making it the top province for new births for the seventh consecutive year. This trend is attributed to the strong belief that more children bring more blessings and that sons carry on the family name. Guangdong's economic prosperity also contributes to its higher birth rate compared to the national average.</p>
