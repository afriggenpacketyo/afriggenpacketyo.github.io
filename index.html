          <p>The United Kingdom experienced its hottest start to May on record, with temperatures soaring to 28C (82.4F) in London, surpassing the previous high of 27.4C set in Scotland in 1990. This unseasonably warm weather was attributed to a blocked area of high pressure over the UK, resulting in a sustained south-easterly air flow that brought warm conditions across much of the country. While Scotland and Northern Ireland experienced cooler temperatures, the majority of the UK enjoyed heat well above the average for this time of year. Optimism score is based on the fact that this is a weather related event. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors highlight a lesser-known 401(k) feature that can significantly increase retirement savings by allowing after-tax contributions beyond the standard deferral limits, with the potential for tax-free growth through Roth conversions. While the maximum 401(k) limit for 2025 is $70,000, including employee deferrals, after-tax contributions, company matches, and profit sharing, only a small percentage of employer plans offer this option, and even fewer investors take advantage of it. The article emphasizes the importance of periodically converting after-tax funds to Roth to maximize tax benefits and recommends focusing on regular 401(k) deferrals first.

They argue that the tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace income taxes and that such a move would disproportionately affect low- and middle-income households. Experts also note that relying on tariffs to replace income taxes would require significantly higher tariffs, which could risk a U.S. recession.</p>
