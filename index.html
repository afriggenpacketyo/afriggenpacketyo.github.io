          <p>A family in South London is living in fear after their neighbor allegedly threatened the father with a knife and damaged their property, including smashing a car windscreen with a hammer. The family feels the housing association, Wandle, has failed to take adequate action to safeguard them, despite the incidents being recorded. The housing association claims to be working with the police, local authority, and mental health services to resolve the situation, while also assessing the property for enhanced security. Exclusive data shows complaints about anti-social behavior dealt with by social landlords in England have increased by 119% over four years, suggesting a broader systemic issue.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for international collaboration on trade, despite increasing tariffs and other barriers, during a speech at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against turning trade into a political or security issue. Li highlighted the importance of engaging in the international economy to reshape global rules and order, urging countries to stay on the "right" path. Adam Tooze, a history professor at Columbia University, interpreted Li's comments as a call for a pluralization of global rules and processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's governing doctrine of unpredictability, characterized by volatile inconsistency, is poorly suited to international affairs, according to this opinion piece. Foreign leaders, unlike White House courtiers, have competing national interests and are not easily swayed by Trump's coercive control methods. This tension is palpable at the NATO summit, where European leaders strive to keep Trump onside while planning for the possibility of him abandoning the alliance. Trump's actions regarding Iran and Ukraine are driven by pettier motives, such as undermining Joe Biden's policies and seeking easy wins rather than considering complex consequences.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the NATO Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, displaying a surprisingly cordial tone towards the alliance he has previously criticized. He met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and other world leaders, and also greeted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Rutte congratulated Trump for securing increased defense spending commitments from European members and brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Despite the progress, Trump cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to NATO's mutual defense clause, while U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker reassured allies of continued U.S. support.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that an interconnected global solar-wind energy system could meet the world’s energy demands by 2050, producing three times the needed power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The research explores creating a network that utilizes regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents to areas with high demand. The study acknowledges the need to navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises to establish such a system, but emphasizes that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency and resilience against conflict and climate extremes. The researchers highlight that the potential of solar and wind resources vastly surpasses human demand.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded the race. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with younger voters and on social media, capitalizing on a progressive, economy-focused platform. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 after sexual harassment allegations, campaigned on his experience and past confrontations with Donald Trump. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent in the fall.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being warned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after Apricity Fertility, a popular online firm, went bust, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These clinics act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors, but the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), lacks the power to regulate them. The HFEA is calling for strengthened laws to protect patients, highlighting the risks involved when these clinics close without ensuring continuity of care or refunds. Patients like Syreeta Sandhu and Beth Rodgers have lost significant amounts of money and time due to the collapse of such clinics.</p>

The ABC argued her post breached its editorial policy, but the court found she was sacked for her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.

          <p>California leaders have tentatively agreed on a $321-billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal reflects resistance to Governor Newsom's proposed cuts to reduce a $12-billion budget deficit, with the Legislature opting to borrow money, tap into state reserves, and shift funding. The agreement includes a "poison pill" requiring legislators to pass a proposal that lessens the number of building projects requiring a full environmental review under CEQA. The budget also involves changes to Medi-Cal funding and relies on shifting money around to address the deficit.</p>

          <p>A preliminary US intelligence assessment reportedly found that US strikes on Iran's key nuclear facilities have only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months. The assessment, according to Reuters, indicates that Tehran would be able to restart its nuclear program in months. This assessment is at odds with President Donald Trump's assertions that the US strikes "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment "flat-out wrong," maintaining that the strikes resulted in "total obliteration."</p>

          <p>Michael Conforto had a strong performance in the Dodgers' 9-7 win against the Rockies, going two for five with a double and a home run. This marked his first multi-hit effort since May 27 and his first game with multiple extra-base hits this season. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged that Conforto faces a "critical" upcoming month, which could influence the Dodgers' roster construction for the second half of the season. The Dodgers have remained reluctant to shop for a potential replacement ahead of the trade deadline, hoping Conforto can improve his performance.</p>

          <p>China is expanding ways for foreign institutions to use the yuan as international confidence in the U.S. dollar declines. These efforts aim to challenge the dollar's dominance, with the People's Bank of China discussing how to lessen reliance on a single sovereign currency. Recent moves include setting up a center for digital yuan internationalization and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Despite these initiatives, some analysts note that China's strict capital controls and geopolitical risks may hinder large-scale adoption of the yuan.</p>

Cuomo, the former governor, was attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, secured a commanding lead, although falling short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright. Cuomo's concession was unexpected given the ranked-choice system in place, and Mamdani would be the first Muslim and Indian American to lead New York City if elected.</p>
