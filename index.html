Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both saw declines, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged slightly higher. The market is also reacting to new U.S. tariffs on Indian goods and digesting Nvidia's latest earnings report, which beat expectations but saw data center revenue fall short of estimates. This combination of geopolitical and corporate factors contributed to a cautious trading session across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, was a former student at the attached school and died by suicide at the scene. Authorities are investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, having recovered a video manifesto posted by the shooter that contained disturbing writings.

          <p>Susan Monarez has been ousted as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just weeks after her Senate confirmation. Her departure coincides with the resignations of at least three other top CDC officials, who cited the dangerous politicization of science and an inability to protect public health under the current administration. Monarez's lawyers stated she was targeted for refusing to approve "unscientific, reckless directives," highlighting a period of significant upheaval and low morale at the nation's top public health agency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn that Southern California and the Central Valley are increasingly vulnerable to massive dust storms, known as haboobs, due to factors exacerbated by climate change. Conditions like drought, water overuse, and wildfires create dry soil that can be swept up into towering walls of dust, similar to a recent event in Phoenix. These storms pose serious health risks by carrying toxic materials, including pesticides and fungal spores, which can worsen respiratory conditions like asthma. Researchers note that dust levels in recent history are already six times higher than in the last 5,000 years.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has suspended more than 20 employees who publicly signed an open letter to Congress. The letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," was signed by 191 current and former employees and argued that Trump administration policies were dismantling progress made since Hurricane Katrina. The signatories criticized the appointment of unqualified leaders and cuts to the agency's workforce and grants. FEMA responded by calling the signatories "entrenched bureaucrats" who were resistant to necessary reforms.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's humiliating Carabao Cup elimination by fourth-tier Grimsby Town has placed intense pressure on manager Ruben Amorim. The defeat comes after a dismal 15th-place league finish last season, despite the club investing £200 million in new attacking players over the summer. Amorim's tactical system and handling of players like Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho are under scrutiny from the club's new leadership. The loss has amplified concerns about the team's direction and whether Amorim is the right person to lead a recovery.</p>

          <p>Working parents in England with children aged nine months to three years will soon be eligible for 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week during term time. This expansion is the final phase of a government plan, but it faces challenges, including concerns about a shortage of staff and available places. While the program aims to reduce costs for families, many childcare providers argue that government funding rates are insufficient, forcing them to charge for extras like meals and supplies, which can make the "free" hours unaffordable for some parents.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel quickly reversed its decision to adopt a new, minimalist logo after facing a significant right-wing backlash, but the controversy reveals deeper truths about the brand. The article argues that Cracker Barrel has always presented a corporate-owned simulation of rural Southern life, capitalizing on nostalgia for a disappearing culture while contributing to its decline through highway-centric, chain-based business models. The failed rebrand was not a sign of "wokeness," but another attempt at corporate sanitization that clashed with the carefully cultivated, albeit manufactured, identity its customers value.</p>

The recurring threat of wildfires and smoke taint is creating an existential crisis for vintners, who face devastating financial losses.

UK retailers are urging the government to close this loophole, arguing it creates unfair competition that undercuts High Street businesses.

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report alleging that Americans were conducting covert operations in Greenland. The alleged aim was to infiltrate Greenlandic society and promote its secession from Denmark to the United States. The incident escalates tensions over the semi-autonomous territory, which President Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to annex. Danish intelligence services have warned that foreign actors are attempting to create discord in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump took to social media to criticize NBC for extending its contract with "Late Night" host Seth Meyers, calling him one of the "least talented" hosts on television. The post referenced a contract extension through 2028 that was publicly announced in May 2024. The article notes the long-standing animosity between Trump and Meyers, which dates back to Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. This continues a pattern of the president targeting late-night hosts who are frequent critics of his administration.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Conservative party is facing a potential existential crisis as it consistently trails Reform UK in opinion polls and loses elected officials to rivals. The recent defection of a third Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to Reform highlights a significant challenge for leader Russell Findlay. The party is struggling to counter Reform's right-wing appeal without alienating the moderate, center-right voters it gained under previous leadership. This political fracturing could reshape the landscape at Holyrood ahead of next year's election.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with a sales growth forecast that also came in above estimates. Despite the strong performance, the company's stock fell in extended trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, came in slightly below analyst projections for the second consecutive quarter. The results confirm that demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure remains robust, with the company expecting between $3 and $4 trillion in AI-related spending by the end of the decade.
