          <p>Epping Forest District Council successfully obtained a High Court injunction to remove asylum seekers from The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, by September 12. The ruling follows weeks of protests, some turning violent, after an asylum seeker residing there was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. The Home Office had warned that such a decision would significantly impact its ability to house asylum seekers nationally.
