          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea for the murder of four University of Idaho students, prosecutors are requesting a 99-year extension of the no-contact order preventing him from contacting the victims' families. The current order is set to expire in 2027, and this motion seeks to prolong it well beyond Kohberger's expected sentence of four consecutive life terms. Kohberger pleaded guilty to the November 2022 stabbing deaths to avoid a potential death penalty, leaving behind his DNA on a knife sheath at the crime scene. The families will have the opportunity to deliver victim impact statements at his upcoming sentencing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump recently held an hour-long private meeting with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the White House. The discussion comes amid a shifting relationship between the two, who were often at odds during Trump's first term. In his second term, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve relations, especially as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. The meeting signals a potential alignment of interests, particularly as the administration focuses on domestic manufacturing and technology, while Bezos navigates the political landscape to benefit his business ventures.</p>

          <h2>United States Withdraws from UNESCO for a Second Time Under Trump Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 17:10:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the second time. The State Department cited the agency's promotion of "divisive social and cultural causes" and its "globalist, ideological agenda" as being contrary to the administration's "America First" foreign policy. The U.S. also reiterated its long-standing objections to UNESCO's 2011 admission of Palestine as a full member state. This move reverses the Biden administration's 2023 decision to rejoin the organization, with the withdrawal set to take effect at the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that artificial intelligence will lead to the complete disappearance of certain job categories, specifically highlighting customer support roles as an example. He argued that AI can now handle customer service inquiries more efficiently and accurately than humans. While also claiming AI's diagnostic abilities can surpass those of human doctors, he expressed personal reluctance to entrust his health solely to an AI without human oversight. Altman's comments were made as the Trump administration unveiled its own AI action plan, focusing on deregulation and promoting data center development.</p>

This income-driven plan will offer loan forgiveness after 30 years, a longer timeline than existing options. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP will become one of only two choices for new borrowers, alongside a standard 10-to-25-year fixed payment plan.</p>

          <p>The federal government has released a massive trove of documents, totaling over 230,000 pages, related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The release, ordered by President Trump, includes FBI files on potential leads, internal memos, and CIA records concerning the search for convicted assassin James Earl Ray. While the Director of National Intelligence touted the release as a step toward transparency, King's living children urged the public to engage with the files with empathy. They warned against using the records, many of which stem from the FBI's controversial surveillance of their father, to attack his legacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives will begin its summer recess a day earlier than planned, a move Democrats claim is a tactic by the Republican majority to avoid difficult votes. Democrats have been persistent in their efforts to force a vote on compelling the release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Republican leadership has downplayed the schedule change, while Speaker Mike Johnson argued that a rush to release documents could retraumatize victims. The early adjournment highlights the intense political turmoil and partisan infighting surrounding the handling of the sensitive Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. auto industry is feeling significant financial pressure from tariffs, with major manufacturers absorbing the costs rather than passing them on to consumers. General Motors reported a $1.1 billion quarterly hit to its profits, while Stellantis, which owns Chrysler and Jeep, reported paying nearly $400 million in tariffs. This trend suggests that carmakers are sacrificing profitability to maintain competitive pricing in a market where consumers are already wary of high vehicle costs. The ongoing tariff uncertainty poses a major challenge to the financial health of the automotive sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The H20 chip was specifically designed to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions. The reversal of the ban was reportedly part of a broader trade deal negotiated in June, where the U.S. eased some tech export controls in exchange for access to Chinese rare earth minerals.
