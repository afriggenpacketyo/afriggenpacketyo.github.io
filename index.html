          <p>A Bangladeshi air force training jet crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, resulting in at least 27 fatalities and over 170 injuries. The F-7 aircraft reportedly experienced a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff, with the pilot among those killed. Eyewitnesses, including students, described the horrific scene of the plane hitting a building and killing people instantly, including a student's best friend and parents waiting to pick up their children. The interim government has declared a national day of mourning for the victims, many of whom were minors aged 9 to 14 being treated for severe burns in local hospitals.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old Brooklyn man has been arrested and charged with arson for allegedly setting fire to eleven New York Police Department vehicles in June. The suspect, who has a history of arrests at pro-Palestinian protests, pleaded not guilty to the federal charges. According to the criminal complaint, surveillance footage captured the man scaling a fence into an NYPD reserve lot, and his fingerprints were found on a lighter at the scene. The estimated replacement cost for the destroyed vehicles is $800,000, and officials have emphasized that setting police vehicles ablaze is a federal crime, not a form of protest.</p>

          <p>A London court case has detailed the brutal murders of Albert Alfonso, 62, and Paul Longworth, 71, by Yostin Mosquera, 35. The trial revealed a complex relationship rooted in paid, extreme sexual content, with Alfonso sending Mosquera thousands of pounds over several years. Mosquera claimed he was sexually assaulted daily during a prior visit and was unaware Alfonso was sharing videos of him online. Prosecutors showed that Mosquera planned the murders, searching for poisons and a freezer before killing both men, dismembering their bodies, and attempting to steal thousands of pounds from their accounts.</p>

          <p>Malcolm-Jamal Warner, the actor celebrated for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54 in an accidental drowning in Costa Rica. Officials reported that Warner was swimming at a beach on the country's Caribbean coast when he was apparently pulled out to sea by a current. Despite assistance from bystanders and paramedics, he was declared dead at the scene. Warner's career extended well beyond his iconic 1980s role, including numerous television shows, directing credits, and a 2015 Grammy Award for his musical work, leaving a significant legacy in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>The Ryde Hotel, a historic landmark in the California Delta, has reported the theft of a large portion of its resident peacock flock. Staff discovered only four of the several dozen birds remained after a guest witnessed two men forcing a peacock into a cage. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a felony, valuing the birds at thousands of dollars. Hotel staff and local authorities are concerned the peacocks may have been stolen for the black market exotic animal trade or for their meat, a devastating blow to the community and the hotel, where the birds were a cherished feature.</p>

          <p>National Archives documents reveal that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing during their time in Downing Street. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair acquired over £75,000 worth of clothes for just £31,000, raising concerns among officials about potential conflicts under the ministerial code. Memos show officials advised the Blairs to repay some of the discount to avoid negative public perception, though it is unclear if this occurred. The arrangements, negotiated by a personal shopper, were intended to be kept confidential to avoid scrutiny.</p>

          <p>An analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has increased by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. This surge is attributed to high demand from tenants coupled with a shortage of available rental properties. The rising costs are forcing some individuals to turn down job opportunities or relocate, while some parents are providing financial assistance to their adult children to cover living expenses. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, more affordable areas are now experiencing sharp rises in rental prices.</p>

The man had accompanied his wife to her appointment and was reportedly invited into the scan room by the technician to assist her, without being warned about the danger of metal objects. The powerful magnetic field pulled the man into the machine by a chain he was wearing, and he remained stuck for nearly an hour before being freed.

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India crash that killed 260 people has sparked controversy and speculation regarding the pilots' final moments. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he activated the fuel "cut-off" switches seconds after takeoff, a move that caused total power loss. Investigators and pilot associations have condemned speculative media reports that have attempted to assign blame before the full investigation is complete. While evidence suggests the switches were moved manually, the full context remains unknown, leaving open questions about deliberate action, pilot confusion, or a potential aircraft malfunction.</p>

The pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred movement toward removing these domestic barriers, which could unlock significant economic potential. For example, the piece notes China's push for a 'unified domestic market' and a major EU report on competitiveness as signs that nations are being prompted to reform their own protectionist policies in response to the external tariff threat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 200,000 pages of FBI records related to the surveillance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from his family. King's children stated the files must be viewed in the context of the FBI's historical campaign to discredit their father and the Civil Rights Movement. They also reiterated their belief that he was killed as part of a government conspiracy. The release follows a presidential directive to declassify records on several major assassinations and comes as critics accuse the administration of using the disclosure to distract from public pressure to release files on Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—as companies that have been heavily favored by retail investors and are poised for continued growth. He noted that these names, which he dubbed "PARC," are emblematic of a market where a handful of trendy stocks can rally relentlessly, often detached from traditional metrics. Cramer suggested that while these stocks are volatile, they are backed by solid earnings and analyst attention, distinguishing them from more speculative plays. He advised that investors can profit from these names but should exercise discipline by taking gains when they occur. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth's rotation is accelerating, causing days to become marginally shorter. This trend, driven by factors like the moon's gravity and changes in the planet's liquid core, could force timekeepers to take an unprecedented step: subtracting a second from the global clock. Since 1972, 27 "leap seconds" have been added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to account for a slower rotation, but none have ever been removed. The prospect of a "negative leap second" raises concerns for computer systems and telecommunications networks, as the process has never been tested on a global scale.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of how the Trump administration is using the judicial system and executive orders to advance its agenda, creating an unprecedented level of conflict with the courts. Through a combination of appointing conservative judges, challenging judicial authority with aggressive rhetoric, and leveraging recent Supreme Court rulings that limit injunctions against presidential policies, the administration is actively reshaping the balance of power. Retired and active judges have expressed alarm at the scale of the confrontation, which they say threatens the independence of the judiciary and the foundational system of checks and balances in U.S. government.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has filed a complaint asking the Justice Department to investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges the university systematically uses race and identity-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby violating federal civil rights law and the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. The group is demanding an end to these programs and a suspension of federal funding. This action represents a significant escalation in the conservative legal movement's campaign against diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in higher education.</p>

          <p>A former Kentucky police officer, Brett Hankison, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Hankison, the only officer charged in connection with the raid itself, was convicted of using excessive force for blindly firing ten shots into her apartment. The sentence was delivered despite a controversial recommendation from the Trump-led Justice Department for only one day of prison time. Taylor's family expressed that while the sentence was not what they hoped for, it was a small piece of justice.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced that its long-standing open seating policy will end, with assigned seating set to begin on flights from January 27, 2026. Customers will be able to book these flights starting July 29 of this year. This major shift abandons the carrier's iconic first-come, first-served boarding process in favor of a more traditional model that allows passengers to select their seats in advance. The new system will include options for extra legroom seats and a revamped boarding process with eight numbered groups, marking a significant change in the airline's strategy to generate new revenue.</p>
