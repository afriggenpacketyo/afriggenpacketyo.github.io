The suspect also allegedly shot and wounded Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.  Boelter's motives remain unclear, but his actions are considered politically motivated.</p>

          <p>President Trump's much-anticipated military parade, celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary, proved underwhelming for many.  The event was overshadowed by recent news events, including protests against ICE raids and the Israel-Iran conflict.  While some attendees expressed support for Trump, others criticized the parade's cost and perceived political nature.  The event was described as less than well-organized, with logistical issues and a smaller-than-expected crowd.</p>
