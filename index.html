          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming book, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris reflects critically on former President Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election. She writes that leaving the choice to "an individual's ego" was reckless given the high stakes, though she acknowledges she was in a poor position to advise him against it. Harris also claims that Biden's inner circle was unsupportive and sometimes fueled negative narratives about her. The book offers a candid look into the internal dynamics of the previous administration.</p>

          <p>With students now having no living memory of the September 11, 2001 attacks, teachers across the U.S. are developing new ways to educate them about the event's significance. Programs, such as one at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York, connect educators with survivors and first responders to provide firsthand accounts. These teachers aim to convey not only the trauma of the day but also the sense of national unity and resilience that followed. The goal is to ensure the historical and emotional weight of 9/11 is understood by future generations.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken provides five practical, science-backed strategies for managing stress, emphasizing that the stress hormone cortisol is a natural part of life that needs balance, not elimination. The recommendations include reframing one's mindset to stop worrying about being stressed and accepting it as a normal response. Other key tips are engaging in regular physical exercise to help the body manage cortisol spikes, prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule, and focusing on self-care through good nutrition and carving out personal time.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has prompted a rare moment of bipartisan unity, with political leaders from both parties condemning the act. President Trump, who announced Kirk's death, ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. Former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, along with other prominent Democrats and Republicans, issued statements decrying political violence and expressing condolences to Kirk's family. The widespread reaction underscores the shock and concern over the violent nature of the attack in the current political climate.</p>

Unlike the lengthy and regulated production process of television, social media creators can respond instantly to trends, as exemplified by the "cronut" craze.

          <p>A BBC Eye investigation reveals that the international charity SOS Children's Villages International was allegedly involved in the disappearance of children of detained parents during Syria's civil war. The investigation, based on leaked documents and whistleblower testimony, found that the charity's Syrian branch, which had ties to the Assad regime, held children in orphanages instead of reuniting them with relatives. The charity is accused of complying with intelligence agency orders, changing children's identities, and preventing contact with families, complicating efforts to find over 3,700 missing children since the regime's fall.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer observes that the current market environment is reminiscent of the show's early days in the 1990s. He recalls a time when more investors were excited about individual stocks, a sentiment he believes is returning after years dominated by index fund investing. Cramer credits the show with "democratizing" market information for the public. He suggests that with the significant gains seen in major individual stocks today, the focus is rightly shifting back to the rewards of single stock ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the gap between the two nations has closed significantly since 2020. He advocated for a strategy of exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks"—which include chips, algorithms, and applications—to allies. This approach is intended to prevent China from gaining global market share and to strengthen the American AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Uber by a 23-year-old woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted after her driver abandoned her in an unsafe neighborhood. The woman claims that after she vomited in the vehicle, the driver kicked her out eight miles from her destination without her phone or keys. She was then approached by two individuals who offered help but instead took her to an apartment where she was sexually assaulted at knifepoint. The lawsuit accuses Uber of failing in its duty of care by abandoning a vulnerable passenger.</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Harry Brook, described the rain-shortened T20 match against South Africa in Cardiff as a "shambles." The game, which was delayed and then interrupted again by rain, was ultimately reduced to a nine-over innings for South Africa and a revised five-over chase for England. England fell short of the adjusted target, losing the opening match of the series. Brook felt that little could be learned from such a disjointed contest, stating that it's difficult to properly execute with the bat in just five overs.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. Researchers hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' "dark DNA"—the vast, non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. These spiders have three times more dark DNA than humans, and it is believed this genetic material could enable them to adapt and evolve into new species with unique colors and mating dances more rapidly. This research could provide broader insights into how variation arises in the natural world.</p>

Despite his frequent and sharp criticism of the political right, Kimmel expressed sympathy for Kirk's family and all victims of senseless gun violence.

          <p>The U.S. House passed a bipartisan measure to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force in Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The vote, supported by 212 Democrats and 49 Republicans, represents a significant effort by Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Lawmakers argued that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military action without new congressional approval. The amendment is attached to the annual defense spending bill and reflects a long-standing debate over presidential war powers.</p>
