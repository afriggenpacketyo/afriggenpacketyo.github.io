          <p>Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase has been placed on non-disciplinary paid leave until August 31st amid a Major League Baseball investigation into sports betting. This action is part of a broader probe that previously saw another Guardians pitcher, Luis Ortiz, put on leave. The team and MLB have stated they will not comment further until the investigation is complete, though they have confirmed no other personnel are expected to be impacted. Clase, a three-time All-Star, has been a key player for Cleveland, leading the league in games finished for the past three seasons.</p>

          <p>A Cardiff couple, Stuart Compton and Tracy Turner, have been sentenced for planning brutal sexual offenses against three children. Compton received a life sentence with a minimum of seven years, while Turner, a hospital worker, was sentenced to 12 years. The court heard they exchanged approximately 100,000 messages, referring to themselves as "Bonnie and Clyde," detailing plans to sexually assault and abuse the children, who were under 13. Although no physical contact was made, the judge determined their plans were not mere fantasy and had devastated the victims' families.</p>

          <h2>UK Hospitals Face Patient Safety Concerns Amid Record Requests for Striking Doctors to Return</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 14:01:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a five-day walkout by resident doctors in the UK, hospitals have made a record number of requests for them to return to work due to patient safety fears. Of the 58 "derogation" requests submitted to the British Medical Association (BMA), a record eight have been approved so far. The BMA, which is demanding a 29% pay raise to counteract years of pay erosion, claims some trusts planned inadequately for the strike by scheduling elective procedures. This has led to disputes over the appropriateness of the requests, with the union asserting that poor planning by hospitals has risked patient safety.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is proceeding with a plan to incinerate a $9.7 million stockpile of contraceptives, including IUDs and implants, originally intended for humanitarian aid in low-income countries. This decision follows the dismantling of USAID and a freeze on foreign aid under the Trump administration. Humanitarian groups like Doctors Without Borders and UNFPA offered to purchase the supplies but were rejected, with the government citing the "Mexico City Policy," which restricts funding for organizations involved with abortion services. Critics, including lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe, argue the products are essential for preventing unintended pregnancies and are not abortifacients.</p>

          <p>A shooting in Atlanta's Sweet Auburn neighborhood early Monday resulted in one death and ten injuries among a group of young adults aged 18 to 29. The incident, which police believe stemmed from a parking dispute, was part of a violent weekend in the city that saw 29 people injured and two killed across 12 separate incidents. Authorities are searching for three men and one woman in connection with the shooting and have recovered firearms and 34 shell casings from the scene. Despite this recent spike in violence, both the mayor and police chief noted an overall downward trend in homicides for the year.</p>

Harper allegedly told the commissioner to leave the clubhouse, leading to a tense exchange before other players intervened. While the two later shook hands, the incident highlights the growing friction between players and owners as the current collective bargaining agreement's 2026 expiration date approaches.</p>

          <p>For the first time, two prominent Israeli human rights groups, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, have accused their own country of committing genocide in Gaza.

This move shatters a significant taboo within Israel, where such allegations are often dismissed as antisemitic. While the groups are on the political fringe in Israel, their claims add a new, internal dimension to the international legal debate surrounding the war.</p>

The UK faces a lower baseline tariff of 10%, potentially giving its firms a competitive pricing advantage over EU counterparts in the US market. However, the comparison is complex due to specific quotas and exceptions, such as the UK's 100,000-vehicle annual limit for its lower auto tariff. Uncertainty also remains regarding how pharmaceuticals and steel will be treated under the EU deal, which could affect any potential advantage for UK exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

Filing for bankruptcy can severely damage one's credit score for up to a decade, making future borrowing difficult and expensive. Depending on the type of filing, individuals could also be forced to liquidate valuable assets, such as property or investments, to repay creditors. Finally, a bankruptcy filing is a public record that can create long-term personal and professional obstacles with landlords, employers, and insurers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's lawyers are asking a federal judge to compel Rupert Murdoch to be deposed within 15 days for a $10 billion defamation lawsuit. The lawsuit concerns a Wall Street Journal article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. The motion for an expedited deposition cites Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health scares, arguing he may be unavailable to testify in person by the time the case goes to trial. Trump's team also seeks related documents, including text messages and call logs, from the media mogul, who opposes the request for an accelerated timeline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue Medicaid reimbursements for all Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling expands a previous, more limited injunction and blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting its Medicaid payments for one year. In her order, the judge noted that restricting services would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing the funding would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics, affecting over a million patients.</p>

With average rates for both products now sitting around 8.25%, prospective borrowers should act strategically. This article advises homeowners to carefully compare the two products, as HELOCs are variable-rate credit lines while home equity loans are fixed-rate lump sums. It also recommends getting quotes from multiple lenders and precisely determining borrowing needs to avoid taking on unnecessary risk with their home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

The Seed Sounds Weekender, taking place in September, will feature events at over 1,000 pubs and bars, which Healy describes as the "foundation of any real culture." He argues that without these "seed" venues, where iconic acts like Amy Winehouse and The Smiths got their start, new talent cannot emerge. The festival aims to highlight the vital role these small stages play amid unprecedented economic challenges facing the hospitality sector.</p>

A tribunal determined that Harrison, 35, encouraged a "vulnerable" young pupil to perform a sex act on him and touched her inappropriately in February 2019. The panel noted Harrison's "complete lack of insight and remorse" and the "devastating" impact of his actions on the pupil and her family.

          <p>With growing evidence linking high red meat consumption to health risks like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, experts are highlighting alternative sources of iron. This is crucial as many Americans may have an undiagnosed iron deficiency.

They also note that fortified breads and cereals are a major source of iron in the U.S. diet. For plant-based sources, it is recommended to pair them with vitamin C-rich foods to enhance the body's absorption of the essential mineral.</p>
