          <p>Temu and Shein face new trade challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a tariff loophole and increased duties on Chinese imports. Despite these hurdles, experts believe they will remain competitive by accelerating localization strategies, onboarding American sellers, and utilizing local warehouses. Temu has already shifted to exclusively offering goods shipped from U.S. warehouses, while Shein is expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey and Mexico. While prices have risen, experts are confident that both companies will continue to offer competitive prices due to their agile supply chains and ability to operate on thin margins.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a significant increase after the company reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, maintaining its full-year guidance despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties. Revenues decreased by 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, slightly surpassing analysts' forecasts. The company cited weaker sales in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to subdued consumer demand. Despite these challenges, Hugo Boss confirmed its 2025 outlook, projecting full-year sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros, while closely monitoring economic developments and trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has proposed a 100% tariff on all films entering the U.S. that are produced in foreign countries, citing concerns over the decline of the American film industry and incentives offered by other nations. He views this as a matter of national security, framing foreign films as "messaging and propaganda." While the implementation details remain unclear, such a tariff could significantly impact international productions and potentially shift filming locations back to the U.S. However, it's noted that U.S.-produced films already dominate the domestic market.</p>

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito, 91, has been admitted to a Tokyo hospital for a medical examination after a checkup revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. He will undergo a series of tests at the University of Tokyo Hospital, although he has not reported any symptoms. Akihito's last hospitalization was in 2012 for coronary-artery bypass surgery, and he received treatment for heart failure in 2022. He abdicated the throne in April 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to do so in about 200 years.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China raises questions about the competence and reliability of his commanders, potentially impacting his appetite for war with Taiwan. Over the past two years, numerous high-ranking officers have been removed, including leaders of the Rocket Force, which controls China's nuclear weapons. While the reasons for these dismissals are unclear, the internal turmoil suggests that Xi may not have a solid grip on the army, which could offer Taiwan and the United States time to strengthen their defenses. This article posits that hardware and logistics alone donâ€™t ensure victory.</p>

          <p>There's a shift occurring in China as the children of senior officials are increasingly choosing to follow their parents into the public sector. This trend reverses the previous norm where they sought lucrative opportunities in the private sector. The Communist Party's anti-corruption drive and a slowing economy are driving this change, making government jobs more appealing due to their security and stability. This has resulted in government agencies now employing more individuals from privileged backgrounds.</p>
