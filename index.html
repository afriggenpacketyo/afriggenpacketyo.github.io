          <p>Elon Musk has publicly condemned President Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on X. Musk argues that the bill will drastically increase the federal budget deficit to $2.5 trillion, burdening American citizens with unsustainable debt. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, downplayed Musk's criticism, stating that President Trump is aware of Musk's stance and remains committed to the bill. The article highlights the breaking nature of this news and invites readers to refresh for updates, emphasizing the tension between a prominent tech figure and the administration. The criticism from Musk, who previously supported Trump, adds a layer of complexity to the political landscape, with potential implications for future policy decisions. The optimism score is neutral, reflecting the lack of a clear positive or negative outcome from the situation.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the United States, which the Justice Department classifies as a potential agroterrorism weapon. The pair were allegedly funded by the Chinese government for their research, some of which was conducted at the University of Michigan. Officials claim Jian has ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and Liu admitted to hiding the fungus in his luggage to conduct research at the university. The FBI notes that the fungus causes "head blight," a disease affecting wheat, barley, maize, and rice, leading to billions of dollars in economic losses annually. The severity of the charges reflects national security concerns and the potential threat to American agriculture.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy legislation, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is facing criticism for potentially rolling back the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill, which has cleared the House and is moving to the Senate, could cause millions of Americans to lose Medicaid coverage and health insurance. Critics argue that the bill is essentially an attempt to repeal parts of the ACA under the guise of reducing waste and fraud. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034, with the impact potentially worsening if Congress does not extend premium subsidies for Obamacare plans.

          <p>The White House is attributing a recent terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, to the Biden administration's immigration policies. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, entered the U.S. under the Biden administration and overstayed his visa. Leavitt criticized the administration for allowing Soliman to stay and work in the country instead of deporting him. The statement echoes past warnings from President Trump about the consequences of lenient immigration policies. The political implications of this blame game could intensify debates over border security and immigration reform.</p>

Israel has denied targeting civilians, stating that soldiers fired warning shots and opened fire on "several suspects."

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits in the U.S., potentially altering longstanding immigration policy. The proposed rule would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe that would be difficult to meet given current backlogs. Advocates argue that this change could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, pushing them into the underground economy. The Department of Homeland Security has not commented on the proposal, but emphasized its commitment to protecting national security and increasing program integrity.</p>

Home Office figures indicate a peak in "red days," when conditions are suitable for crossings, and a rise in overcrowded boats. Critics argue that the government is deflecting blame for the issue, while the government insists it is working to fix a broken asylum system. Experts suggest that while weather is a factor, the effectiveness of smuggling gangs and the number of people seeking to reach the UK are more significant drivers of the crossings.</p>

          <p>Credit card issuers may lower credit limits with little or no warning due to factors like inactivity, a drop in credit score, high balances, missed payments, or changes in income. This action, while frustrating, is legal in most cases and can impact credit scores and financial flexibility. To mitigate the effects of a credit limit decrease, cardholders should contact the issuer for an explanation, request a credit limit increase, review credit utilization, monitor credit reports for errors, and consider switching to another card if necessary.

          <p>World Aquatics has announced that swimmers, coaches, and officials who compete in or support the Enhanced Games, a controversial event allowing performance-enhancing drugs, will be barred from elite competition. The Enhanced Games, set to debut in Las Vegas, explicitly permits the use of substances banned under global anti-doping rules. World Aquatics' move aims to discourage participation in events that embrace doping, prioritizing the integrity of the sport. The Enhanced Games' founder defends the event as a revolutionary platform embracing pharmaceutical and technological enhancement, but critics warn it undermines global sport and jeopardizes athletes' health.</p>

          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national and former University of Michigan student, has fled the U.S. after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote despite being ineligible, leading to state charges. After a judge ordered him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao used another passport to board a flight to Shanghai, China. He now faces a federal charge of flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The U.S. Attorney emphasized the seriousness of illegal voting, especially by foreign nationals from countries without a democratic tradition.</p>

          <p>Former Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer has won a court case by default, with a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordering Lindsey Hill, his accuser, to pay over $300,000 for violating a settlement agreement.

The settlement included a provision preventing Hill from stating that Bauer paid her any money as part of the agreement. After Hill made claims on social media that Bauer returned an insurance sum to her, Bauer sued her for violating the settlement, and the judge granted Bauer a victory by default due to Hill's lack of response.</p>

Pilgrims are required to use electronic identity cards and smart wristbands, which store personal information and track their movements, raising questions about the security and potential misuse of this data.

Trump is actively engaging with senators to garner support for the bill, which extends tax cuts and boosts spending while making cuts to assistance programs.

          <p>Millennials are entering midlife with a different set of challenges and expectations compared to previous generations, as they often lack the financial stability and traditional milestones. This generation, which entered the workforce during economic downturns, faces a midlife crisis characterized by a search for opportunity and personal fulfillment rather than a desire to abandon established lives. External factors like the economy and political climate also play a role in shaping their experiences. Experts suggest that millennials are better equipped to handle this transition by reframing it as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.</p>

Separately, the head of the UN's nuclear safety watchdog stated that conditions for restarting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant do not currently exist. The lack of water for cooling and an unstable power supply are key obstacles to resuming operations at the plant, which has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. Before any restart, a thorough inspection of the plant's machinery, which has been inoperable for three years, is necessary.</p>
