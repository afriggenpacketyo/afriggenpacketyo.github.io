          <h2>Trump Claims Victory After Iran Ceasefire, Cites Rutte's Praise</h2>

          <p>President Trump shared a congratulatory message from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte regarding the US military action in Iran, which Trump claims led to a ceasefire. Rutte praised Trump's "decisive action" in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, stating it was something no one else dared to do, also noting NATO's commitment to increasing defense spending. Despite the administration's claims of obliterating Iran's nuclear research facilities, US military intelligence suggests the damage may only set the program back by months, and questions remain about Iran's enriched uranium supply. While a fragile ceasefire is in place, the long-term stability of the region remains uncertain, and other conflicts inherited by Trump continue. The article notes JD Vance's take on what he calls the three parts of Trump's "foreign policy doctrine".</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives voted along bipartisan lines to table a resolution offered by Representative Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, to impeach President Donald Trump. The vote to table the measure, a procedural mechanism to avoid directly voting on the bill, was 344-79. The Fox News Politics newsletter also covers other topics, including the near collapse of Trump's Israel-Iran ceasefire, Jasmine Crockett dropping out of a race, and the Senate preparing for a showdown over a "Big, Beautiful Bill". Additional topics covered include border crossings, ICE arrests, defense systems, abortion rates, and Andrew Cuomo's potential political comeback.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alongside the unveiling of a major crypto bill in the Senate. The bill aims to define crypto as either a commodity or a security, allowing crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulation of digital assets. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev believes this regulatory development could help the US regain its lead in the crypto industry. Additionally, investors increased their bets on crypto company Digital Asset, signaling growing interest from major financial institutions in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that Republicans largely support the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, while a majority of the overall public disapproves. There are bipartisan concerns about the U.S. potentially getting involved in a wider war with Iran, and differing views on the effectiveness of the strikes. Most Americans believe that President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action against Iran. The poll also reveals that most Americans think Iran will try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests. The CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted between June 22-24, 2025, with a nationally representative sample of 1,720 U.S. adults.</p>

          <p>The prosecution and defense have rested their cases in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, where he faces charges of sexual assault and racketeering conspiracy. The prosecution presented over 30 witnesses, including former employees and two former girlfriends who testified about alleged sexual encounters and drug use directed by Combs. The defense team did not call any witnesses, instead moving for acquittal, arguing that the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proof. Closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday, and deliberations may begin the following Monday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people across multiple cities, citing a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity. The decision follows pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased, targeting Latino criminal organizations while overlooking white supremacist gangs. Gang injunctions are civil court orders that restrict suspected gang members from certain activities and associations within designated areas. Civil rights groups have long challenged the injunctions as overly broad and draconian, particularly as gang violence has declined.</p>

          <p>A U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could potentially produce a nuclear weapon within three to eight months, but there was no indication that it had made the decision to do so, prior to the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The assessment also revealed discussions among Iranian officials about moving highly enriched uranium to public parking lots to avoid destruction. The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a days-long air campaign by Israel. While the Pentagon initially claimed "extremely severe damage and destruction" to all three sites, the full impact of the strikes is still unclear.</p>

This move is described as "the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." The jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The use of nuclear weapons would require authorization from NATO's nuclear planning group, as well as the US president and British prime minister.

This move follows internal complaints about FBI agents being reassigned from counterterrorism and counterintelligence tasks to immigration enforcement.

The ruling follows a previous appellate court decision that deferred to the president's authority to federalize the National Guard, but it does not address the claim that troops are violating the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

Without continued international monitoring, Iran could end cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The article draws a parallel to North Korea's actions, which led to the development of nuclear weapons.

          <p>French football club Lyon has been demoted to Ligue 2 due to financial difficulties, a decision the club is appealing. The DNGC, which oversees the accounts of French professional football clubs, made the decision after determining that Lyon had not sufficiently improved their financial situation. Lyon officials, including owner John Textor, met with the DNGC but failed to overturn the provisional demotion issued in November. The club has stated that the decision is "incomprehensible" and that they will appeal to demonstrate their ability to provide the necessary financial resources to remain in Ligue 1.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aiming for another $1 billion in savings in the upcoming fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with ground home delivery volume up 10%. While FedEx beat earnings estimates, its stock dropped in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that was slightly below Wall Street's expectations. The company also reaffirmed its plans to spin off its Freight division. (not investment advice)</p>

However, Anthropic will face a separate trial in December regarding the downloading of millions of pirated books, which the court found may have broken the law. The case was filed by three authors who alleged copyright infringement after Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude.</p>

The number of detainees arrested in the interior of the country has risen significantly.
