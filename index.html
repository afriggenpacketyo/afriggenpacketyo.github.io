          <h2>Arkansas Governor and Lawmakers Lobby Trump to Reconsider Disaster Relief Denial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 21:37:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are appealing to President Trump after FEMA denied Arkansas' request for federal disaster relief following severe storms in March, which caused significant damage and three deaths. The lawmakers argue that federal assistance is crucial for the state's recovery. This situation is notable as it's the first instance of Republicans publicly challenging a FEMA denial under the Trump administration. During a prior visit to North Carolina, Trump criticized FEMA, suggesting states should handle disaster relief independently, reflecting his administration's stance on federal versus state responsibilities in such events.</p>

          <p>A bill proposed by Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, AB 942, seeks to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels, sparking a debate between union electrical workers, utility companies, and solar panel owners. Solar owners protested the bill, arguing they wouldn't have invested if incentives were temporary, while Calderon argues it's unfair to non-solar customers who pay higher electric bills. Utilities support the bill, estimating savings for non-solar customers, while environmental groups and the solar industry oppose it, claiming the state promised 20-year contracts and pointing to rising utility infrastructure costs as the real issue.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the installation of a makeup studio next to the Pentagon press briefing room, prompting scrutiny over the cost and timing of the project. The renovation, aimed at improving preparations for television appearances, involved modifying an existing green room.
