          <p>Amazon Web Services is enhancing its Graviton4 chip with improved network bandwidth, aiming to provide a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's GPUs for AI training. AWS has invested significantly in Anthropic, allocating $8 billion to support the startup's AI supercomputer, Project Rainier. The objective is to lower AI training expenses, presenting a competitive solution against Nvidia's high-priced graphics processing units. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model is currently operating on Trainium2 GPUs, and Project Rainier is powered by a substantial number of these chips. This strategic move signifies AWS's commitment to challenging Nvidia's stronghold in the AI infrastructure domain.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in a multiday operation targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, including the underground uranium enrichment site at Fordo, according to CBS News sources. Internal disagreements exist among Trump's advisors regarding the proposed course of action, which was slated for discussion during a meeting with the national security team. While Israel alleges Iran is rapidly advancing its nuclear weapons program, a U.S. intelligence assessment earlier this year indicated that Iran is not currently building such weapons, though pressure may be mounting on the regime to restart the program. Despite not ruling out U.S. involvement, the Trump administration has publicly stated its non-participation in Israel's offensive, although previous reports suggest U.S. assistance in intercepting Iranian missiles.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, with a 68-30 vote after overcoming initial Democratic resistance. The bill requires members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, offers stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors, and directs the Treasury to monitor suspicious transactions. Concerns about President Trump's family's crypto ventures and Binance initially stalled the bill, leading to strengthened provisions against corruption. Despite some Democratic opposition, the bill's supporters argue it provides much-needed regulatory clarity for the digital asset space. (not investment advice)</p>

French police say they cannot intervene at sea without risking drownings, focusing instead on intercepting boats before launch. This system favors young men over women and children, who struggle to board from the water, while the UK is seen as a magnet for migrants.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities, with judges expressing skepticism about the state's arguments against the mobilization. The Justice Department argues that the president's decision is not subject to judicial review, while California contends that Trump circumvented Governor Newsom and that the presence of troops escalates tensions. The case involves interpreting Title 10, which outlines the circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service, and whether Trump properly notified Newsom of the deployment.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making break-even operating margins in 2025 unlikely.

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, introduced by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes. Women who terminate their pregnancies outside legal guidelines will no longer face police investigations, although penalties remain for those assisting women in such terminations. The new law will not change the provision of abortion services within healthcare settings or the requirement for two doctors' approval.</p>

Initially convicted based on blood spatter in the bedroom and a syringe with her fingerprint and Bob's blood, Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout. The prosecution eventually conceded that the DNA evidence was significantly different from what was presented at trial, leading to the overturning of her conviction.</p>
