          <p>Two people have been found shot to death inside a home in Encino, Los Angeles, during a welfare check conducted by police. The victims, who have not yet been named, both had gunshot wounds to the head, and investigators discovered a broken sliding glass door at the scene. The Los Angeles Police Department is treating the case as a double homicide and has not yet made any arrests. Authorities are in the process of notifying the next of kin as the investigation into this developing situation continues.</p>

          <p>Legislation aimed at regulating the cryptocurrency industry, which had received backing from President Donald Trump, failed to pass a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives. The measure was blocked with a 196-223 vote, as 13 Republicans joined Democrats in opposition, marking a significant setback for the crypto sector. In response to the failed vote, the prices of several crypto-related stocks, including Coinbase and Circle, experienced a notable decline. House leadership may attempt another vote to advance the package, potentially with modifications to secure the necessary support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods in New Jersey resulted in the deaths of two people whose car was swept into a brook in Plainfield, bringing the city's recent storm-related death toll to four. The extreme weather caused widespread disruption, with officials in nearby North Plainfield rescuing approximately 40 people from chest-high water. The storms prompted a state of emergency in New Jersey and caused significant travel chaos, including over 2,000 flight cancellations and major disruptions to rail services across the region. The flood threat is expected to continue moving south through the Mid-Atlantic states.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the Trump administration's decision to permit Nvidia to resume selling AI chips to China involves significant restrictions. Lutnick stated that China would only receive Nvidia's "fourth best" chip, which is considerably slower than the top-tier technology used by American companies. This strategic move is designed to keep China reliant on the American technology ecosystem without providing access to the most advanced hardware. The policy reversal, which followed a meeting between President Trump and Nvidia's CEO, aims to balance trade with national security interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin has accused the Trump administration of undermining efforts to combat organized retail theft by reassigning federal agents to immigration enforcement. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Durbin argued that critical resources from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) are being diverted from tackling criminal networks to support the president's "mass deportation agenda." Republicans countered by highlighting the severity of organized retail crime, with Senator Chuck Grassley noting its links to cartels and human traffickers. The hearing also featured testimony on the dramatic rise in cargo theft, which now costs the supply chain an estimated $35 billion annually.</p>
