            <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with imposing severe tariffs against U.S. trading partners, causing turbulence in world markets. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the U.S. aims to secure fair deals with all countries, and President Trump dismissed the possibility of pausing tariffs for negotiations. Trump also threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs and suggested additional tariffs on China for retaliatory measures, potentially raising the total tariff on some Chinese goods to 104%. These actions signal a firm stance on trade despite market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>USAID has terminated a scholarship program that enabled 208 Afghan women to pursue online courses at the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF), defying the Taliban's ban on female university education. The program, funded by a $50 million USAID endowment managed by Texas A&M University Foundation, is being cut due to a review deeming it inconsistent with the administration's priorities. This decision has left the students and program organizers in uncertainty, as they seek clarification on whether the funding can continue until the end of the semester or through 2030 to allow current students to complete their studies. Human rights groups have criticized the decision, calling it a blow to Afghan women's education.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles has announced the formation of a criminal task force to investigate potential fraud and corruption involving local homelessness funds. The investigation will focus on the misappropriation of federal tax dollars intended to alleviate homelessness in the Central District of California. The task force will review federal, state, and local programs receiving federal grants and funding, as well as investigate fraud schemes involving the theft of private donations. The announcement follows a court-ordered audit that found major flaws in homeless services and a decision by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to pull funding from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.</p>

            <p>Arrests at Santa Barbara’s annual unsanctioned Deltopia street party rose for the fourth straight year this weekend, more than doubling the number of arrests from 2024, authorities said. Isla Vista’s weekend-long Deltopia party, which draws thousands of local college students to raucous festivities near the beach, has seen arrests and citations grow each year since 2021, according to stats released by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. The most serious arrest last weekend came when officers stopped a group of people on Saturday morning on Marketplace Drive as the group headed toward Deltopia. One of the members of the group was in possession of a loaded gun, the sheriff’s office said.</p>

            <p>A columnist responds to a reader's question about dealing with the fear of death in middle age, sharing personal experiences and offering advice. The author suggests treating the fear of death as a symptom rather than a problem to be solved and developing a personal emergency philosophy. The advice includes reconnecting with one's body, taking pleasure in life, and finding courage. The columnist acknowledges that middle age often brings awareness of mortality but emphasizes the importance of living fully in the present.</p>

Water fluoridation has been supported by the U.S. government since 1950 as a measure to reduce tooth decay, but concerns about its health effects have persisted for decades.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Justice Department has shut down its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, signaling a shift towards a decentralized approach focused on crimes involving terrorism and fraud. U.S. attorney's offices will now take the lead on digital asset cases, prioritizing the prosecution of individuals who victimize digital asset investors or use digital assets in criminal offenses. This move represents a reversal of previous policies under President Joe Biden and aligns with President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance. The DOJ also states it will not pursue enforcement against crypto exchanges or offline wallets for the actions of their users unless willful violations can be proven. (not investment advice)</p>

The company says it extracted dire wolf DNA from fossils and made 20 edits to the gray wolf genome to create animals with dire wolf traits. Critics question whether the pups are true dire wolves or simply gray wolves modified to resemble them. The company maintains that the goal is to restore the functional traits and ecological role of lost species, with applications for endangered species facing extinction today.</p>

The finale's decision to avoid depicting the consequences of Tim's actions has left some viewers feeling unresolved and disturbed by the show's handling of such a fraught subject.</p>

Since then, he has posted 11 top-10 finishes in majors.
