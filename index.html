          <p>Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old employee of the US "department of government efficiency" (Doge), has resigned, according to a White House official, following Elon Musk's departure a month prior. Coristine, known online as ‚ÄúBig Balls,‚Äù previously worked at Musk‚Äôs Neuralink before joining Doge, which was established by the Trump administration and has overseen job cuts across federal agencies. Coristine's youth and online moniker became a pop-culture meme during his tenure at Doge. Prior to his time at Doge, Coristine had a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services to various clients, including a website run by a cybercrime ring. The circumstances surrounding his departure remain unclear, but his resignation marks another key figure leaving Doge. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City mayoral primary race is still uncertain even after polls closed, due to the city's ranked-choice voting system. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holds a slight lead with over 43% of first-choice votes, surpassing former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who garnered over 36%. Ranked-choice voting, first used in the mayoral primary in 2021, allows voters to rank up to five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed until a candidate surpasses the 50% threshold. The final outcome may take time, with ranked-choice tabulations not starting until July 1, allowing for mail-in ballots to be received. </p>

          <p>Authorities in Madera County, California, arrested Andrew Biscay, 40, for allegedly impersonating a U.S. Marshal.

The vehicle Biscay allegedly used had a star painted on the side, and he was booked on multiple felony and misdemeanor charges with bail set at $70,000.

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by only a few months. The Defense Intelligence Agency found that while the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed, the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes, and the assessment provides a range of possibilities for when Iran could resume their nuclear work. The White House has disputed these findings, while others stand by claims that the strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear capabilities. </p>

While greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen by over half since 1990, transport and buildings remain the largest emitters. Sales of electric heat pumps have grown significantly, but they remain expensive to install and operate due to high electricity costs, requiring government intervention to make electricity cheaper. </p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into star formation. Researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. </p>
