          <p>A Florida jury has found Ryan Routh guilty on all five charges related to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a golf course in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself, argued there was no crime as the weapon was never fired, but prosecutors detailed a weeks-long plot to kill the then-presidential candidate. Following the verdict, Routh attempted to harm himself in the courtroom before being subdued by U.S. marshals. He now faces a potential life sentence, marking a conviction in the second of two assassination attempts against Trump during the 2024 election cycle.</p>

          <p>A conservative policy group, the American Energy Institute, is pressuring House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan to subpoena the Environmental Law Institute's Climate Judiciary Project. The call for a subpoena follows a court filing that allegedly reveals undisclosed involvement of a plaintiffs' attorney in scientific studies used as evidence in climate lawsuits. The group claims this suggests 'covert coordination and judicial manipulation,' questioning the neutrality of judicial training materials provided by the project. The Environmental Law Institute has denied the allegations, stating its educational curriculum is fact-based and that it does not coordinate with litigators.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the combination of rising inflation and a slowdown in hiring as a 'challenging situation' for the U.S. economy. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell noted that the risks to employment have increased, which influenced the central bank's recent decision to cut interest rates for the first time this year. Despite the rate cut, he expressed continued uncertainty about the path of inflation, highlighting the difficult balance the Fed must strike. The remarks come amid ongoing pressure from the Trump administration for more significant rate reductions to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump criticized the organization's New York headquarters, recounting his own failed bid to manage its renovation years ago. He claimed he could have completed the project for far less money and with superior materials, stating the UN ultimately chose a more expensive and inferior option. Trump's wide-ranging address also questioned the UN's effectiveness, calling it an organization of 'empty words' that fails to live up to its potential. His remarks were further punctuated by complaints about a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter at the venue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a decree officially classifying the Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization, directing the government to investigate and dismantle its operations and funding. The White House described Antifa as a 'militarist, anarchist enterprise' aiming to overthrow the U.S. government. This move follows Trump's repeated assertions linking the movement to political violence, including the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Legal experts have previously raised concerns about such a designation, citing Antifa's lack of a centralized structure and potential conflicts with First Amendment protections for political beliefs.</p>

          <p>YouTube has announced it will soon launch a pilot program allowing creators whose channels were terminated for Covid-19 or election misinformation to apply for reinstatement. This marks a significant reversal of its previous policy, which treated such violations as lifetime bans. The change was revealed in a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, following Republican pressure on tech companies to roll back content moderation policies from the Biden era. YouTube stated that its community guidelines now permit a wider range of content on these topics and that the new program will initially be open to a limited subset of creators.</p>

Democrats had sought the meeting to negotiate a short-term funding extension that includes provisions for health insurance tax credits.

Heuermann was initially charged in 2023 with three killings, with four additional charges added later. His defense team had argued that combining the cases, which span nearly two decades, would create a risk of prejudice with the jury. Prosecutors successfully contended that the cases were linked by Heuermann's 'modus operandi' and his familiarity with the locations where the remains were discovered.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell forcefully defended the central bank's independence, dismissing claims that its decisions are politically motivated as a 'cheap shot.' While not mentioning him by name, the comments were a clear response to President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell and the Fed for not cutting interest rates more aggressively. Powell's remarks come amid an unprecedented campaign by the White House to reshape the Fed's board. He reiterated that the Fed's decisions are driven by economic data, acknowledging the current challenge of balancing upside risks to inflation with downside risks to employment.

          <p>A group of 34 Palestinian students who were evacuated from Gaza last week have arrived in the United Kingdom to begin their university studies. This is the first time since the war began that a group has been assisted in leaving the territory for educational purposes in the UK. The students, all of whom hold fully funded scholarships, were taken to Jordan to complete visa checks before traveling. While celebrating the opportunity, a coordinator noted the students face the difficult process of settling in while their families remain in Gaza. An additional 40 students are awaiting the next round of evacuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from CDC researchers reveals that U.S. infection rates from highly drug-resistant 'nightmare bacteria' increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The surge was primarily driven by bacteria containing the NDM gene, which are resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. These infections, once rare and linked to overseas medical care, are now spreading more within the community. Researchers suggest the rise may be linked to increased antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, collected from 29 states, likely underestimates the full scope of the problem nationally.</p>

Both station groups, which control dozens of ABC affiliates, cited the need for respectful dialogue and are evaluating the show's potential return.

The move follows a broader review of advisory committees, which were instructed to demonstrate their alignment with a 'warrior ethos.'

Some American players, including Scottie Scheffler and Keegan Bradley, have confirmed they will donate their entire fee to charity.

In response, the FDA clarified that while an association has been studied, a causal link has not been established.

He argues that if Kimmel and his network capitulate to pressure from the FCC and the Trump administration, it will set a dangerous precedent for censoring other media figures.
