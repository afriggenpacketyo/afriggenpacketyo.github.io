          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, is a crucial tool for millions of American retirees to cover out-of-pocket costs not handled by Original Medicare. The average monthly premiums for these plans in 2025 can vary widely, typically ranging from $32 for high-deductible options to over $550 for comprehensive coverage. Most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month, with costs depending heavily on location, age, gender, and the specific plan chosen. To lower costs, experts advise enrolling when first eligible, comparing plans carefully, and considering options with higher deductibles or fewer benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, has rested his defense case after calling only three witnesses. The trial, presided over by Judge Aileen Cannon, saw Routh represent himself and question a former Marine sniper about the rifle's capabilities and potential malfunctions. Prosecutors had previously presented their case over seven days with 38 witnesses, detailing the alleged planned attack at Trump's golf club. Closing arguments are scheduled to proceed, with the jury soon to begin deliberations on the five counts Routh faces.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted an injunction allowing the Danish renewable energy company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island. The Trump administration's Interior Department had issued a stop-work order for the nearly completed project, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. Orsted argued the order was arbitrary and issued in bad faith, a position the court appeared to support with its ruling. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry in the United States.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner for New York City mayor, has canceled his appearance at a WABC-TV town hall to protest ABC's suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. The suspension followed pressure from the Trump administration after Kimmel's comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Mamdani stated his withdrawal is a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over press freedom. The move adds to a growing backlash against the network's decision, which has been criticized as a capitulation to government pressure on free speech.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and OpenAI have announced a major partnership in which the chipmaker will invest up to $100 billion into the AI research lab. The investment is aimed at building a massive network of data centers, powered by Nvidia's processors, that will require 10 gigawatts of power. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the project as "monumental," noting it represents a significant expansion of AI computing capacity.

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial, which had previously unseated Bud Light. The shift marks a significant comeback for parent company AB InBev after Bud Light faced a conservative backlash two years ago. Modelo's decline is attributed to several factors, including tariffs and reduced spending among its core Hispanic consumer base, which parent company Constellation Brands noted has been impacted by the current economic climate. This change in market leadership reflects evolving consumer preferences and ongoing economic pressures affecting major brewers.</p>

The riot involved gunfire and explosives, leading to an unknown number of inmates escaping, although 13 have since been recaptured. The incident highlights the ongoing crisis within Ecuador's overcrowded and gang-controlled prison system, which has been under military control since a state of "internal armed conflict" was declared earlier in the year.

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's expected announcement linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism, medical experts and the drug's manufacturer are pushing back. Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, stated that independent science shows no causal link and that acetaminophen remains the safest pain relief option for pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a major Swedish study support this consensus, finding no increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Health professionals worry the administration's claims could lead expectant mothers to use riskier alternatives or leave dangerous conditions like high fevers untreated.</p>

          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed in September, drew nearly 100,000 people and functioned as both a religious revival and a potent political rally for the Republican party. The event featured emotional speeches, including from Kirk's widow, Erika, who forgave the killer and is now leading his Turning Point USA organization. Political figures like Donald Trump and Stephen Miller used the platform to deliver aggressive messages, vowing to fight harder against their opponents. Democrats have remained largely silent, navigating a delicate political landscape in their response to the event.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron or ambassador by six charities after a 2011 email surfaced in which she referred to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and Julia's House children's hospice, deemed her continued association inappropriate. The email appeared to contradict her previous public statements denouncing Epstein. A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the message was sent to placate Epstein after he threatened to sue her, and that she stands by her condemnation of his actions.</p>

Acknowledging Reform's recent lead in opinion polls, Davey stated his party needs to more effectively challenge Farage on issues like immigration and the cost of living to win over disillusioned voters.</p>

          <p>Google is set to begin a new trial against the U.S. Department of Justice, this time focusing on its alleged illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market. The case, held in a Virginia federal court, will determine the remedy after a judge previously ruled that parts of Google's ad technology business stifle competition. The Justice Department is advocating for a breakup of Google's ad-tech divisions to restore market fairness, a proposal Google claims would be disruptive and damaging. This legal battle follows a separate antitrust case concerning Google's search dominance, where the company avoided the most severe penalties.</p>

This measure is designed to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access data or influence content for the app's 170 million American users. The new structure aims to create a secure, U.S.-controlled version of the popular social media platform.</p>
