        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court temporarily allowed the Trump administration to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Venezuelan migrants, despite a lower court's injunction.  The lower court argued the termination was based on negative stereotypes and unconstitutional animus.  The Trump administration contended that maintaining TPS was contrary to national interest, and the Supreme Court's decision allows the administration to proceed while legal challenges continue. This ruling has significant implications for the roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. who could face deportation.</p>
