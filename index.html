This incident adds to a pattern of Trump's engagement with outlandish theories and unsubstantiated allegations.

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecasted to potentially make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., even as far south as northern California and Alabama. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with this storm, which is expected to last through late Monday. The coronal mass ejection causing the storm could disrupt power systems, impede satellite operations, and hamper radio communications. The northern lights are caused by solar wind hitting Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere and are typically best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, new US-China tariffs are expected to impact the Chinese technology sector in two main ways. The tariffs will make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, and Chinese companies will need to work harder on cutting costs and scaling up. Chinese companies may look more aggressively to other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and increase efforts to deepen trade with Europe, including offering technology transfers in exchange for market access.</p>

          <p>Former President Bill Clinton defended Joe Biden's cognitive health in an interview, dismissing claims of cognitive decline. Clinton stated that he never witnessed any signs of Biden being unfit for the presidency and that Biden was always "on top of his briefs." He also revealed that he chose not to read a book alleging Biden's cognitive decline, believing it was an attempt to blame Biden for Trump's reelection. Biden's health had been a concern among voters, but Clinton's comments aim to dispel those doubts.</p>
