          <p>In an exclusive interview with ABC News, President Trump defended his trade policies, asserting that China will absorb the costs of tariffs and downplaying Americans' economic anxieties.  This interview aired as a new poll revealed widespread concern over Trump's trade policies and their potential impact on prices and the stock market.  Trump claimed that gasoline, grocery, and egg prices have decreased since his inauguration, despite economists' warnings of price increases due to tariffs.  The article contrasts Trump's optimistic outlook with public opinion.</p>
