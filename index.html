          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused devastating flooding across Arizona, resulting in at least three confirmed fatalities and leaving others potentially missing, prompting a massive search and rescue operation. The city of Globe faces a severe hazard with approximately 1,000 residential-sized propane tanks displaced by the floodwaters, although none have ignited or exploded, requiring hazmat intervention. Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport recorded its highest one-day rainfall in nearly seven years, contributing to the rapid inundation of downtown areas. Local officials have declared an emergency, describing the event as unprecedented and causing significant damage to buildings. Residents are urged to avoid floodwaters and assist neighbors, with efforts focused on ensuring public safety.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has secured a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections critical for the nation's path toward the European Union. The electoral process was overshadowed by President Sandu's strong warnings of "massive Russian interference," including multiple bomb scares reported at polling stations both domestically and abroad, and arrests related to alleged plots for post-election unrest. Despite these challenges and opposition claims of victory, PAS garnered over 50% of the vote, significantly ahead of its pro-Russian rivals. This result signals a clear mandate for continued European integration, amidst persistent concerns about Russian influence and the country's internal issues like corruption and high prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article offers a scathing critique of Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," which recounts her presidential campaign, labeling it a "farce" born from a profound lack of self-awareness. The author contends that the book portrays Harris as a politician preoccupied with the mechanics and spectacle of politics, rather than driven by deep conviction or a unique policy agenda, exemplified by her reluctance to diverge significantly from Joe Biden. The campaign's reliance on celebrity and "vibes" is highlighted as a failure to connect with broader voter concerns. Ultimately, the article suggests the memoir inadvertently exposes a broader delusion within the Democratic establishment, questioning its capacity to effectively challenge Donald Trump and Trumpism.</p>

          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent was directly targeted by a criminal gang named Medusa, which attempted to recruit him as an insider to hack BBC systems through his work laptop. The reporter, acting on advice, engaged with the group to understand their modus operandi, which involved offering a significant percentage of a potential multi-million-dollar ransom. Medusa, a ransomware-as-a-service operation suspected of originating from Russia or allied states, boasted prior success in leveraging internal access. When the reporter delayed, the criminals escalated their pressure by launching MFA bombing attacks on his phone, leading to his temporary disconnection from BBC systems for security. This experience provided a stark and personal insight into the sophisticated and aggressive tactics employed by cybercriminals in pursuing insider threats.</p>

Mykolaienko notably refused an earlier prisoner exchange in 2022, insisting a seriously injured Ukrainian soldier take his place, prioritizing the release of the most vulnerable. Upon his return in August 2025, he was shocked by the ongoing civilian casualties in Kherson and expressed a desire for all Ukrainians to contribute to the war effort, whether on the front lines or as volunteers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs predicts China's central bank is increasingly likely to implement monetary easing in the fourth quarter, including a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This anticipated move responds to a slowdown in economic momentum, with year-on-year growth projected to fall sharply towards 4% from last year's high base. The People's Bank of China's recent Monetary Policy Committee meeting revealed a dovish stance, marked by a cautious shift in its economic outlook from "showing positive momentum" to "making strides while maintaining stability." However, the article notes that actual policy action remains data-dependent, with the possibility of no changes if the full-year growth target of "around 5%" remains achievable.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially ended his bid for reelection, attributing his decision to persistent media scrutiny and the Campaign Finance Board's choice to withhold campaign funds. His withdrawal transforms the mayoral race into a three-way contest among Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams's tenure was marked by a federal corruption scandal and criticism regarding his ties to the Trump administration, although he consistently denied any wrongdoing. Following his announcement, Mamdani and Cuomo immediately began framing the election as a direct contest between them, while other prominent New York leaders acknowledged Adams's contributions and legacy during his time in office.</p>

          <p>Regulators are struggling to keep pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of AI therapy applications, resulting in a fragmented approach to oversight across different states. Some states, like Illinois and Nevada, have outright banned AI for mental health treatment, while others, such as Utah, have imposed specific limitations, including disclosure requirements and data protection. However, many existing laws fail to address generic chatbots frequently used for therapeutic purposes, which have been linked to severe user incidents. Mental health advocates are strongly advocating for comprehensive federal regulation and oversight, emphasizing the critical need for human empathy, clinical judgment, and ethical responsibility that current AI models cannot fully replicate, despite some promising research into human-monitored AI chatbots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deliveries of China's C919 narrowbody passenger jet to the country's top three domestic airlines are reportedly falling behind schedule, according to recent financial reports, sparking market speculation about potential disruptions to the model's engine supply. Both Air China and China Eastern Airlines received only one C919 aircraft each in the first half of the year, significantly short of their stated goals of adding ten planes apiece in 2025. China Southern Airlines' reports indicated it had "financially leased" only three jets as of June, with no mention of ownership, against an expectation of twelve. Independent aviation analysts suggest that Comac, the Shanghai-based manufacturer, may be encountering difficulties in securing crucial engines, potentially impeding its ambition to compete with established Western aviation giants.</p>

Her absence represents a significant setback for the Trojans' championship aspirations, though the arrival of highly-touted prospect Jazzy Davidson is anticipated to help mitigate the impact.

Mayor Bass condemned this type of violence as "reprehensible," and her directive for enhanced security aims to bolster public safety and uphold the sanctity of religious sites within Los Angeles, which is home to thousands of diverse places of worship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts, including psychologists and journalists, are providing strategies for recognizing and effectively managing "energy vampire" friendships—relationships where individuals consistently deplete one's emotional and mental energy. Key indicators of such dynamics include friends who exhibit an excessive need for attention, constantly talk about themselves without reciprocity, or subtly undermine your mood with backhanded compliments. The initial recommended approach involves open and honest communication, directly expressing feelings of not being heard or having sufficient space in the conversation. If the friend is unwilling to change, establishing clear boundaries, such as limiting the duration of interactions or defining acceptable conversation topics, becomes crucial. Altering shared activities, like engaging in physical activities together, can also help to shift the dynamic away from one-sided emotional draining.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are poised to formally resign on Tuesday, an event projected to be the largest mass resignation in United States history. This significant exodus is occurring as part of a Trump administration program aimed at enacting sweeping reductions to the federal workforce. Concurrently, with Congress nearing a critical deadline to authorize government funding and avert a shutdown, the White House has directed federal agencies to develop plans for extensive firings should a budget agreement fail. Workers who are departing describe a climate of "fear and intimidation" that left them with no alternative but to resign, citing a perceived dismantling of their mission, constant scapegoating, and profound job insecurity.</p>

This announcement coincided with the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, a pioneering large-vehicle carrier capable of operating on both traditional fuel and methanol. Despite green methanol's current cost being four times that of conventional fuel, its adoption is projected to increase significantly from 2027, driven by Europe's impending carbon emissions-based import tariff regime.</p>

Patients claimed the poor quality of care exacerbated their conditions, despite the unit previously receiving a "good" rating from the Care Quality Commission.

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for an expedited Supreme Court review of an executive order that seeks to unilaterally end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. Solicitor General John Sauer asserts a "compelling interest" in restricting citizenship to only those "lawfully entitled," arguing the lower courts' decisions undermine border security and wrongly confer citizenship on "hundreds of thousands of unqualified people." This action directly challenges over a century of settled legal precedent, including the landmark 1898 Supreme Court case U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, which affirmed that the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause applies to all persons born on U.S. territory. Despite federal courts twice blocking the order as likely unconstitutional, the administration seeks a definitive high court judgment.</p>

The suspect, Joshua Jahn, legally acquired the 8mm bolt-action rifle used in the attack and had meticulously planned the assault, with notes discovered at his residence revealing a strong animosity towards ICE personnel. Jahn fired rounds from the roof of a nearby office building, intending to cause damage and harm or kill agents. Tragically, three detainees inside targeted vans became victims, with one fatality and two others critically injured. Authorities highlighted the bravery of law enforcement in rescuing other detainees and condemned "wild rhetoric" and apps tracking ICE agents for a substantial rise in assaults on officers.</p>
