        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States government, under President Trump, has requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product, according to a Japan-U.S. diplomatic source. This request, reported by the Financial Times, is significantly higher than the 2% target Japan previously committed to by 2027. The increased demand will likely cause Japan to cancel a planned high-level meeting between the countries' foreign and defense chiefs in Washington. This meeting would have been the first since Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump took office, and it underscores ongoing tensions over defense burden-sharing between the two nations. The US administration is reportedly planning to ask Tokyo to pay more for American troops based in Japan once bilateral negotiations over tariffs proceed. (not investment advice)</p>

The Salt Lake District Attorney's office stated that they could not yet decide on charges against Gamboa, who allegedly moved toward the crowd with the weapon raised. An armed safety volunteer for the event fired three shots, wounding Gamboa and killing a demonstrator, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo. Gamboa's attorney maintains his innocence, stating that he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, while the investigation continues to determine who was at fault for the accidental shooting.</p>

The yacht was raised from a depth of 165 feet, and the operation required specialized divers and equipment. The vessel will be transported to Termini Imerese for further examination to determine the cause of the sinking, which a British report indicated was due to extreme wind conditions.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon, despite holding no official position, played a significant role in President Trump's decision to hold off on a potential strike against Iran's nuclear facility. Bannon reportedly advised Trump that Israeli intelligence couldn't be trusted and that the bunker-buster bomb might not work as planned. Other influential conservatives, like Senator Lindsey Graham, advocate for supporting Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat. While sources say Secretary of State Marco Rubio has become more aligned with a noninterventionist stance, Trump ultimately decided to delay any action, though he insisted Iran was close to a nuclear bomb.</p>

They coerce victims into filming violent or sexual acts, which are then used for extortion and shared online.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches the United States, experts are noting that US sunscreens may be less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. This is attributed to regulatory differences, as the FDA has not approved a new UV filter for sunscreen in over 20 years. While American sunscreens generally protect against UVB rays, those in countries like France, South Korea, and Japan have access to a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients. Despite this, dermatologists emphasize the importance of wearing sunscreen daily and recommend mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</p>

While Louisiana plans to appeal the decision, the court's ruling reinforces the principle that public schools should be welcoming to all students, regardless of their faith.

          <p>President Trump's initial inclination towards war in the Middle East has been tempered by his fear of responsibility, leading to a delayed decision on whether to engage militarily with Iran. The article suggests that Iran may exploit Trump's aversion to conflict by engaging in negotiations while reconstituting its nuclear program. The author argues that Trump has not taken necessary steps to prepare the nation for war, including seeking congressional authorization or rallying allies. This hesitation may reflect a self-awareness of his inability to unify the nation, leaving the country in a state of uncertainty.</p>
