          <p>A two-year-old Venezuelan toddler, Maikelys Antonella Espinoza, has been reunited with her mother in Venezuela after being separated when her parents were deported from the United States. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro greeted the toddler upon her return, which followed accusations from Venezuelan officials that the Trump administration had kidnapped her. The Department of Homeland Security had labeled the parents as members of the 'Tren de Aragua' criminal gang, allegations the mother denies. After being detained for months, the mother requested deportation to reunite with her child, who was in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents.

The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings and then to the governor's office for approval. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, while the brothers' attorney, Mark Geragos, expressed hope for their release, emphasizing the changed perspective of the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>The EU's General Court has annulled a European Commission decision to deny a journalist access to text messages between Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. The ruling raises questions about the Commission's commitment to transparency, particularly regarding the negotiation of a multibillion-euro COVID-19 vaccine contract. Critics argue that von der Leyen's leadership style has been centralized and secretive, damaging trust in the EU. The Commission must now either release the messages or provide a detailed explanation for their absence, and the European Parliament may demand an independent inquiry.</p>

          <p>Richard L. Garwin, a key architect of America's hydrogen bomb and long-time defense policy advisor, has died at 97.

          <p>The Justice Secretary has announced new limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison in England and Wales, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in jails. Offenders recalled for breaching their licenses will be released after a fixed 28-day period, freeing up approximately 1,400 prison places. This measure is intended to buy time while ministers overhaul the system, which is described as being 'on the brink of collapse.' The changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years but will not affect those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

Director Isaiah Saxon drew parallels between the film's themes and real-life issues in California, where increasing human-wildlife overlap has led to conflicts.

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order. The deal, announced during President Trump's state visit to Qatar, includes 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines. The White House estimates that the agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million total domestic jobs. This significant deal could provide a boost for Boeing, which has faced major safety concerns and financial challenges in recent years.</p>

          <p>A Seattle man survived a 400-foot fall off a mountain in Washington, traveling over 60 miles to find help after the accident killed his three companions. The group of four mountain climbers were abseiling down a steep gully in the northern Cascade mountain range when their protective equipment failed. The survivor, despite significant internal injuries, hiked out and drove to find a payphone to call for help. Preliminary investigations suggest that an anchor failure during rappelling caused the tragic accident.</p>
