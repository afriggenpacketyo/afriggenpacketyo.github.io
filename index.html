          <p>Semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with net bookings also showing strong demand. The company, a critical supplier for top chipmakers like TSMC and Intel, benefited from system upgrades and lower-than-expected tariff impacts. However, ASML provided a cautious outlook, with its third-quarter revenue forecast falling short of market predictions. Citing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, the company stated it is preparing for growth in 2026 but cannot confirm it at this stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the end of deployment for 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, which is about half the force sent to the city in response to protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The withdrawal follows legal challenges from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued the federal deployment was unlawful and depleted resources needed for wildfire season. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the decision as a victory for peaceful protest and local unity against what she termed a political maneuver. The remaining troops currently lack a clear mission.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested a 22-year-old suspect in the murder of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, who were found shot to death in their Encino, California home. Investigators believe the suspect, identified through surveillance footage and facial recognition, had previously broken into the fortified property through an unlocked door. The couple allegedly returned home and confronted the intruder, leading to the fatal shooting. The suspect reportedly has an extensive history of violent crimes, though previous charges were dropped.</p>

          <p>Indian police have arrested a suspect in the hit-and-run death of Fauja Singh, the 114-year-old British-Indian runner celebrated as the world's oldest marathoner. The accused was allegedly driving a speeding SUV that struck Singh during his afternoon walk in Punjab. Singh, who began running at age 89 and became a global inspiration, died from his injuries in the hospital. Despite his fame and achievements, including carrying the 2012 Olympic torch, Guinness World Records never officially recognized him due to the lack of a 1911 birth certificate.</p>

The article identifies a perfect storm of factors, including rising payroll taxes, increased minimum wage, and fierce competition from online giants like Amazon and Shein. This trend is leading to a structural shift, leaving many high streets dominated by vape shops and tattoo parlors instead of traditional retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent shift to support Ukraine with anti-missile systems is not a strategic or moral realignment but a transactional response to financial persuasion. The author suggests that Europe's commitment to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP and to directly purchase Patriot missile systems for Kyiv has successfully framed the aid as a deal, not a handout. This appeals to Trump's business-oriented worldview, making European allies a better "client" than Russia. The piece concludes that while this is a temporary relief for Ukraine, Trump's support remains unreliable and contingent on perceived financial benefit.</p>

          <p>The murder trial has begun for James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife, Angela Craig, by lacing her protein shakes with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors allege the 47-year-old was motivated by an affair with another dentist and financial troubles, and that he administered a final fatal dose while she was in the hospital. The defense argues that the evidence is insufficient and suggested the victim, who was aware of her husband's infidelities, may have been suicidal. Craig has pleaded not guilty to murder and other related charges.</p>

          <p>An article recounts the story of the U.S. firebombing of Kumagaya, Japan, which occurred less than 12 hours before Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II. The raid on August 14-15, 1945, killed at least 260 people and destroyed most of the city. The piece shares the poignant memories of survivors, including a woman born on the day of the attack and a priest whose temple was destroyed. It reflects on the moral complexities of the firebombing campaign, which General Curtis LeMay himself reportedly admitted would have been considered a war crime if the U.S. had lost.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the U.S., a reduction from a previously threatened 32% duty. In exchange, Trump stated the U.S. would gain "full access" to Indonesian markets with no tariffs on its goods. The agreement also reportedly includes Indonesian commitments to purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The deal follows a direct conversation between Trump and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, though Jakarta has not yet formally confirmed the terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, the Senate has advanced a Republican bill to cancel approximately $9 billion in previously approved government spending. The package, requested by President Trump, primarily targets foreign aid programs and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. An initial proposal to cut the popular PEPFAR global AIDS program was removed to secure more support. Democrats strongly oppose the measure, arguing it undermines the bipartisan appropriations process and harms crucial services, while Republicans frame it as a necessary step toward fiscal responsibility.</p>

This action is part of an aggressive expansion of a controversial policy to use "third country" agreements for deportations.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to "come forward and explain" the administration's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The call comes after Bondi faced criticism for stating in February that Epstein's alleged "client list" was on her desk, a comment she later clarified referred to a general "file."

The board resisted the demand, which came after country singer John Rich's campaign against a proposed TVA gas plant caught President Trump's attention. The article suggests this pressure may be a pretext for Trump to install a more politically allied CEO and potentially pursue the privatization of the TVA, a long-held goal in some conservative circles.</p>
