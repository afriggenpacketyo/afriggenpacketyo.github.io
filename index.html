Los Angeles authorities detailed calls to Kid Cudiâ€™s home, including a burglary report and an arson investigation where Cudi's Porsche was destroyed with a Molotov cocktail.

          <p>Canada's decision to cull 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm due to avian flu has drawn criticism and intervention from U.S. officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz. These figures have urged Canadian authorities to conduct further testing on the ostriches to gain scientific knowledge about the virus, with Dr. Oz even offering to relocate the birds to his ranch in Florida. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency ordered the culling after the virus spread through the farm, leading to a legal battle and protests. The owners argue the birds should be studied for their antibodies, while veterinarians emphasize the public health risk of keeping potentially infected birds alive.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the term "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out), coined to describe his pattern of announcing tariffs and then easing them, causing market fluctuations. When asked about the term, Trump called it a "nasty question" and insisted it's a negotiation tactic. He defended his strategy, claiming that his tariff threats have brought trading partners to the negotiation table. While some analysts suggest investors are becoming comfortable with this pattern, others warn about complacency regarding the potential impact of tariffs on prices and the U.S. fiscal outlook.

This development follows China's report to the United Nations about evasive maneuvers the Tiangong station had to perform to avoid collisions with SpaceX's Starlink satellites. The robotic thrusters would allow China to respond to close approaches by other spacecraft after assessing their intent.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has condemned Israel's new aid operation in southern Gaza following a chaotic launch where thousands of Palestinians rushed a food distribution site, prompting Israeli forces to fire warning shots. The operation is intended to bypass the UN and Hamas, but humanitarian groups say it is inadequate and violates humanitarian principles. The UN and European diplomats criticized the program, citing concerns over the disproportionate use of force and the politicization of aid. Israel claims the new system is an attempt to sideline Hamas, while the UN argues it replaces hundreds of distribution sites with just four, making aid less accessible to Palestinians.</p>

          <p>The recent fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C., near the Capital Jewish Museum is raising concerns about an increase in far-left militancy in the U.S. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, reportedly said he did it "for Palestine, I did it for Gaza." Authorities are investigating the killings as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism. Experts note that violence against Jewish targets has typically been associated with the far-right, making this incident an anomaly, while others suggest the ongoing conflict in Gaza continues to pose a threat within the U.S.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business, as the company's artificial intelligence chips are in high demand. The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this forecast is reduced due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. companies. The company's gaming division also experienced growth, and net income increased to $18.8 billion.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump administration health officials, have advocated for saving almost 400 ostriches at a farm in British Columbia from a cull. The owners of the Universal Ostrich Farm say the birds have been kept for research since 2020. Kennedy appealed to Canadian officials to consider studying the ostriches for bird flu antibodies. Dr. Oz offered to re-home the birds on his Florida ranch, but the farm rejected his proposal due to quarantine orders.</p>

          <p>International students are expressing anxiety and regret over applying to U.S. schools due to changes in visa policies implemented by the Trump administration. The administration is planning to temporarily halt U.S. student visa appointments and increase social media vetting. This is part of a wider crackdown on universities, leading to uncertainty and delays for students. Some students fear being sent back to their home countries without completing their degrees and are questioning the viability of studying in the U.S.</p>
