          <p>The Village of Broadview has launched a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter's truck was hit by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent near a detention facility. Reporter Asal Rezaei stated she was alone, with no active protest, when the masked agent shot the projectile, causing chemical agents to engulf her vehicle, leaving her face burning and inducing vomiting. Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills condemned the "unprovoked attack" and expects full cooperation from the Department of Homeland Security in their probe. This incident has sparked significant concern regarding the conduct of federal agents and potential infringements on press freedom, with local authorities actively pursuing accountability for the actions taken and demanding transparency.</p>

          <p>A horrific attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, left four people dead and eight injured during a Sunday service. The suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove into the church, opened fire with an assault-style rifle, and then ignited a fire using an accelerant before being shot dead by police in the parking lot. Hundreds were present, with many showing heroism by shielding children from the violence. Authorities are investigating the motive behind this targeted act, with the FBI leading the extensive inquiry, which also involves responding to additional bomb threats at other locations in the area.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, driven by advancements in AI, efforts towards chip self-sufficiency, and Beijing's campaign against price wars, fueling investor optimism. However, as retail investors heavily influence the market, some experts are questioning if it's entering bubble territory, despite policy tailwinds. The CSI 300 index is near three-year highs, with the IT index reaching 2015 levels, yet economic fundamentals don't fully support this momentum. Analysts like Hao Hong suggest it's not a full bubble yet but is heading that way, especially in tech sectors, while Nomura warns of excessive leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

Strategies for handling such friendships include open and honest communication about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries to protect oneself, and modifying shared activities to reduce intensity, such as engaging in physical activities like walks instead of conversation-heavy meetups, to foster healthier interactions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, after federal courts blocked it twice. The administration argues for a definitive judgment on Trump's reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, which has long been understood to grant citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer emphasized the government's interest in controlling who receives American citizenship, asserting that hundreds of thousands of "unqualified people" currently receive it. Critics, including the ACLU, maintain the order is illegal and an "earthquake" if upheld, challenging over a century of legal precedent set by U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have confirmed that the shooter who attacked the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas specifically targeted ICE agents and acted alone. Joshua Jahn, the identified suspect, legally acquired the rifle and had meticulously planned the assault, with notes found at his residence indicating deep animosity towards ICE. Firing from a nearby rooftop, Jahn intended to cause harm or fatalities, tragically resulting in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others. This article underscores concerns about dangerous rhetoric contributing to a significant increase in assaults on ICE officers and the alarming use of apps to track agents.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European party, led by President Maia Sandu, has achieved a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections critical for the nation's EU aspirations. With 96% of votes tallied, Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) secured close to 50%, significantly outperforming the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc. The electoral process was heavily impacted by claims of "massive Russian interference," including bomb threats at polling stations and arrests for alleged unrest plots. Despite opposition leader Igor Dodon's calls for protests, the result solidifies Moldova's European path, though concerns about Russian influence and internal stability persist.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit to prevent President Donald Trump's deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, asserting his characterization of the city as "war ravaged" is "pure fiction." Governor Tina Kotek stated there is no insurrection requiring military intervention, despite a Pentagon memo authorizing the 60-day deployment to protect federal property. Attorney General Dan Rayfield labeled Trump's action "unlawful," arguing that local law enforcement is fully capable of managing the small protest outside an ICE office. This article underscores concerns that Trump's justification relies on misleading social media and Fox News reports, prompting a legal challenge to the federal overreach.</p>

          <p>President Trump voiced confidence ahead of Monday's crucial meeting with congressional leaders, stating that a government shutdown is probable unless Democrats yield on their negotiating positions regarding spending. He expressed belief that the American public would support his stance on spending cuts, anticipating political repercussions for Democrats if funding expires without a deal. The White House has already directed federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs in the event of a shutdown, highlighting the seriousness of the situation. Trump emphasized that any healthcare discussions must integrate immigration and border security, a demand Democrats have strongly opposed, underscoring the profound partisan deadlock threatening government operations and essential public services.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at the American Fish Company, a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, resulted in three fatalities and at least five injuries on Saturday night, sending shockwaves through the community.

Edge now faces numerous charges, including three counts of first-degree murder.
