          <h2>New US Tariffs on Brazilian Coffee Imports Raise Prices and Concerns for New York Cafes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian goods is causing significant concern for New York City coffee shops, which operate on thin margins. Cafe owners fear that passing the increased costs from tariffs onto consumers could make their products unaffordable, potentially jeopardizing their businesses. While some are trying to absorb the costs, price hikes are becoming inevitable, adding to the financial strain on both small business owners and their customers. The tariffs also create uncertainty for coffee producers in Brazil and other nations, who now face competitive disadvantages and disruptions in trade with the United States.</p>

          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny's 30-concert residency in San Juan has transformed into a deeply meaningful cultural event, drawing thousands of Puerto Ricans back to the island they left due to economic hardship. The concert series, titled "I Don't Want To Leave Here," directly addresses the pain of emigration and serves as a cathartic celebration of Puerto Rican identity and heritage. For many attendees, the experience has reinforced their connection to their homeland and inspired a renewed sense of pride and determination to one day return permanently. The event highlights the artist's significant role in uniting and validating the experiences of both island residents and the extensive Puerto Rican diaspora.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers across the United States are facing rapidly increasing electricity bills, with prices climbing more than twice as fast as overall inflation over the past year. This surge is driven by a combination of factors, including the immense power demands of new artificial intelligence data centers and the rising cost of natural gas, a primary fuel for power generation. As more natural gas is exported, domestic prices increase, compounding the financial pressure on households, particularly low-income families who already struggle with utility payments. The situation presents a challenge for regulators and utilities trying to meet growing demand while keeping energy affordable for everyone.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order signed by President Trump is setting the stage for alternative assets like cryptocurrency, real estate, and private equity to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to democratize access to investments historically reserved for wealthy individuals and large institutions, but it also introduces new complexities and risks for average savers. Financial experts caution that these assets come with higher fees, greater volatility, and less transparency compared to traditional stocks and bonds. While the order removes previous guidance that discouraged such investments, employers, as fiduciaries, will ultimately decide whether to offer these riskier options to their employees.

          <p>The recent summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska has elicited a wide range of reactions from world leaders and U.S. legislators, characterized by both disappointment and cautious optimism. Many U.S. lawmakers criticized the meeting for yielding no concrete commitments from Russia on a ceasefire in Ukraine, with some accusing Trump of being outmaneuvered. Conversely, others expressed tentative hope that the dialogue could lead to future trilateral talks involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has since been invited to Washington. European allies, meanwhile, remain wary, emphasizing the need for their involvement to ensure any potential peace agreement includes reliable security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Following a lengthy phone conversation with President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he will travel to Washington, D.C., for a meeting on Monday. The discussion, which also included European leaders, took place after the conclusion of the Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The upcoming meeting is intended to cover the details of ending the war, with Trump reportedly advising Zelenskyy to "make the deal." This development shifts the focus of diplomatic efforts to Washington, where the specifics of any potential peace framework will be negotiated directly between the Ukrainian and American leaders.</p>

          <p>A significant influx of Chinese investors is quietly reshaping the urban landscape of Athens, driven primarily by Greece's investor residency scheme, known as the "golden visa." Chinese citizens constitute the largest group of participants, accounting for nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60% of renewals by purchasing local property. This trend has led to thousands of apartments in the Greek capital being bought by Chinese nationals seeking residency in the European Union. The data from Greece's Ministry of Migration and Asylum highlights the profound and growing economic influence of Chinese investment within the country's real estate market.</p>

          <p>Despite high expectations and elaborate staging, the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a tangible agreement to end the war in Ukraine. Following less than three hours of talks, Trump stated that while "great progress" was made, "we didn't get there." Putin indicated that the root causes of the conflict must be addressed, signaling no change in his long-standing demands, which are unacceptable to Kyiv. The lack of a breakthrough leaves the path to peace uncertain, with President Trump now set to discuss the situation with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in Washington.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are voicing increasing concerns about the sustainability of the expanding U.S. national debt, leading to calls for Beijing to gradually reduce its holdings of American Treasury bonds. China has already been trimming its exposure, with its holdings currently at the lowest level since 2009. The article from a central bank-supervised publication suggests that while a default is not imminent, the current trajectory of U.S. debt is unsustainable. The researchers recommend that China should continue to adjust its reserves, potentially increasing its holdings of gold and other strategic resources to mitigate long-term financial risks.

          <p>According to this analysis, the summit in Alaska was a significant propaganda victory for Vladimir Putin, who received a red-carpet welcome on the world stage without having to concede to a ceasefire in Ukraine. The article argues that President Trump is a clear loser, having appeared to gain nothing in return while providing the Russian leader with legitimacy and a global platform. For Ukrainians, the outcome is seen as a major setback, as it means the conflict continues with no immediate prospect of relief. The meeting is framed as a failure of American diplomacy that leaves Ukraine and its European allies in a more isolated and vulnerable position.</p>

This dynamic suggests Putin successfully manipulated the summit to gain international legitimacy and a propaganda win without making any concessions.

          <p>Taiwan's government is planning to implement stricter residency regulations for mainland Chinese nationals, a move that is being described as an "attack" by critics. The proposed changes, part of a strategy to counter perceived threats from Beijing, would require applicants to provide notarized proof that they have relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. President Lai Ching-te's administration argues the policy is necessary to eliminate dual-status ambiguities that could pose national security risks amid escalating cross-strait tensions. The new rules represent a significant shift in residency governance and underscore a hardening stance towards mainland China.</p>
