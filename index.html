          <p>This article introduces an interactive BBC tool allowing users to compare their local weather with forecasts from cities worldwide, tapping into Britain's national pastime of discussing the weather. It invites users to discover if their region truly experiences less sunshine than other global locations. The feature aims to provide a fun, engaging way for people to explore meteorological data and perhaps even feel like a weather expert. This light-hearted approach makes weather comparison an entertaining activity for a broad audience.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a disappointing 5-1 walk-off loss to the San Francisco Giants, despite a stellar seven-inning, one-run performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The Giants, who have surged back into playoff contention, secured the win with Patrick Bailey's grand slam in the 10th inning. The Dodgers' offense, which had shown signs of improvement, failed to provide meaningful support, leaving runners stranded and struggling against Giants pitching. This defeat highlights a concerning lack of offensive consistency for the Dodgers as the playoffs approach.</p>

          <p>New, previously unreleased CCTV footage shows the last recorded sighting of British woman Sarm Heslop before her disappearance from a luxury yacht in the US Virgin Islands in March 2021. The footage reveals an inconsistency in the timeline provided by her boyfriend, Ryan Bane, who remains the sole person of interest. Bane claims Heslop likely fell overboard, but his delayed report to the coastguard and refusal to allow a forensic search of his yacht have raised suspicions. Heslop's family and friends continue to seek answers, hoping the case will be reclassified as a no-body murder investigation.</p>

          <p>NATO is deploying additional troops and fighter jets to its eastern flank in response to an unprecedented incursion of 19 Russian drones into Polish airspace. Denmark, France, and Germany are contributing to a new mission, with other allies expected to join. This move follows heightened political tensions and comes as Russia paused peace talks with Ukraine. Polish and European leaders believe the drone incursion was deliberate, despite Russia's denial of targeting Polish facilities. The United States has reaffirmed its commitment to defending every inch of NATO territory.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck early Saturday near the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter 111.7 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, at a depth of 39 kilometers. Initially, the Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a brief threat, which was quickly downgraded to no tsunami warning. There were no immediate reports of injuries or significant damage, providing some relief in the aftermath of the strong seismic event in the geologically active region.</p>

Researchers analyzed two decades of health data from over 66,000 American nurses, finding a 41% increased CVD risk for stalking victims and a 70% increase for those with restraining orders. This association persisted even after accounting for other health factors.

          <p>In the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, AI tools like X's Grok chatbot rapidly spread false claims, conspiracy theories, and misidentified the suspect. Grok generated contradictory information about the shooter and incorrectly stated Kirk was alive, even producing altered images. Experts note that generative AI, based on probability, struggles with real-time factual accuracy, leading to the dissemination of misinformation. This incident highlights the dangers of AI in information vacuums and how people tend to trust machines more than unknown human sources, exacerbating the spread of unverified content.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how conservative activist Charlie Kirk significantly contributed to Donald Trump's electoral success by mobilizing younger voters, a demographic traditionally dominated by Democrats. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, focused on social media outreach and persuaded an older generation to invest in youth engagement. His ability to project strength and engage in direct debates resonated with young men, leading to Trump's improved performance among voters under 30 in the 2024 election. The article highlights Kirk's strategic efforts, including the 'Ballot Chasers' program, which helped organize low-propensity Trump supporters in battleground states.</p>

          <p>New analysis by Policy in Practice suggests seven million UK households are missing out on an estimated £24 billion in unclaimed benefits and social tariffs for 2025-26. The report identifies awareness, complexity, and stigma as the primary barriers preventing people from claiming crucial financial help, including universal credit, pension credit, and local authority support. While some progress is noted in areas like pension credit claims, the overall figure for unclaimed support continues to rise. The government emphasizes public campaigns and free services, but critics argue the system remains too complicated.</p>

          <p>At least 193 people have died and scores are missing after two separate boat accidents occurred this week in the Democratic Republic of Congo's northwestern Equateur province. One boat, carrying nearly 500 passengers, capsized and caught fire on the Congo River, with 146 still unaccounted for. Another motorized boat, overloaded and navigating at night, capsized, killing 86 people, mostly students. These frequent accidents in Congo are often attributed to poorly maintained, overloaded vessels and journeys conducted at night, hindering rescue efforts and highlighting the urgent need for improved safety measures in river transport.</p>
