        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new book, former President Donald Trump told donors he had threatened to "bomb the s--- out of Moscow" if Russia invaded Ukraine. The claims, reportedly from an audio recording of a May 2024 donor meeting, also include a similar threat made to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding Taiwan. The Kremlin responded by stating they could not confirm or deny the report, acknowledging the prevalence of "fake news." This account highlights Trump's candid and aggressive rhetoric in private settings concerning foreign policy and his approach to international deterrence.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has initiated its annual Han Kuang military drills, which are the largest and longest in its history, lasting for ten days. These exercises are designed to test the island's defense capabilities against a potential invasion from China, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province. The drills incorporate urban resilience tests for the first time, such as using supermarkets for air-raid shelter practice and mobile apps for evacuation procedures. The heightened maneuvers reflect escalating cross-strait tensions following recent rhetoric from both Taiwanese and Chinese officials.</p>

          <p>In the current financial climate of anticipated interest rate cuts, savers are strategically comparing savings vehicles for large deposits like $10,000. An analysis shows that money market accounts currently offer slightly higher theoretical returns over various terms (18 months to 5 years) compared to long-term CDs. However, money market rates are variable and likely to decrease, while CD rates are fixed, offering a guaranteed return. Therefore, risk-averse savers may still prefer the security of a long-term CD despite the potentially lower earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's recent term was dominated by emergency appeals from the Trump administration, bringing its "shadow docket" into the spotlight. Despite a recent ruling to curb the use of nationwide injunctions, the court is expected to continue facing a high volume of urgent requests for intervention. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, even suggested the court should play a more active role in providing nationally uniform answers on an interim basis for major federal policies. Legal experts believe that while the ruling changes the landscape, litigants may find workarounds, ensuring the emergency docket remains a key battleground.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country over the Fourth of July weekend have resulted in at least 120 deaths, with many still missing. The disaster was caused by a confluence of factors, including the region's natural flood-prone geography and a massive weather system that dumped extreme rainfall while many were asleep. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the adequacy and timing of emergency warnings and evacuation orders, with some survivors stating they received no alerts. The tragedy has highlighted challenges in forecasting such extreme events and communicating risks effectively to the public.</p>

          <p>The removal of Christian Horner as Red Bull's team principal, while seemingly abrupt, is the culmination of at least 18 months of internal strife and declining performance. His departure follows a period marked by a power struggle with Helmut Marko, the resignation of key technical staff like Adrian Newey, and questions over driver management. Allegations of misconduct against Horner, though he was cleared internally, added to the instability. With star driver Max Verstappen's future uncertain and the team's competitive edge slipping, Horner's exit appears to be a move to stabilize the reigning world champions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California's Department of Education, alleging its policies on transgender athletes violate federal civil rights law. The complaint argues that allowing transgender girls to compete in girls' sports forces female athletes to compete against biological boys, creating a hostile environment and denying them equal opportunities under Title IX. The lawsuit follows threats of legal action from the Trump administration, which has criticized a California Interscholastic Foundation bylaw that allows students to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity. This legal challenge marks a significant escalation in the administration's focus on transgender issues in sports.</p>

However, the advance has been slow and costly, with Ukrainian forces offering fierce resistance and bogging down Russian troops in border villages.

Moran, a MacArthur Fellow, was instrumental in hosting numerous performances and educational programs, including the NEA Jazz Masters Tribute Concert.

          <p>Tim Leiweke, the CEO of venue management company Oak View Group, has been indicted on a federal criminal conspiracy charge for his alleged role in rigging the bid for a new University of Texas basketball arena. The indictment accuses Leiweke of conspiring with a competitor to have them drop their bid for the $338 million Moody Center project in exchange for lucrative sub-contracts, a promise he allegedly later broke. As part of the investigation, Oak View Group and Legends Hospitality are expected to enter non-prosecution agreements and pay penalties totaling $16.5 million, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>

Markarova had been criticized by some leading Republicans, and her departure was reportedly discussed in a recent call between Zelenskyy and Trump. The move comes at a critical time in the war, coinciding with Russia's largest aerial attack to date and a U.S. announcement that it would restart some weapon deliveries to Kyiv.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump makes significant changes to the federal student loan system that could make college more expensive for many. The law eliminates several repayment programs, including the income-driven SAVE plan, and replaces them with fewer, potentially more costly options. It also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees that may not cover the full cost of attendance, potentially pushing students toward private loans with higher interest rates. Critics argue these changes will make higher education harder to access, particularly for lower-income students and those pursuing advanced degrees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. has recorded 1,288 measles cases this year, the highest number since 1992, with the virus now confirmed in 38 states. The spread is raising concerns as summer camps and family travel create new opportunities for transmission, prompting the CDC to issue guidance for camps to verify campers' vaccination status. This resurgence occurs amid declining childhood vaccination rates and what some experts describe as a more lax approach to promoting vaccination from the Trump administration. Experts stress that the MMR vaccine is the most effective protection against the highly contagious and dangerous virus, which has already caused three deaths this year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has corrected a significant data error, revealing that international student enrollment in the U.S. grew by 6.5% last year, not declined as previously reported. An analysis flagged that the agency's initial data underreported the number of students by over 200,000. The revised figures from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) now show a total of 1,294,231 overseas students, aligning with other data sources that indicated robust growth.

The Greek-operated vessel, Eternity C, sank after being hit by rocket-propelled grenades, resulting in at least three deaths among the 25-person crew; six were rescued while others remain missing. The Iran-backed group claimed the attack, stating the ship was heading to Israel. This follows the sinking of the Magic Seas days earlier, marking a resurgence of Houthi attacks after a period of relative calm and drawing condemnation from the U.S. and maritime organizations.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned the conviction of Douglass Mackey, a right-wing influencer convicted of conspiring to suppress Democratic votes in the 2016 presidential election. Mackey was sentenced to seven months in prison for creating and sharing memes that falsely told Hillary Clinton supporters they could vote via text message. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence was insufficient to prove Mackey had entered into an agreement with others to interfere with voting rights, a key element of the conspiracy charge. The court found no evidence that anyone was actually tricked into not voting properly by the memes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's stated intention to name a "shadow chair" for the Federal Reserve long before Jerome Powell's term ends is raising concerns about the central bank's political independence. This strategy, aimed at pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates to lower government debt-servicing costs, could undermine the credibility of the eventual nominee. Analysts worry that the next Fed chair may be perceived as being chosen solely to enact the president's political agenda rather than to pursue the Fed's dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment.
