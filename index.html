          <p>Scottish Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency from the SNP in a closely contested by-election following the death of SNP MSP Christina McKelvie. Russell secured 8,559 votes, surpassing the SNP by 602 votes, marking a significant victory for Labour and a setback for the SNP, who had held the seat since 2011. The result reflects a shift in voter sentiment and prompts the SNP to reassess their strategies for future elections, with Scottish Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson stating the SNP would need to "look very closely" at the result and "learn the lessons" for the Holyrood elections. Reform UK finished third, with the Tories in fourth, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer congratulated Russell, saying people in Scotland have once again voted for change.</p>

The decision to terminate his contract, which was originally set to last four years, comes two years to the day after his appointment. Thomas Frank, manager of Brentford, is among the leading candidates to replace Postecoglou, with other names like Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva, Oliver Glasner, and Mauricio Pochettino also being considered.</p>

Meanwhile, Musk's father, Errol Musk, urged his son to end the feud, believing Trump will ultimately prevail, and attributed Musk's actions to stress. The White House characterized the feud as an unfortunate episode stemming from Musk's opposition to Trump's signature tax and immigration bill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film "Dangerous Animals" is a shark horror film directed by Sean Byrne, starring Hassie Harrison as Zephyr, a surfer who is kidnapped by a boat captain, Tucker, played by Jai Courtney. Tucker ties Zephyr and another woman to a crane and dangles them in the water for sharks to devour, filming their final moments. The film draws from serial-killer thriller and Hollywoodâ€™s penchant for survival stories about sharks feasting on human flesh. The film is deemed a disappointment because it doesn't provide any surprises or unexpected thematic depth.</p>

The report by BDO states that in the 2021 financial year, "dominant personalities and a weak control environment facilitated opportunities to commit fraud." There were "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers, as well as a culture that "did not challenge" financial transactions. This relates to the union spending Â£112m on building a hotel and conference center in Birmingham, which has since been valued at a fraction of that sum.</p>
