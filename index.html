          <p>In an interview, former President Donald Trump indicated he might consider an executive order to rename soccer to football in the United States, aligning with global terminology. The comments were made during the FIFA Club World Cup final, where Trump made a surprise appearance on stage with the winning team, Chelsea. He praised the sport's unifying quality, describing it as being about "love" between countries and a force that can bring the world together. The discussion comes as the U.S. prepares to co-host the FIFA World Cup next year, further cementing the sport's presence in the country.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Receives Trump Administration Approval to Sell Advanced AI Chips to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:14:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the Trump administration has approved the company's request to sell its advanced H20 AI computer chips to China, reversing a previous ban. The decision is a significant policy shift, aimed at allowing U.S. companies to compete in the vast Chinese market, which is home to half of the world's AI researchers. While the move is expected to boost Nvidia's revenue, some Chinese analysts remain cautious, citing the Trump administration's history of abrupt policy changes. The development highlights the ongoing tension between U.S. national security concerns and the economic interests of American tech giants.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall has triggered severe flash flooding across parts of the Northeast, particularly impacting New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The extreme weather has submerged roadways, stranded vehicles, and disrupted public transportation, including parts of the New York City subway system. New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency, and officials in Westchester County, New York, conducted water rescues for motorists trapped in submerged cars. Some areas in Pennsylvania received over seven inches of rain in a few hours, leading to disaster declarations and significant property damage, though no injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The steep price is largely due to India's high import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against competitors like BMW rather than the mass market. Analysts suggest Tesla is currently "testing the waters" and building its brand presence with new showrooms in Mumbai and New Delhi, rather than aiming for high sales volumes. A larger commitment to local manufacturing, which could lower prices, is not expected until India's EV market and policies mature further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from a government adviser has found a significant increase in antisemitism across the UK since the October 7 Hamas attack, particularly in workplaces like the NHS. The findings indicate that Jewish employees are often ostracized and held accountable for events in the Middle East, and some Jewish patients feel uneasy using health services. The report offers ten recommendations, focusing heavily on education and training to combat antisemitic tropes and ensure protections are applied equally to Jewish people. It calls for a formal "Antisemitism Training Qualification" and better understanding of Judaism as both a religion and an ethnicity.</p>

After his arrest, Craig also allegedly tried to hire a fellow inmate to kill the lead investigator on the case. The defense has questioned the evidence and police bias. The case against Craig, who has pleaded not guilty, points to financial difficulties and an alleged affair as potential motives.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that the German state did not violate international law by allowing the U.S. to use its Ramstein air base for a 2012 drone strike in Yemen that killed civilians. The case was brought by two Yemeni men who lost family members in the attack, arguing that Germany held partial responsibility because the base was used to relay signals for the drone mission. While the court acknowledged Germany has an obligation to protect human rights abroad, it determined there was insufficient connection to German state authority in this instance. The ruling concludes a decade-long legal battle over German complicity in U.S. drone operations.</p>

          <p>The shares of dual-listed Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong are now at their smallest discount compared to their mainland-listed counterparts in nearly five years. This narrowing gap, tracked by a Hang Seng gauge, reflects stronger performance in the Hong Kong market, driven by global investors diversifying away from a weaker U.S. dollar. Additionally, mainland Chinese investors have been increasing their purchases of Hong Kong-listed H-shares, particularly in major tech companies poised to benefit from advances in artificial intelligence. Analysts remain positive on Hong Kong stocks due to their relatively low valuations and expected capital inflows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The expanded BRICS bloc is increasingly positioning itself as a geopolitical alternative to Western-led institutions like the G7, condemning coercive economic tactics and calling for de-dollarization. However, this opinion article argues that the bloc's ambitions are undermined by significant internal contradictions and diverging interests among its members, such as India's balancing act and Brazil's pragmatism. While BRICS has evolved from a simple acronym into a symbol of a multipolar world, it remains a loose strategic partnership rather than a formal alliance. The piece questions whether the group can overcome its internal fractures to become a coherent and effective institution of global power.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has issued a new directive aimed at strengthening its legal system to counter foreign sanctions and interference. The policy paper, released by the party's Central Committee, calls for refining China's judicial toolkit to better challenge trade and technology sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies. The guidance emphasizes the need to establish an advanced system for understanding and engaging with foreign law. This move is part of Beijing's broader strategy to sharpen its legal tools and protect its national interests in the face of escalating international economic and political pressure.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," due to their extreme persistence in the environment. These toxic chemicals, found in products from non-stick pans to waterproof clothing, have been linked to serious health issues, including cancer and liver damage. The report highlights a recent court case in Italy and historical incidents in the U.S. where industrial contamination affected hundreds of thousands of people. Despite growing awareness and some regulatory action in Europe and the U.S., PFAS contamination remains a widespread global problem, with the chemicals now detectable in nearly all humans.</p>

          <p>China's voluntary health insurance program for urban and rural residents saw another significant decline in enrollment, with 15.8 million fewer people participating in 2024 compared to the previous year. This ongoing trend is driven by rising premiums and stagnating incomes, which place a heavy financial burden on many families, particularly in rural areas. The decline in participation is putting increasing pressure on the national healthcare system, which also includes a separate program for urban employees.

A fellow disciple described the church, where Marten spent four months as a teenager, as a "place of torture" and abuse, though there is no indication Marten herself was abused. The report details how Marten later expressed confusion and distress over her experience in private messages, even attempting to make a documentary about the church's cult-like environment.
