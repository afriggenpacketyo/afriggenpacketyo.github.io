          <p>Financial experts are advising car buyers to follow the "20-4-10" rule to ensure their vehicle purchase is affordable and to avoid owing more than the car is worth. This guideline suggests making a 20% down payment, financing the car for no more than four years, and keeping total monthly transportation costs under 10% of one's income. While acknowledging that high car prices can make these targets difficult to meet, planners emphasize that adhering to this framework helps prioritize saving for appreciating assets over depreciating ones like vehicles.

          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming book, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris recounts a phone call from then-President Joe Biden just before her pivotal debate with Donald Trump that left her feeling "angry and disappointed." Biden reportedly called to warn her about losing support from "power brokers in Philly" and then discussed his own past debate performances, which Harris perceived as self-centered and distracting. The book sheds light on the underlying tensions within the Democratic party during the transition of leadership and reveals other campaign details, such as her initial preference for Pete Buttigieg as a running mate.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City have resulted in at least 14 fatalities overnight, according to Palestinian health officials. One strike hit a family home, killing six relatives of a local hospital director, while another killed five people near a public square. The attacks come as Israel intensifies its military offensive in the area, urging hundreds of thousands of residents to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone in the south. Aid organizations have warned this will worsen the ongoing humanitarian crisis, with the death toll in Gaza now exceeding 65,100 since the conflict began.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man in connection with a drive-by shooting that targeted the ABC10 television station building. The incident occurred Friday afternoon when multiple rounds were fired at the building, striking a window but causing no injuries. Authorities identified the suspect after locating the vehicle involved and arrested him on charges including assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an occupied building. The motive remains under investigation, and the act of violence against journalists has been condemned by public officials, including California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to initial speculation on social media that the killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was a far-right extremist, newly filed charging documents suggest a different motive. Evidence, including the suspect's mother's testimony and his own text messages, indicates he identified with left-leaning politics and was critical of Kirk for spreading "hate," particularly regarding LGBTQ+ rights. The article explores how the initial, unsubstantiated narrative took hold in some progressive circles, highlighting the tendency to favor information that confirms pre-existing biases.

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a thought-provoking paradigm for understanding the competitive dynamics between the United States and China. He contrasts America's "lawyerly society," governed by procedural experts, with China's "engineering state," dominated by builders and planners, to explain their differing paths of development and stagnation. Wang argues that while China's approach has led to rapid infrastructure and manufacturing growth, it has also stifled individual freedoms and service-sector jobs. He posits that despite their differences, both nations could benefit by learning from each other's successes and failures in the current geopolitical climate.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of aviation software, has caused widespread disruption and delays at several key European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the company's Muse software, which manages electronic check-in and baggage systems for multiple airlines, forced airport staff to resort to manual processing. This resulted in long queues, flight delays, and some cancellations as airports struggled to manage passenger flow. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected global aviation industry to digital threats and the cascading effects a single system failure can have.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who recently announced his retirement, is being celebrated as the central figure in the revival of the Los Angeles Dodgers franchise.

He guided the team from a 20-year postseason series drought to becoming a perennial contender, culminating in multiple championships.

          <p>Syria is preparing for its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad dictatorship, but the process is complex, indirect, and controversial. Instead of a public vote, an "electoral college" of 6,000 to 7,000 individuals, appointed by election sub-committees, will choose 121 members of the new People's Assembly. While the process includes provisions for diversity and excludes former regime loyalists, critics argue it gives excessive power to the interim president, who will directly appoint another 70 members. Minority groups and civil society organizations have raised concerns that the system is a way to legitimize the transitional government without genuine democratic consensus.</p>

          <h2>Pentagon to Require Journalists to Sign Pledge Restricting Information Gathering</h2>

          <p>The Pentagon is set to implement a significant change in its media policy, requiring journalists to sign a pledge agreeing not to gather any information that has not been officially authorized for release. This new rule applies even to unclassified reports and materials. According to U.S. officials, journalists who refuse to sign the pledge or violate its terms will have their press credentials revoked. This would effectively cut off their access to the headquarters of the Department of Defense, a move that drastically alters the established norms of press coverage for the U.S. military and raises concerns about transparency and government oversight.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The administration cited a need to prevent "abuse" of the program, stating that companies must now decide if a foreign worker is valuable enough to justify the steep cost or if they should hire an American instead. The move has been met with alarm from immigration lawyers and business groups, who warn it will cripple small businesses and startups, price out essential talent, and harm American competitiveness in the tech sector and other industries.

          <p>A large-scale memorial service for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk is scheduled for Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance set to deliver remarks. The event, expected to draw tens of thousands, will honor Kirk, who was fatally shot on a university campus last week. Kirk, a key ally of the administration, will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The service takes place amid a charged political atmosphere, as the administration has used Kirk's death to vow a crackdown on groups it labels as contributing to political violence.</p>

          <p>Major cities across Germany, including Berlin and Cologne, are bracing for a weekend of large-scale demonstrations centered on two contentious issues: climate change and abortion. The student activist group "Fridays for Future" has called for nationwide rallies demanding an end to fossil fuel use, criticizing the government's recent decision to build new gas-fired power plants. Simultaneously, anti-abortion groups are organizing "March for Life" protests, which are expected to be met with significant counter-protests. The dual demonstrations highlight the deep social and political divisions within the country on key environmental and social policies.</p>

          <p>Starbucks employees in Illinois and Colorado have filed class-action lawsuits against the company, alleging that a new, stricter dress code forced them to purchase new clothing without reimbursement, violating state labor laws. The updated policy, implemented in May, requires specific solid-colored shirts and bottoms, which workers claim went beyond the two free shirts provided by the company. Employees in California have filed similar complaints with the state's labor agency. The baristas argue that it is unfair for a multi-billion-dollar corporation to place the financial burden of a uniform change on its workers, many of whom are already struggling with low pay.</p>

          <p>The death of a rare pygmy sperm whale off the coast of Honduras is highlighting the lethal impact of plastic pollution on marine life. Researchers found the young whale in distress after it repeatedly beached itself; a subsequent necropsy revealed an 11-inch plastic bag blocking its digestive system. The incident is particularly concerning because pygmy sperm whales are elusive and rarely sighted, making the loss of even a single animal significant for the species. This tragic event serves as a stark reminder of the widespread danger that single-use plastics pose to ocean ecosystems, killing countless marine mammals and seabirds annually.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Psychology of Limerence and How to Overcome Romantic Obsession</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," explores the psychological state of "limerence," an intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and extreme emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while limerence is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of addiction when the object of affection is unavailable or unreliable, leading to anxiety and craving. To break free, he recommends strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and focusing on new personal goals. This approach helps shift the brain's reward system away from the unhealthy obsession and toward self-improvement.</p>

          <p>U.S. water and wastewater treatment facilities are facing an increasing number of severe cyberattacks from foreign adversaries, including Iran, Russia, and China. With over 50,000 public water systems nationwide, many are antiquated, underfunded, and lack the cybersecurity expertise to defend against sophisticated hackers who could disrupt clean water supplies. In response, a new volunteer initiative, Project Franklin, is pairing cybersecurity experts with small-town water operators to help them secure their systems. The effort aims to raise awareness and implement basic defenses against threats that could have devastating consequences for public health and safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a successful general election campaign that surpassed expectations, the UK's Liberal Democrat party is now grappling with its future direction and how to build on its momentum. While leader Sir Ed Davey's playful and often-mocked stunts garnered significant media attention, polling suggests voters may now want the party to adopt a more serious tone. The party's immediate focus is on solidifying its gains in newly won seats, primarily in southern England, by embedding MPs in their local communities. However, to expand its appeal, the party must now develop a broader policy platform, particularly on the economy, and find a way to make its moderate positions exciting to voters.</p>
