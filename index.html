          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was tested as Israeli forces launched deadly strikes, stating they were responding to a Hamas attack that killed two of its soldiers. In response, Israel hit multiple targets and temporarily halted aid deliveries into the territory, though they were later scheduled to resume. Hamas denied involvement in the clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire agreement and claiming it had lost contact with its groups in the area. The escalation resulted in at least 38 reported deaths in Gaza, creating significant uncertainty about the stability of the recent peace efforts.</p>

This move is part of Germany's significant expansion of its defense budget in response to the perceived threat of Russian aggression, with the jets intended to replace the country's aging Tornado fleet. In a separate development, the far-right AfD party has proposed making U.S. President Donald Trump an honorary citizen of the district where his grandparents were born, citing his role in the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>France's justice minister stated that security measures "failed" during a brazen, broad-daylight jewelry heist at the Louvre museum, creating a "terrible image" for the country. Thieves used power tools and a vehicle-mounted lift to steal eight priceless items, including a diamond and emerald necklace Napoleon gave to his wife, before escaping on scooters. Experts have warned that there is a race against time to catch the thieves, as fears grow that the historic jewels will be quickly broken apart, melted down, and smuggled out of the country.</p>

The event is being held under noticeably tightened security conditions in Beijing. Reports indicate a heavier-than-usual presence of traffic police and multiple police vehicles stationed around the Jingxi Hotel, a traditional venue for these high-level party sessions. A section of the road near the hotel entrance was also observed to be cordoned off, underscoring the importance and sensitivity of the gathering.</p>

          <p>In her posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," Virginia Giuffre reveals she feared she might "die a sex slave" while being subjected to sadistic abuse by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. The book, obtained by the BBC before its official release, details a web of powerful people involved in the abuse of young women and reiterates her allegations of having sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions. The publication places further scrutiny on the prince, who recently announced he would voluntarily stop using his royal titles amid the ongoing controversy.</p>

          <p>UK Housing Secretary Steve Reed has declared that his job should be "on the line" over the government's pledge to build 1.5 million new homes in England during the current Parliament. However, his bold commitment is met with significant skepticism from leading industry experts. Both a former government planning adviser and the Home Builders Federation have warned that the target is "looking increasingly distant" and that there is "absolutely no way" it will be met, citing a cumbersome planning process and flatlining construction rates.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments regarding the legality of former Trump lawyer Alina Habba's position as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. A lower court judge had previously ruled that her appointment was achieved through a "novel series of legal and personnel moves" and that she was not lawfully serving, a decision that could void her actions since July. The Justice Department is appealing that ruling, arguing her appointment is valid under federal statute, in a case that raises significant questions about prosecutorial authority.</p>

          <p>In remarks to a high-level committee at the International Monetary Fund, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves explicitly linked the 2020 Brexit deal to the country's ongoing economic struggles. She stated that the UK's productivity challenge has been "compounded by the way in which the UK left the European Union," citing the official forecast of a 4% long-term hit to the economy. This represents a notable change in the government's public messaging and is expected to be a key argument in the lead-up to the November Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 4.8% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, a figure that met analyst expectations but marked the slowest pace in a year. More concerning, however, was an unexpected 0.5% contraction in fixed-asset investment for the first nine months of the year, a drop described by one economist as "rare and alarming." This decline was driven by a persistent slump in the property sector and slowing infrastructure spending, signaling significant downward pressure on future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The recommendation to introduce peanut products to infants as early as four months old, which upended previous advice to delay exposure, is credited with preventing an estimated 60,000 children from developing life-threatening peanut allergies. Researchers found that peanut allergies in young children declined by over 40% after the new guidelines were fully implemented.</p>

This protein variant, also found in humans, appears to contribute to the rodent's ability to live up to 37 years, an exceptional lifespan for a mammal of its size. The findings, published in the journal Science, provide a molecular basis for this longevity and could inspire new therapeutic strategies for anti-aging and improving human health.</p>
