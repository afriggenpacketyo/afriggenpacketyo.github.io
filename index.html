          <p>Through a personal audio diary, a 28-year-old teacher named Hanya Aljamal shares her daily experience of living through the war in Gaza. Displaced multiple times and now living with her family in a small apartment, she describes the psychological toll of constant explosions, drone surveillance, and the loss of her former life and purpose. She reflects on small acts of hope, like a neighbor gardening amidst the ruins, but also the profound grief of losing students, colleagues, and a cousin killed while seeking aid.

          <p>An article from the BBC explores the complex issue of youth vaping addiction through the story of a mother, "Emma," who now buys vapes for her teenage children. She does this to control their nicotine intake and ensure the products are from reputable sources, despite knowing it is illegal. The piece discusses the limited impact of the UK's recent disposable vape ban, as experts note that legal, rechargeable vapes are still being marketed to children. A pediatric addiction specialist highlights the severity of the issue, with some youths experiencing "micro withdrawals" during school, underscoring the need for more support services.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have resulted in at least 72 fatalities, including civilians and children in displaced persons' shelters and residential areas. The attacks occurred as President Trump indicated a potential ceasefire agreement with Hamas could be reached within the next week, although neither side has publicly confirmed this. The article notes that ongoing negotiations for a pause in fighting have been challenging, with a recent proposal involving a hostage and prisoner exchange being met with an "unacceptable" response from Hamas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists studying a distant galaxy cluster have discovered ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, challenges previous timelines for cosmic events, suggesting that processes like supermassive black hole activity or cosmic particle collisions were energizing galaxies much earlier in the universe's history than previously thought. The finding opens a new window into understanding the evolution and formation of early galaxy clusters.</p>

The ceremonies honored figures like Gen. Hossein Salami and Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, who were among the more than 30 commanders and 11 scientists Israel claims to have killed. The conflict, which Israel stated was to destroy Iran's nuclear program, also resulted in over 1,000 deaths in Iran. In a recent interview, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog confirmed "very, very, very considerable" damage to Iran's Fordo facility but noted the country could resume enrichment within months.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 9-5 to the Kansas City Royals, Shohei Ohtani delivered his most impressive pitching performance of the season. In a limited two-inning start as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani showcased dominant velocity, including a career-hardest 101.7-mph fastball that induced an inning-ending double play. He threw 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and retired the side in the second inning, demonstrating the potent combination of speed and breaking pitches that defines his two-way talent. While the Dodgers' bullpen struggled after his departure, Ohtani's outing was an encouraging sign for his continued recovery and contribution on the mound.</p>

Several provisions also had to be rewritten to comply with Senate budget rules. With a slim majority, Republicans can only afford to lose three votes, making the positions of undecided senators critical for its passage. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the U.S. maintains a clear and significant lead in semiconductor production, a gap that will take years to close. However, he highlighted that China is making significant strides in algorithm engineering, citing the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. models using far less computing power.

Although she did not see what bit her, experts who examined photos of the wounds concluded the bites were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark.

          <p>The UK government has strongly condemned the rap-punk duo Bob Vylan for leading chants of "death to the IDF" during their set at the Glastonbury Festival, which was broadcast live by the BBC. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has demanded an explanation from the BBC, which called the comments "deeply offensive" and confirmed the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service. The incident, along with a politically charged set by the band Kneecap, has prompted police to review footage for potential criminal offenses. The government has also announced its intention to proscribe Palestine Action, a group supported by the artists, as a terrorist organization.</p>

The bill also proposes a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling and includes deep cuts to Medicaid, such as work requirements, which remain a point of contention.

          <p>A mudslide triggered by heavy rains caused a major traffic standstill on the West Virginia Turnpike, leaving thousands of motorists stranded for more than eight hours overnight. The slide blocked a storm drain, flooding the northbound lanes and backing up traffic for 12 miles. The West Virginia Parkways Authority has taken full responsibility for the incident, admitting it failed to reroute traffic and promising to revise its emergency procedures. No injuries were reported, but stranded drivers expressed frustration over the lack of information and resources during the lengthy ordeal on the rural highway.</p>

A key procedural ruling also reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a win for the Trump administration.

Researchers studied DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that while early burials were of family members, later burials showed genetic connections primarily through the female line. This indicates a matrilocal system, where husbands moved into their wives' households. The findings are supported by the discovery of more grave goods with female skeletons, challenging Western-biased assumptions about ancient social structures being universally patrilineal.</p>

          <p>Belfast rap group Kneecap performed a highly-charged set at Glastonbury, drawing thousands of supporters and hitting back at UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who had called their appearance "inappropriate." The band's performance was politically loaded, with chants of "free, free Palestine" and criticism of UK arms sales to Israel. The appearance was controversial due to one member, Mo Chara, facing a terrorism charge for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a previous gig, a charge he denies. Glastonbury organizers defended their decision to host the band, emphasizing the festival's role as a platform for diverse artistic expression.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of U.S. military veterans and their family members are being detained or deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump administration's intensified enforcement. The article highlights several cases, including the deportation of a stateless man born on a U.S. army base to a veteran father, and the detention of the wife of a Marine Corps veteran. This trend is occurring as ICE has been pressed to increase its daily arrests, leading to a significant rise in the detention of individuals with no criminal record. The actions have been described by those affected as a betrayal of their service to the country.</p>

          <p>A massive crowd, estimated by organizers at a record 200,000 people, participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying legal threats from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a police ban issued under a controversial "child protection" law that restricts gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with attendees facing potential fines. The march was a powerful display of solidarity from Hungary's LGBTQ community and its allies, including the EU equalities commissioner and dozens of MEPs who attended. Participants expressed their desire for a diverse and tolerant country in the face of mounting government pressure.</p>
