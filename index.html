          <p>The head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has expressed concerns about the radicalization of young people by far-right ideologies, leading to their involvement in serious crimes. This announcement follows a recent police crackdown on a far-right extremist cell with members as young as 14. Separately, train services at Hamburg's main station have returned to normal after a knife attack by a female suspect injured 18 people. The police do not believe there to be a political motive to the knife attack, but rather a state of mental distress. </p>

          <p>The NHS has announced plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to treat individuals in acute mental distress. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, has voiced skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and careful testing of the model before national implementation. A recent study highlighted that the number of people waiting 12 hours or more in A&E after a decision to admit them was at a record high. </p>

He emphasizes the importance of AI in bolstering information technology infrastructure and enhancing cybersecurity. Ha suggests that the U.S.'s focus on its own interests could make AI a bargaining chip, highlighting the need for Japan to develop its own capabilities. </p>

The reserve rice is expected to reach stores by June, addressing criticism that the government has failed to curb the rice price spike. Koizumi plans to bypass auctions to maintain government control over prices and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high, impacting households as inflation outpaces wage growth. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a blown save and pitching staff challenges to defeat the New York Mets in 13 innings. The game was further complicated by a rain delay and an overworked bullpen, which was already missing key members. Teoscar Hernández's RBI double in the 13th inning secured the win for the Dodgers, but the game's length and circumstances raised concerns about the pitching staff's condition. Despite the win, manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the need to protect the pitching staff in the coming days. </p>

Despite Germany's vigilance against revisionism and rise of the far-right AfD, much of the resistance feels hollow. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, which celebrates the legacy of an early SS supporter, highlights Germany's selective memory, with many wealthy families building their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labor. The government still refuses to pay reparations to the descendants of the Herero and Nama people, the primary victims of its genocide in Namibia. </p>
