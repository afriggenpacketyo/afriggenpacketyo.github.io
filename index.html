          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off around 1,800 domestic employees as part of a significant reorganization plan. This move follows a Supreme Court decision that allows the Trump administration to proceed with workforce reductions aimed at downsizing federal agencies. The plan, initiated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, intends to streamline operations by merging or eliminating over 300 bureaus and offices deemed redundant. The agency has expressed gratitude for the service of departing employees and will now focus on implementing what it calls "results-driven diplomacy."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl and its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products as reasons for the move. This represents a significant escalation from previous tariffs and is part of a broader strategy of imposing higher duties on numerous trading partners. Economists have expressed concern that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices and slower economic growth in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As China prepares to release its first-half economic data, analysts are closely monitoring for signs that more fiscal stimulus is needed to counter external pressures, particularly from U.S. trade policies. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% target, concerns remain about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and employment. Economists and central bank advisers have suggested that a more proactive fiscal policy may be necessary to navigate the challenges posed by the ongoing trade war. The upcoming GDP figures will be crucial in determining the government's next economic moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tense standoff occurred in Ventura County, California, between U.S. Border Patrol agents and protesters near a farm in Camarillo. The confrontation took place while agents were executing a warrant at what the Department of Homeland Security described as a marijuana facility. Federal agents reportedly used tear gas and less-than-lethal rounds to disperse the crowd, resulting in several injuries. The incident drew criticism from state officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which condemned the tactics as inhumane and fear-inducing amid broader federal immigration enforcement actions in the region.</p>

          <p>A recent survey suggests that the United States is becoming a less appealing travel destination for many Southeast Asians. According to the CNBC Travel poll, nearly 80% of respondents reported a decline in their interest in visiting the U.S., citing concerns over potential discrimination, gun violence, and the Trump administration's policies rather than cost. While interest remains higher among travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines, potentially due to large diaspora communities, Singaporeans showed the most significant drop in interest. The findings align with other reports showing a global decrease in positive impressions of the U.S. as a travel destination.</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have begun turning again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds in a dramatic accident. The occasion was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display in the Montmartre district. The original sails collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, but no one was injured. While new aluminum blades were installed before the Paris Olympics, delays in acquiring a new electric motor kept them stationary until now, marking the full restoration of the iconic landmark.</p>

          <p>Moon Tae-il, a former member of the K-Pop group NCT known as Taeil, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by a Seoul court. The sentence follows his guilty plea to charges of sexual assault against an intoxicated woman in 2024. Taeil and two other men were convicted of assaulting the woman, a Chinese tourist, after meeting her at a bar. The singer was removed from the popular music group in August 2024 after the allegations first surfaced. The court noted the grave nature of the crime but considered that the defendants were first-time offenders.</p>

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe, titled "Eight Words That Changed The World," claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans. After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages, he concluded that the words people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together are the most resonant with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. Bruni-Lowe describes these words as "emotional shortcuts" that serve as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging. The book also explores famous exceptions like "Make America Great Again" and notes the growing influence of AI in crafting voter-specific messages.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult novel "Trainspotting," is releasing a new sequel titled "Men in Love," which explores his famous characters' lives immediately after the original book's events. In a recent interview, Welsh expressed concern that modern society is becoming a "post-culture society," with artificial intelligence and social media creating "dumbed down machines." He fears that as machines think for us, human intellect atrophies. Welsh, who has always been political, also reflected on the social decay that inspired his work and argued that economic precarity now affects a much broader swath of the population.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, an opinion piece reflects on the world's recurring failure to prevent mass atrocities. The article highlights the story of a Srebrenica survivor and draws a parallel between the international community's inaction during the Bosnian war and the current crisis in Gaza. The author questions how many more times the world will witness such suffering, declare "never again," and only act after thousands have been killed. It calls for an end to the cycle of witnessing tragedy, followed by belated legal recognition and hollow promises, urging proactive intervention.</p>

The expansion follows Tesla's recent pilot program in Austin, Texas, where invited passengers ride in remotely supervised vehicles with a human safety monitor on board. The Austin pilot has encountered some issues, including a minor accident, drawing scrutiny from federal regulators as the company works to catch up in the autonomous vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing its third heatwave of a year that has already seen the warmest and sunniest spring on record. While some may dismiss the hot weather as "just summer," climate scientists warn that human-influenced global warming is making such extreme events more common and intense. Professor Ed Hawkins from Reading University notes that a 1°C rise in global average temperature can translate to heatwaves that are 3-4°C warmer in the UK. Analysis shows that what was once a rare event, like the 1976 heatwave, is now becoming a more regular feature of British summers.</p>

          <p>In an unusual trend, South Korea's fertility clinics are experiencing a business boom even as the country grapples with the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility treatments rose by nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022, and last year one in six babies in Seoul was born with assistance from such treatments. Experts attribute this to a generational shift, with more people choosing to delay parenthood for social and financial reasons and then turning to technology like IVF to start families later in life. This has contributed to a slight, first-in-nine-years increase in the national birth rate.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, indicates that the longest and rarest heat waves are showing the greatest increases in frequency, meaning each fraction of a degree of warming has a compounding impact. This acceleration poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in tropical regions. The scientists stress the urgent need for society to quicken its adaptation strategies to cope with these rapidly intensifying and enduring periods of extreme heat.</p>
