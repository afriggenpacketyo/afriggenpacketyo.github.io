          <p>Severe weather has caused catastrophic flash flooding in Texas's Kerr County, resulting in at least thirteen fatalities. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in under an hour, devastating property and leading to a large-scale emergency response. Authorities have confirmed that around 20 children from a local summer camp are unaccounted for, though they may just be out of communication. Rescue operations are extensive, involving hundreds of personnel with helicopters and drones, as the state grapples with the sudden and destructive natural disaster.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks has identified five food categories he avoids giving his own children. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease. The list also features sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins to foster long-term wellness.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team defeated India by a slim margin of five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball but fell short, ending at 166-5. Earlier, England posted a total of 171-9, driven by strong half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, before a sudden collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs. The thrilling conclusion sets up a crucial fourth match in the five-game series, with England now trailing 2-1.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal aimed at ending the conflict with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations to implement the framework, which is believed to include a 60-day truce. This development follows President Trump's announcement that Israel had agreed to the proposal, though Israeli officials have not publicly confirmed their commitment. The war, which began after the October 7, 2023 attacks, has resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis and tens of thousands of casualties in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Health advocates and policy experts are raising concerns that the wide variety of names for Medicaid programs across different states could lead to widespread confusion. Many beneficiaries may not realize they are enrolled in Medicaid because their state uses a unique brand name for the program. This lack of awareness poses a significant risk, as individuals might not respond to important notices about eligibility reviews or renewals. As a result, many people could inadvertently lose their health coverage without understanding that their state-specific plan is, in fact, part of the national Medicaid system.</p>

          <p>A new spending bill passed by Congress introduces a temporary tax deduction for seniors, but it does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits as some claims suggested. The legislation provides a new 'bonus' deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals over 65 with incomes below $75,000, which can lower their overall taxable income. However, policy experts clarify this is different from making Social Security benefits themselves tax-exempt. The relief measure, which expires in 2028, will primarily benefit higher-income seniors and does not alter the fundamental taxation structure of Social Security payments. (not investment advice)</p>

Salah wrote that he was 'truly lost for words' and that the news was 'extremely difficult to accept.' He expressed that the thought of returning to the team without Jota was frightening, a sentiment that underscores the profound impact of the tragedy on the club. Other players and associates also paid tribute, remembering Jota as a dedicated professional and a close friend who will be deeply missed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign a budget package that includes a new federal tax deduction for tipped workers, a provision he has championed. The measure allows workers in industries like food service and hospitality to deduct their tip income from their federal tax liability, though it does not affect state, local, or payroll taxes. Critics argue the tax break, which is set to expire in 2028, will not benefit the lowest-paid workers who often have no federal tax liability to begin with. The bill's final details vary between the House and Senate versions regarding income caps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Trump proposed holding a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebration next year. He suggested that an octagon could be set up to host a full fight card for an audience of 20,000 to 25,000 people. Trump mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the event. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major sporting event of this kind has been hosted at the White House.</p>

          <p>During trade negotiations in Washington, the Trump administration reportedly threatened to impose a 17% tariff on food and agricultural products imported from the European Union. This move would impact a wide range of popular European exports to the US, including chocolates, butter, and olive oil. The threat was communicated to the EU trade commissioner this week as part of ongoing, aggressive negotiations over a broader trade deal. While the EU remains hopeful for a negotiated solution, it is also preparing retaliatory measures if the U.S. proceeds with new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
