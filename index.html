          <p>An LAPD station in Pacoima was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in a box of military ordnance they discovered while cleaning a deceased relative's home. The bomb squad was called to the scene and used a robot to assess the devices before deeming them safe to transport. The explosives were moved to a secure facility for collection by the U.S. military. This incident occurred shortly after three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives were killed in a separate explosion involving ordnance.</p>

          <p>My Chemical Romance is currently on a major stadium tour, performing their iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety, a testament to their enduring influence on emo and rock music. The show at Dodger Stadium featured elaborate theatrical elements, including a narrative involving a fictional dictator, which served as a satirical take on political authoritarianism. The band's lasting appeal is attributed to its blend of dramatic world-building, frank lyrics about mental health, and a flexible portrayal of gender. The performance also included a set of other fan-favorite hits and a previously unreleased song.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his status as one of the sport's greats. Despite having the overall victory effectively secured, Pogačar characteristically launched an attack on the final stage in Paris, even on dangerously wet roads, finishing fourth for the stage but winning the tour overall. He finished 4 minutes and 24 seconds ahead of two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, continuing their multi-year rivalry at the top of the sport. Pogačar's victory marks another dominant year, having also won the Giro d'Italia earlier in the season.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese position player to be enshrined, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 99.7% of the vote. He was joined by six-time All-Star pitcher CC Sabathia and dominant reliever Billy Wagner in the 2025 class in Cooperstown. Suzuki, a 10-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner, is celebrated for his remarkable contact hitting, amassing over 3,000 hits in MLB after a storied career in Japan. The ceremony highlighted the profound and growing connection between Japanese and American baseball, a legacy Suzuki was instrumental in building.</p>

          <p>Several Eastern Caribbean nations, including Antigua and Barbuda, are experiencing a significant increase in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, where individuals can gain a passport by purchasing real estate. A large portion of this new interest is coming from US citizens, reportedly driven by political and social instability in the United States. These programs, which offer visa-free travel and tax advantages, are a major source of revenue for the islands but have drawn scrutiny from the EU and US over security and financial crime concerns. In response, the Caribbean nations are implementing stricter oversight and due diligence measures.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a major trade deal, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods imported into the US, averting a potential trade war. Announced by Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the agreement also includes significant EU commitments to purchase billions in US energy and invest in the American economy. While hailed for bringing stability, the deal is more complex than a simple tariff, with zero tariffs on some sectors like aircraft and a retained 50% tariff on steel. The agreement also raises diplomatic questions regarding its impact on Northern Ireland's unique trade status. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid concerns over pets being imported with significant health and behavioral issues. An investigation found that many dogs from countries like Romania are sold online with minimal vetting, arriving with infectious diseases such as Brucella canis, which can pass to humans. Owners have reported facing unexpected aggression and high vet bills, putting a strain on UK-based shelters that have to manage the fallout.

For the first 7.8 magnitude quake, only 469 high-level "Take Action" alerts were sent, when an estimated 10 million people were in the zone of intense shaking. The system's algorithms have since been updated, and a simulation showed the revised system would have sent 10 million alerts.

          <p>A regional train derailed near Riedlingen in southwestern Germany, resulting in at least three deaths and approximately 50 injuries, with 25 reported to be serious. The train was carrying around 100 passengers when at least two carriages went off the tracks in a forested area. While the exact cause is under investigation, authorities have not ruled out a landslide triggered by a heavy thunderstorm that had hit the region earlier in the evening. Emergency services responded to the scene, and many of the injured were transported to a nearby university hospital for treatment.</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses have defended their European Championship title, beating world champions Spain in a tense final that ended in a penalty shootout. The victory, described as one of the greatest achievements in English football history, marks the first time a senior England team has won a major trophy on foreign soil. Throughout the knockout stages, the team demonstrated remarkable resilience, winning all three matches in extra time, two via penalties, and leading for less than five minutes in total. Captain Leah Williamson acknowledged they "rode their luck" but were ultimately deserving champions who fought to the very end.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man has been charged with terrorism and assault with intent to murder after allegedly stabbing 11 people in a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The victims, who ranged in age from 21 to 84, all survived the random attack. When police arrived, several citizens, including one who was armed, were confronting the suspect in the parking lot, preventing further harm. Authorities stated that a terrorism charge was justified because the mass, random nature of the attack was intended to instill fear in the entire community, though a specific motive has not yet been determined.</p>

          <p>North Korea has officially rejected any peace overtures from South Korea's new liberal President Lee Jae Myung, calling them a "great miscalculation." In a statement attributed to Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, Pyongyang stated it has no interest in dialogue or proposals from Seoul. The statement argued that President Lee's commitment to the South Korea-U.S. security alliance shows he is no different from his more hostile predecessor. This response dashes cautious optimism in the South that a change in leadership might lead to renewed engagement between the two nations.</p>

Ang's comments suggest a concern about a potential decline in this dedicated expertise at a critical time in the relationship between the two global powers.

The author suggests that to capitalize on this, the region must create a low-carbon tourism corridor that links cities with clean and smart travel options.
