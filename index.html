          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing the need for intervention in the city. Simultaneously, a federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking Trump's attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. The judge stated that Portland's protests were not significantly violent or disruptive enough to warrant federal military deployment without the state's approval, emphasizing the importance of constitutional law over martial law and the state's sovereignty. This ruling underscores the ongoing legal and political battles over federal intervention in local affairs, with Oregon officials celebrating the decision as a "wake-up call" for the administration. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision to a higher court.</p>

          <p>US envoys, including Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, are traveling to Egypt for crucial ceasefire negotiations in Gaza, with President Trump expressing confidence that a deal is "very close." This development follows Hamas's indication of readiness to accept key aspects of Trump's peace proposal, which outlines terms for ending the war, Israeli withdrawal, and a significant hostage-prisoner exchange. Despite reports of continued Israeli strikes causing Palestinian casualties, Prime Minister Netanyahu has voiced hope for the return of all remaining hostages within days. These high-stakes talks aim to finalize the technical details for an agreement and establish a lasting cessation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>A maroon minivan believed to be the primary crime scene in the 2023 murder of Kenneth Fandrich in Hillsboro, Oregon, was discovered at a metal scrapyard. Detective Devin Rigo raced to retrieve the vehicle, hoping to find crucial forensic evidence. However, he arrived too late, learning the minivan had already been crushed and scrapped, a week after being towed from the side of I-5 where police believe the suspect, Steven Milner, dumped it. This article details the investigative challenges in securing evidence against Milner, who was charged with Fandrich's murder following a long-standing stalking history involving the victim's wife.</p>

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport reopened after its second drone-related closure in less than 24 hours, significantly impacting thousands of passengers and causing widespread delays. Two drones were sighted near runways late Friday, prompting authorities to shut down operations before the unidentified devices flew away. This incident is part of a series of mysterious drone overflights affecting airports and critical infrastructure across European Union member countries, including a brief closure at Lithuania's main airport due to possible balloon sightings. European authorities are concerned about the origin of these incidents, with some experts suspecting Russian involvement, though Moscow denies claims, leading to discussions on a "drone detection and defense plan."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales in the US, which saw battery cars account for 10% of sales in August, analysts warn that the country is significantly lagging behind other major markets like China and Europe in EV adoption. This recent boom was largely attributed to a government subsidy that has now expired, leading to expectations of a sharp drop in demand. Policy differences, including comparatively weaker government support and high tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, are cited as key factors hindering US progress. Carmakers are now grappling with pricing strategies to offset the loss of incentives and new tariffs, further complicating the market's future trajectory.</p>

          <p>A Missouri man was found dead from a likely bear attack at his campsite near Mt. Judea, Arkansas, just two days after sending photos of a bear to his family. Police discovered his body with extensive injuries consistent with a large carnivore attack, and signs of a struggle were evident at the scene. Search efforts are underway to locate the bear, which appeared to be a young male in the photos, though it's uncertain if it's the same animal responsible. This highly unusual incident, the second fatal bear attack in Arkansas in a month, has led to the temporary closure of the Sam's Throne campground, prompting warnings for public vigilance in the outdoors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, issuing a 14-day temporary restraining order. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's determination of chaos in Portland was "untethered to the facts" and that protests were not violent enough to justify deployment without the governor's approval. The judge emphasized the constitutional tradition against military intrusion into civil affairs, affirming Oregon's sovereignty and warning against blurring lines between civil and military power.

A draft design circulated online shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him pumping his fist after a near-assassination attempt, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight."

Switzerland alone has lost a quarter of its ice in the last decade, with some smaller glaciers, like Pizol, completely disappearing. Scientists confirm that the particularly rapid losses of the past 40 years are unequivocally linked to human-caused global warming.

          <p>Thousands of people participated in a banned Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, openly defying a police prohibition on LGBTQ+ rallies. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ultra-conservative Fidesz party passed a law allowing such bans, claiming the move was necessary to "protect children." Despite potential fines of up to €500, between 7,000 and 8,000 demonstrators, including several Members of the European Parliament, joined the rally in a show of solidarity. Protesters waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning Orban's government as a "dictatorship" and highlighting concerns about the restriction of fundamental human rights, echoing Amnesty International's warnings.</p>

Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds after the incident, which police described as an isolated fight between two men, not a random act of violence. The other man involved claimed Sanchez became aggressive over parking and defended himself with pepper spray before stabbing him. Sanchez, who was in town to cover a game, remains hospitalized, and the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office will make final charging decisions.</p>

          <p>University students often fall victim to "freshers' flu" in the early weeks of term, an assortment of common cold viruses exacerbated by their new environment. Immunologists explain that bringing together thousands of students from diverse backgrounds creates a "mixing pot" of infections, which spread rapidly in crowded lectures and shared living spaces. Factors like late nights, poor diet, and stress further weaken immune systems, making students more susceptible. This article highlights that while young people have strong immune responses, their lack of exposure to many viruses means initial encounters often lead to illness, underscoring the importance of rest and self-care.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted a Trump administration initiative that would have kept immigrant children in custody after their 18th birthdays, preventing their transfer to adult detention centers. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that automatically detaining these individuals violates a 2021 court order requiring their release to the "least restrictive setting" if not deemed a danger or flight risk. This article notes the ruling adds to ongoing federal clashes over Trump’s controversial immigration policies involving minors, including plans to offer children $2,500 to self-deport and accusations of reviving family separation tactics. Advocates praised the decision as a crucial protection for vulnerable youth.</p>

          <p>The United States, historically the main architect and largest financial contributor to the United Nations, is increasingly disengaging from the multilateral system it helped establish. This retreat, noted by former German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, comes at a "crossroads" for the UN, which remains adrift and struggling for direction.

Many attendees, some wearing Trump masks, credited the US president for brokering a deal that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had failed to achieve. The proposed plan involves Hamas releasing all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. While protesters expressed cautious optimism, some feared Netanyahu might still sabotage the agreement, despite his statement hoping for hostage returns "in the coming days."

          <p>An explosion and hours-long fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery deeply unnerved South Bay communities, injuring at least one worker and causing towering smoke plumes. Environmental advocates lament that the ongoing federal shutdown, which furloughed most OSHA staff and proposed eliminating the US Chemical Safety Board's funding, may prevent a thorough investigation into the fire's root cause. The refinery has a history of safety and environmental violations, accumulating 46 notices in five years, raising significant concerns.

          <p>An FBI agent has reportedly been suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in a planned "perp walk" of former FBI Director James Comey, deeming the public display inappropriate. Comey was indicted on federal charges days after President Trump publicly called for aggressive investigations into his political adversaries, including Comey. FBI leadership reportedly discussed sending "large, beefy" agents in Kevlar vests to escort Comey to his arraignment, a practice common in high-profile cases. This article highlights the controversy surrounding the handling of Comey's case and concerns about politicization within federal law enforcement, especially given Trump's past criticisms and the timing of the charges.</p>

          <p>National parks across the US are facing closures, reduced staffing, or reliance on outside donations as the federal government shutdown extends into its fourth day. The lack of a unified plan and sparse details from the National Park Service (NPS) have caused significant confusion for visitors, with many arriving to find parks unexpectedly closed. While some park roads and trails generally remain accessible, basic services like restrooms, trash collection, and road maintenance are severely limited or non-existent in many areas. Concerns are mounting over potential vandalism, sanitation issues, and ecological harm, leading some advocates to call for complete park closures until federal funding is restored.</p>
