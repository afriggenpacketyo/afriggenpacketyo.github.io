          <p>Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar delivered a pointed address at the UN General Assembly, calling out developed nations for their protectionist trade policies, including tariff volatility, technology controls, and supply-chain coercion. He specifically urged the Global South to unite against such measures, advocating for the "de-risking" of critical mineral supply chains, an apparent jab at China. Jaishankar emphasized that true global understanding requires resisting political interference and economic pressures, ensuring narratives are free of prejudice, and genuinely appreciating pluralism. This article highlights India's growing assertiveness on the international stage, championing a more equitable and stable global economic order for all nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated millions for decades. Trump announced the move on Truth Social, acknowledging the various theories surrounding the pilot's fate, including speculative spy missions and the widely accepted theory of a crash due to fuel exhaustion. While experts like journalist Laurie Gwen Shapiro dismiss conspiracy theories as "nonsense," a lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart on Saipan. This article highlights the enduring public fascination with historical mysteries and presidential actions.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling at a George Floyd racial justice protest in 2020, with termination letters citing a "lack of judgment." The FBI Agents Association condemned the dismissals, alleging rights violations and linking the actions to the Trump administration's broader efforts to remove "left-wing" policies and officials. Critics argue the kneeling was a tactic to de-escalate tensions, while some right-wing commentators had previously criticized such gestures.

          <p>An analysis explores how President Trump's unprecedented approach to scandal, characterized by openly flaunting misconduct, may be desensitizing the American public. Observers suggest this brazenness earns him perverse credit for "authenticity," diminishing the impact of actions that would have ended previous political careers. Examples include his public directives to the Justice Department against political opponents and accepting a luxury plane from Qatar. This article argues that Trump's ability to "flood the zone" with numerous controversies, coupled with a neutered Congress and co-opted institutions, has normalized behavior once deemed impeachable, creating a "new theory of scandal."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested the Supreme Court to uphold its executive order, signed on President Trump's first day back in office, which aims to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas.
