          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities have recovered what is believed to be the murder weapon, a high-powered rifle, and are analyzing evidence including fingerprints and ammunition with "transgender and anti-fascist" writing. The investigation indicates the shooting was a targeted attack, with the suspect firing a single shot from a rooftop before fleeing the campus.</p>

          <p>A new robot named HARR-E, developed by Oshkosh Corp., aims to revolutionize residential waste management by providing an on-demand trash pickup service. Users can summon the autonomous robot via an app, and it will travel from a central hub to their home to collect garbage before returning to unload and recharge. The system is designed for planned communities and business parks, promising benefits such as reduced noise pollution, cleaner streets, and lower emissions compared to traditional garbage trucks. The concept recently won a CES Picks Award, signaling significant industry interest.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was fatally shot, was a highly influential and polarizing figure in American politics. As the founder of Turning Point USA, he built one of the most powerful youth conservative organizations, credited with mobilizing young voters for Donald Trump. A close and trusted ally of the former president, Kirk was known for his campus debates and provocative commentary on social and political issues, which often drew fierce criticism from liberals. His daily podcast and large social media following made him a key voice in the MAGA movement.</p>

Farage has denied avoiding stamp duty by putting the property in her name, claiming she used her own funds from a wealthy family. However, the investigation found little evidence of such family wealth, as her father's business was liquidated and her parents live in a modest flat. The issue has opened Farage to accusations of hypocrisy, as he recently criticized another politician for avoiding stamp duty on a property transaction.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has entered an agreement with Ukraine to scale up the production of a Ukrainian-developed interceptor drone that has proven highly effective against Russian Shahed drones. Under the deal, Ukraine will share the intellectual property, and the U.K. will further develop and manufacture thousands of the drones per month for delivery back to Ukraine. The drones are said to cost a fraction of the Russian systems they are designed to destroy. The partnership aims to leverage Ukrainian innovation and British manufacturing capabilities to provide a cost-effective counter to a key threat on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>Following the downing of Russian drones in Polish airspace, a wave of misinformation has spread online, including fake videos and false claims from pro-Kremlin sources. A DW Fact Check analysis debunks several viral posts, revealing that some widely circulated videos allegedly showing the drone attacks are actually footage from the video game "Arma 3." Other misleading content includes out-of-context videos and false narratives attempting to deny the incursion or blame Ukraine. The article highlights the challenge of combating disinformation during sensitive geopolitical incidents and confirms the locations of the actual crash sites.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complex parallel economy that operates within prisons worldwide, involving governments, private corporations, organized crime, and inmates themselves. While governments spend billions on incarceration, private companies profit from services like food and phone calls, and crime syndicates run lucrative contraband and extortion rackets. For inmates, an informal marketplace exists where everyday items like ramen noodles become currency, and low-wage prison labor is common. The piece details how these economic systems, both formal and informal, shape life behind bars and often perpetuate cycles of debt and violence.</p>

          <p>An opinion column details a six-step morning protocol designed to manage negative emotions, particularly for those who feel worst in the early hours of the day. The routine, based on neuroscience and behavioral science, includes rising before dawn, vigorous physical exercise, and a period of metaphysical practice like meditation or prayer. It also involves strategically timing caffeine intake, consuming a protein-rich first meal to boost serotonin, and dedicating the first hours of work to an activity that induces a state of "flow." The author suggests this structured approach can significantly improve daily well-being.</p>

          <p>In response to an "unprecedented" incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace, several NATO members are deploying additional military assets to the alliance's eastern flank. The Netherlands and the Czech Republic are sending air defense systems, artillery, and troops to Poland, while Germany is expanding its air policing operations in the region. The incident, which saw three Russian drones shot down over Poland, has been labeled a "provocation" by European leaders and has significantly heightened tensions. The response demonstrates NATO's commitment to collective defense amid growing security concerns in Eastern Europe.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, has been dismissed from his post by Prime Minister Keir Starmer following the release of new documents detailing his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The documents revealed that the depth of Mandelson's friendship with Epstein was greater than previously known, including a suggestion that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful. A government statement indicated this new information made his position untenable, leading to his immediate withdrawal. The dismissal creates a diplomatic vacancy at a crucial time in U.S.-U.K. relations.</p>

          <p>A French parliamentary commission has recommended banning children under 15 from social media and implementing a "digital curfew" for those aged 15 to 18. The inquiry, which focused on the psychological effects of TikTok, described the platform as a "production line of distress" that exposes young people to harmful and addictive content. The recommendations also include banning mobile phones in schools and creating a crime of "digital negligence" for parents. The move reflects a growing trend in Europe to regulate children's access to social media, with similar measures being considered in other countries.</p>

          <p>The English Football Association has charged Chelsea FC with 74 alleged rule breaches related to payments made to agents between 2009 and 2022, primarily during Roman Abramovich's ownership. The investigation focuses on historical transfers, including those of star players like Eden Hazard and Willian, and concerns agents, intermediaries, and third-party investments. The club's new ownership group self-reported the potential breaches after their takeover in 2022. While sanctions could include fines or a transfer embargo, the club's cooperation is expected to be a mitigating factor in any punishment.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened further attacks on Qatar if the nation does not expel Hamas's political leadership, following a controversial Israeli strike in Doha. The statement comes in direct contrast to U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he had assured Qatari leaders that such an attack "will not happen again." The initial strike, which Israel claims targeted Hamas masterminds, has been condemned by Qatar and has complicated ceasefire negotiations. The incident has created a tense diplomatic situation between Israel, Qatar, and the U.S., which relies on Qatar as a key intermediary and host of a major military base.</p>
