          <p>The U.S. State Department has released its annual human rights report on China, which, despite being shorter due to a broader restructuring, maintains its sharp criticism of Beijing's conduct. The report, a comprehensive catalog of alleged violations, informs congressional decisions on foreign aid and is used in international legal proceedings. Its release was delayed this year amid controversy over potential softening of critiques against certain countries, and it was published without the usual formal event led by the Secretary of State.</p>

While revenue more than tripled year-over-year, the company recorded a net loss of over $290 million and saw its operating margin shrink due to stock-based compensation costs. CoreWeave, which rents Nvidia chips to major clients like OpenAI, noted that its growth remains constrained by supply as demand continues to outpace availability. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, Russian troops have reportedly made a significant 10km advance near Dobropillia, which Zelensky acknowledged while asserting the units responsible would be destroyed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly rebuked Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, suggesting he should fire the bank's chief economist or "focus on being a DJ" over a recent analysis of U.S. tariff policies. The criticism followed a research note from Goldman's Jan Hatzius, which concluded that American consumers would increasingly bear the cost of the tariffs. Trump contested this, claiming that foreign governments and companies pay for the duties and that they are generating massive revenue for the U.S. Treasury without causing inflation.</p>

          <p>China's construction of a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River is creating anxiety in downstream nations like India and Bangladesh, but this article argues it could be a chance to foster water diplomacy. The project, aimed at generating over 300 billion kilowatt-hours of clean energy annually, is seen as a key part of China's carbon-neutral goals and regional development. However, its strategic location and potential impact on water flow have significant geopolitical implications, highlighting the complex intersection of environmental projects and international relations in South Asia.</p>

          <p>In a town-hall with Census Bureau employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that Congress, not the president, has the ultimate authority over the national census. This statement comes after President Trump called for a "new" census to be conducted before the scheduled 2030 count.

          <p>The Crystal Palace, the iconic restaurant and music venue in Bakersfield, California, founded by country music legend Buck Owens, has permanently closed its doors. The venue, which was a cornerstone of the "Bakersfield Sound" and hosted countless country stars over 28 years, succumbed to economic pressures from the pandemic and a changing business landscape. The closure has prompted an outpouring of grief from fans, with many pleading for music stars like Dwight Yoakam or Garth Brooks, who both have deep ties to the venue, to step in and save it.</p>

          <p>Shares of the Mediterranean fast-casual chain Cava plummeted over 20% after the company lowered its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth from a range of 6-8% down to 4-6%. The revision came after the company reported a disappointing 2.1% increase in same-store sales for the second quarter, well below Wall Street's expectation of 6.1%. Cava's executives noted that traffic was roughly flat and that growth slowed after lapping the successful launch of its grilled steak option from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stock indices, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rallied on Tuesday, approaching record highs after the latest inflation data came in slightly better than anticipated.

This positive market reaction occurred despite underlying concerns about the future impact of tariffs and a recent jobs report that was weaker than expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has issued a defiant response to California Governor Gavin Newsom's threat to sue the Trump administration over the freezing of federal research grants to UCLA. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, "Bring it on, Gavin," asserting the administration is within its legal rights to demand over $1 billion and sweeping campus changes to resolve federal findings of antisemitism and other violations. Newsom has called the move "extortion" and a "political shakedown," setting the stage for a major legal and political battle between California and the federal government.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Michigan has awarded nearly $60 million to Sean MacMaster, a former police officer who was wrongfully charged with sexual abuse. The jury found that a former state prosecutor, Brian Kolodziej, and a state police lieutenant, David Busacca, acted with malice or reckless disregard for the truth in pursuing the case. The charges were later dismissed by the Attorney General, who cited "serious violations of prosecutorial standards," including revelations that the prosecutor had an improper relationship in a related case.</p>
