          <p>In Alberta, Canada, the possibility of separation from Canada is gaining traction amidst dissatisfaction with Liberal rule and concerns about the region's role within the country. Separatist sentiments have been fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's comments about Canada potentially becoming the 51st U.S. state, and by perceptions of western alienation. While the idea of an independent Alberta remains unlikely, the issue poses a challenge to Canada's next prime minister, particularly if the Liberals win the upcoming election. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has even pursued independent trade talks with the U.S., underscoring the province's desire for greater autonomy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the United States is nearing a tariff deal with Japan, as negotiations continue between the two countries. Japan's chief representative in tariff negotiations is scheduled to visit Washington for further discussions, seeking reconsideration of duties on exports, including automobiles. Trump views the tariff talks with Japan as a priority, potentially setting a precedent for other countries seeking relief from U.S. tariffs. The process is being considered a test case for other countries also seeking relief from wide-ranging U.S. tariffs.</p>
