          <h2>Xbox Prices Increase Globally Due to Tariff Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 13:09:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft has announced price increases for its Xbox consoles worldwide, citing rising development costs and "market conditions." The price of the Xbox Series S has increased by £50 in the UK, while the Series X has seen steeper rises in the US. This decision comes amid global economic uncertainty fueled by increasing US tariffs, although Microsoft has not explicitly linked the price hike to tariffs. Experts predict that these tariffs will increase prices for consumers, impacting the gaming industry, with accessories and components often manufactured in China. The price increases mark a departure from the typical trend of console prices decreasing after launch.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Phil Mickelson publicly criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on social media regarding Schumer's opposition to the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. Mickelson accused Schumer of not representing American citizens' best interests and labeled him a "traitor" for opposing the bill, which requires voters to provide proof of citizenship when registering for federal elections and removes noncitizens from voter rolls. Schumer has described the SAVE Act as "dangerous" and reminiscent of Jim Crow laws, vowing to block its passage in the Senate, where it requires 60 votes to advance. Mickelson doubled down on his stance despite facing criticism for his initial post.</p>

          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz is expected to leave his position in the Trump administration following controversy surrounding his use of a Signal messaging app group to discuss U.S. military plans. The group inadvertently included The Atlantic Editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who reported details of the messages exchanged between high-level officials.

          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, are expected to leave their positions in the Trump White House, reportedly as part of a reorganization. Waltz faced scrutiny after mistakenly including a journalist in a Signal chat discussing military strike plans. While President Trump publicly supported Waltz following the incident, sufficient time has passed to frame the departures as part of a broader restructuring. Speculation surrounds potential replacements, including Stephen Miller or Seb Gorka, though Steve Witkoff is not expected to be considered.</p>

The long-term consequences include a plummeting credit score, making it harder to qualify for loans, and potential wage garnishment.

          <p>Former TV meteorologist Bree Smith is advocating for regulations against deepfakes after her image was doctored in explicit pictures and videos used for sextortion scams. She left her job after months of fighting the deepfakes, which were used to extort money from others. Smith is backing a bill in the Tennessee Senate that would allow people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent. She aims to define the act as illegal and hold offenders accountable.</p>
