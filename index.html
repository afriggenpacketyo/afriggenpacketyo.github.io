          <p>Opinion columnist David Brooks expresses his anger towards statements made by Patrick Deneen and JD Vance, who suggest soldiers are not motivated by ideals but by their unit or home. Brooks argues that these statements represent the moral decay at the core of Trumpism, which he views as an attempt to diminish the highest aspirations of the human spirit. He believes Trumpism reduces people to their most primitive instincts, disgracing the country and its values. Brooks suggests that these statements are indicative of a broader issue within the movement.</p>

          <p>Andrew and Tristan Tate will return to the UK to face 21 criminal charges, including sexual assault and human trafficking, once their ongoing legal proceedings in Romania conclude. The Crown Prosecution Service authorized the charges in 2024, preceding an extradition warrant. The Tates deny all charges, claiming they are innocent men. A Romanian court has ruled they can be extradited to the UK after any trial in Romania, with no clear timeline for the proceedings there.</p>

          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, often synonymous with debt settlement, offers borrowers a potential reduction of 30% to 50% in their balance. It can be achieved through negotiated debt settlement, specific bankruptcy types, or debt management programs. Qualification typically requires a debt balance of $5,000 to $10,000, being behind on payments, and demonstrating financial hardship. Borrowers should explore various debt relief options to determine the most suitable approach for their circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>
