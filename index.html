In contrast, South Korea's Kospi declined, and Singapore reported a larger-than-expected contraction in non-oil domestic exports, highlighting varied economic performance across the region.

A volunteer dive team discovered the vehicle pinned under a bridge, concluding an extensive search that began after they disappeared following a doctor's appointment. While authorities previously stated they did not suspect foul play in the disappearance, the California Highway Patrol is now investigating the circumstances that led to the vehicle entering the water.</p>

          <p>According to a special U.S. envoy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense principle. This potential breakthrough, described as "game-changing," emerged from recent talks and represents a significant shift in Russia's long-standing opposition to such security arrangements for Ukraine. The specifics of how this guarantee would function are still unclear, but it is viewed as a key step toward a potential peace deal.</p>

While the fines would have amounted to thousands of dollars with inflation, the library, which has been fine-free since 2021, has put the well-preserved book on display.</p>

          <p>An Australian federal court has ordered Qantas Airways to pay a A$90 million ($58.64 million) fine for illegally terminating 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The workers were replaced with contractors in a move that the court aimed to penalize severely to deter similar corporate actions in the future. The judge emphasized that the penalty should not be seen as a mere cost of doing business. A significant portion of the fine will be paid to the Transport Workers' Union, which represented the affected staff.</p>

          <p>Actress Dame Helen Mirren has asserted that the iconic role of James Bond should continue to be played by a man, stating that a female portrayal "just doesn't work." Despite identifying as a feminist, she believes the character is fundamentally male and changing this would alter the essence of the franchise. Her sentiment was echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who is co-starring with Mirren in an upcoming film. The producers are planning a fresh take on the character but intend to honor his legacy.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis as its population continues a steep decline, with the country on pace to shrink by half by the end of the century. The nation's fertility rate has hit an all-time low, and last year deaths outnumbered births by more than two to one. This trend poses significant challenges to Japan's economy, healthcare system, and national defense. The government has implemented measures like a city-run dating app and shortened workweeks to encourage family formation, but these efforts have so far failed to reverse the decline.</p>

          <p>Nearly a quarter-century after the September 11th attacks, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its mission to identify victims, recently naming three more individuals through advanced DNA technology. This ongoing effort has provided long-awaited answers to some families, while about 40% of the victims remain unidentified. Scientists use sophisticated techniques to extract genetic material from remains that were severely damaged, demonstrating a sustained commitment to fulfilling a promise made to the families of the nearly 2,800 people lost.</p>

          <p>World number three Iga Swiatek will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the final of the Cincinnati Open after a convincing straight-set victory over Elena Rybakina.

Paolini advanced to the final after a hard-fought three-set win against Veronika Kudermetova, setting the stage for a competitive championship match.</p>

          <p>Jon Rahm has won the LIV Golf individual season championship for the second year in a row, earning the top prize of $18 million. He secured the title despite losing a playoff to Sebastian Munoz at the event in Indiana. Rahm's consistent performance throughout the season was enough to edge out his closest competitor, Joaquin Niemann. The result also had positive implications for his former Ryder Cup teammates Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both avoided relegation from the league for the next season.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members involved in the Trump administration's increased policing initiative in Washington may carry weapons, a shift from an earlier Army statement. While Guard members will primarily serve as a "visible crime deterrent" and will not make arrests, they may be armed based on their mission and training. This development comes amid controversy over the federal government's expanded law enforcement presence in the city, which critics call an overreach and supporters praise for enhancing safety.</p>

Her story went viral on TikTok, and she is now focused on his continued recovery and integration into his new home.</p>
