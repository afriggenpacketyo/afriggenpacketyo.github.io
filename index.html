          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, largely fueled by sustained high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology. These specialized memory chips are critical components in the AI chipsets used by major tech companies like Nvidia. The company expressed confidence for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventories and anticipating that ongoing AI investments by corporations and governments will continue to drive demand. SK Hynix expects to double its HBM sales for the full year compared to 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified additional documents related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, claiming they show Obama administration officials fabricated intelligence to undermine Donald Trump. This move has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and intelligence officials, who warn that releasing such sensitive material, including raw intelligence from human sources, irresponsibly risks compromising critical sources and methods. Gabbard asserted the action was to prevent the politicization of intelligence, while critics accuse her of engaging in a partisan effort that could endanger national security.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. representatives has introduced a resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest over the next 30 years. Proponents of the resolution argue the plan is an inhumane and costly waste of taxpayer money. However, some scientists and conservationists contend that culling the more aggressive barred owls is the only way to prevent the extinction of the native northern spotted owl, which is being pushed out of its habitat. The debate highlights a significant conflict between ethical considerations and conservation strategies for endangered species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new studies published in the British Medical Journal have raised significant concerns about the accuracy and reliability of many commercially available at-home health test kits. Researchers found that a majority of the tested kits, which screen for conditions like bowel cancer and vitamin deficiencies, lack sufficient data on their accuracy and fail to provide clear guidance on interpreting results. Experts warn that misleading results could lead to either false reassurance or unnecessary anxiety, placing additional strain on public health services like the NHS. The findings have prompted calls for much stricter regulation of the growing self-test market.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has filed a ballot initiative to repeal the city's gross receipts tax, a move they argue would improve the city's "anti-job climate" and provide economic relief. If passed, the measure would eliminate a tax that generates over $800 million annually for the city's general fund, which finances essential services like police and fire departments. City officials have sounded the alarm, warning that such a significant revenue loss would be an "assault on public safety" and could force drastic cuts. The proposal escalates an ongoing battle between business and labor groups over the city's economic policies.</p>

          <p>The White House has refuted media reports claiming President Donald Trump's name appears in Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling the stories as "fake news." The pushback follows reports that the Attorney General had previously briefed the president on the contents. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Florida denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury materials from the state's 2006 investigation into Epstein, citing secrecy rules. The developments come as the administration faces growing pressure to release more information about the deceased sex offender and his network.</p>

          <p>A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found that the order, which seeks to deny automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judges rejected the administration's novel interpretation of the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the policy, affirming that the president cannot unilaterally change the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship.</p>

The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, economists remain cautious, suggesting the growth pace may not be sustainable due to the looming threat of trade conflicts and a potential slowdown in global demand.

          <p>Veteran golfer Lee Westwood has criticized the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR), calling it a "mockery" for its failure to award points to LIV Golf tour events. His comments came after his performance at The Open Championship caused him to jump nearly 3,800 spots in the rankings, highlighting the system's volatility for LIV players who only earn points at major championships. Westwood and other LIV golfers argue that excluding their league's events undermines the ranking's credibility by not accurately reflecting the world's best players. The controversy underscores the ongoing friction between the established golf tours and the newer, Saudi-backed LIV Golf league.</p>

While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the deals are seen as part of a broader U.S. effort to contain China's dominance.

          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing early signs of a shift, though it remains firmly in favor of sellers. According to real estate data, the number of homes for sale has increased, with 34% more sellers than buyers in May, the highest rate since 2013. Despite this rise in inventory, median home prices also hit a record high in June, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low-interest mortgages to sell. Experts suggest that while conditions are still challenging for buyers, the increased inventory may lead to more negotiating power, particularly for homes that have been on the market longer.</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored a crucial extra-time winner against Germany, sending her team to its first-ever Women's Euro final. The goal capped a remarkable personal journey for the two-time Ballon d'Or winner, who was hospitalized with viral meningitis just days before the tournament began. After a slow start to the competition, Bonmati demonstrated her world-class skill with a skillful turn and powerful shot in a tightly contested semi-final. Her performance was hailed as the decisive factor in a game that had been dominated by Spain but stymied by a resilient German defense.</p>

          <p>California officials are warning that the state's $21 billion wildfire insurance fund could be completely depleted by claims from the devastating Eaton wildfire in Los Angeles. If investigators determine that utility company Southern California Edison's equipment caused the blaze, the fund would be liable for insured losses estimated to be as high as $15.2 billion, plus legal settlements. The fund was established in 2019 to stabilize utility companies facing massive wildfire liabilities. Its potential exhaustion raises serious questions about the financial durability of the state's strategy for managing the catastrophic costs of wildfires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the TRACERS mission, sending two identical satellites into orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem to study how the solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the sun, interacts with Earth's magnetic field. This interaction creates "space weather," which can produce spectacular auroras but also disrupt satellites, GPS signals, and power grids on the ground. By taking precise, simultaneous measurements from two points, scientists hope to better understand and eventually predict these potentially dangerous space weather events, helping to protect critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The UK's vehicle manufacturing industry experienced its worst first half of a year since 1953, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car output fell by 7.3%, while van production plummeted by 45%, partly due to a plant closure. The downturn has been exacerbated by uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production. While the government hopes reintroduced EV grants will boost the industry, the SMMT expressed doubt about meeting long-term production targets without significant new investment.

The comeback was made possible by a brilliant seven-inning, 12-strikeout performance from starter Tyler Glasnow and a record-tying fifth consecutive game with a home run from Shohei Ohtani.
