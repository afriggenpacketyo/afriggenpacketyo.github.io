        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, including BYD and Nio, reported a significant rebound in deliveries for August. This recovery follows a summer slump caused by an intense price war within the industry. The surge is largely attributed to the launch of new, more affordable models that have attracted budget-conscious consumers. These positive sales figures suggest renewed momentum for China's competitive EV market.</p>

          <p>A local council in Epping, UK, has announced its intention to appeal to the Supreme Court regarding a hotel being used to house asylum seekers. This move follows a Court of Appeal decision that overturned a temporary injunction which would have forced the asylum seekers to leave. The case highlights ongoing national tensions over asylum policy, local governance, and public protests, with the council arguing the hotel's use violates planning rules.</p>

          <p>Scotland recorded a 13% drop in drug misuse deaths in 2024, the lowest number since 2017, yet it still has the highest fatality rate in Europe. The article delves into the deep-rooted causes of the crisis, linking it to deindustrialization, social alienation, and poverty over several decades. Experts express concern that the recent emergence of potent synthetic opioids like nitazenes could reverse this progress, warning of a potential new surge in deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inflation in the euro zone edged up to 2.1% in August, slightly surpassing economists' expectations of it remaining at 2.0%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, held steady at 2.3%, while services inflation saw a minor decrease. This slight uptick is considered unlikely to alter the European Central Bank's current monetary policy, with analysts predicting that interest rates will remain unchanged in the near future.

          <p>The British pub industry is facing a severe crisis, with projections indicating one pub could close every day in 2025 due to mounting financial pressures. A combination of rising minimum wage, increased business rates, and lower consumer spending is squeezing publicans' profit margins. Industry bodies warn that these closures will have a significant negative impact on the UK economy, affecting jobs and the entire supply chain, from farmers to manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The value of Chinese stocks purchased with borrowed money, or margin buying, reached a record US$319.2 billion on Monday. This surge in leveraged trading has fueled a market rally but is also raising concerns about potential overheating and market instability. The activity, driven largely by retail traders and quantitative hedge funds, echoes the conditions seen just before a market crash in 2015, prompting some analysts to warn of investment risks.

According to a rebel group that controls the area, only a single person survived the disaster, which followed days of heavy rainfall.

His government is increasingly framing its policies in contrast to the populist approach of Reform UK, which has gained prominence by focusing on issues like asylum. The political landscape is defined by a contest between Labour's call for patience with its iterative policies and Reform's push for more radical solutions.</p>

The statement coincides with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance at the SCO summit, highlighting the complex geopolitical dynamics at play.</p>
