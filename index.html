          <p>Apple is set to pay $95 million to settle allegations that Siri-enabled devices eavesdropped on users' private conversations and shared them with third-party businesses for targeted advertising. The settlement stems from a 2021 lawsuit filed by consumers who alleged Siri listened to private or confidential conversations. Individuals who owned Siri-enabled iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, iMacs, HomePods, iPod Touches, and Apple TVs between September 17, 2014, and December 31, 2024, and experienced unintended Siri activations during private communications are eligible to file a claim by July 2, 2025, with a maximum payout of $100 per person. Consumers can file a claim on the settlement website, and payments are expected to be processed after the final approval hearing on August 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that the liberal media has only recently acknowledged truths that everyday Americans have known for years, such as President Biden's mental decline, the origins of COVID-19, the border crisis, and the dangers of children undergoing sex changes. The author criticizes the media for gaslighting the public and pushing narratives that contradict common sense. The article questions whether the media genuinely believed these falsehoods or knowingly promoted them, ultimately accusing them of sacrificing credibility for political agendas. The author concludes that the liberal media cannot regain the trust of the American people with belated apologies and admissions.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is rebranding its streaming platform from Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The change reflects a strategic shift towards prioritizing quality programming over sheer volume of content. CEO David Zaslav emphasized the power of the HBO brand, aiming to accelerate growth by focusing on distinct and high-quality shows for adults and families. This move comes as the company aims to reach over 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026, mirroring a similar strategy by Disney to emphasize quality content in the streaming market.</p>

          <p>A new Republican tax bill proposes raising the child tax credit to $2,500 per child but could exclude an estimated 17 million children from receiving the full credit due to their parents' low income. Another provision would require parents to have a social security number to claim the credit, impacting undocumented immigrants with citizen children. Critics argue this contradicts Republicans' stated goal of incentivizing larger families, as many low-income families would receive only a fraction of the credit. The bill also includes tax breaks for businesses and hikes taxes on university endowments.</p>

          <p>Former Olympic cyclist Rohan Dennis received a suspended sentence for causing the death of his wife, Melissa Hoskins, in what was termed a "tragic accident." Dennis pleaded guilty to committing an aggravated act likely to cause harm after Hoskins was struck by his vehicle in front of their home. The court heard that the couple had argued before the incident, and Hoskins had jumped onto the hood of the car. Dennis was sentenced to one year, four months and 28 days in jail, suspended for two years, and his license was suspended for five years.</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock argues that Republican-backed Medicaid work requirements would reduce healthcare coverage for hardworking individuals, citing examples from Arkansas and Georgia where similar policies created bureaucratic hurdles.

Warnock advocates for providing basic healthcare without such requirements to encourage employment and strengthen the economy. A Republican House budget resolution includes significant Medicaid spending cuts through 2034, with work requirements being considered as part of eligibility policies.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent drop in national credit card balances, many Americans still struggle with high-interest debt. Strategies to reduce credit card debt include negotiating debt settlement with creditors, consolidating multiple debts into a personal loan or home equity loan, and transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card. Credit counseling can also help with debt management plans. It is important to choose a strategy that aligns with individual circumstances and can be consistently followed to achieve debt reduction.</p>

His resistance to the court's rightward shift became more apparent over time, influencing the vetting of future Republican nominees.

The primary kit, white with a star print, draws comparisons to the 1994 men's World Cup kit and is seen as a tribute to past generations of American soccer, though some find the design more reminiscent of patriotic napkins. The away kit, featuring pinstripes, is considered more streetwear-friendly but receives mixed reviews regarding its connection to the "pulse of the soccer nation." Overall, the collection is ranked in the top half of US kits, with its success ultimately depending on the memories made while wearing them.</p>

          <p>A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that private individuals and groups cannot use a federal statute known as Section 1983 to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in seven Midwestern states. This decision limits the ability of private parties to sue for racial discrimination in the election process, reversing decades of precedent. The ruling stems from a North Dakota redistricting lawsuit by tribal nations and is seen as a potential prelude to further challenges to the Voting Rights Act at the Supreme Court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed weakening environmental conditions tied to subsidies for farmers following months of protests across the EU. The changes could save farmers up to €1.58 billion per year and limit on-site checks on farms to once per year. Smaller farmers would be exempted from conditions tying subsidies to environmental regulations, and certified organic farms would be considered as automatically meeting certain regulations. The Commission aims to boost farmers' competitiveness and reduce the administrative burden on the agricultural sector.</p>

          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths dropped sharply in 2024, with 30,000 fewer deaths compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded. An estimated 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, and shifts in drug use patterns. Despite the progress, overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, underscoring the need for continued efforts to address the crisis.</p>

The U.S. administration finds these demands unjustified given the high cost and limited territorial gains by Russian forces.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS. The EPA will keep standards for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion but give utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply.
