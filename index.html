          <p>Former President Joe Biden admitted he bears some responsibility for President Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in 2024, citing his position as the incumbent. However, Biden defended his record, blaming Trump for obstructing a bipartisan border security bill. He believes he could have defeated Trump if he had remained in the race, but wasn't surprised by Harris's loss, attributing it to sexism and the COVID-19 pandemic's negative impact. Biden criticized Trump's first 100 days and foreign policy views, dismissing Trump's claims about invalid pardons as "vacant.</p>

A forensic pathologist's report suggests only two bullets struck Mahdi, missing the heart and resulting in consciousness for up to a minute after being shot. Witnesses reported hearing Mahdi cry out and groan after the shots. The lawsuit challenges the firing squad's constitutionality, citing "cruel and unusual punishment."

          <p>The Trump administration is considering cutting a $56 million grant for training first responders in naloxone use, a drug that reverses opioid overdoses. This proposal comes as overdose deaths have recently decreased, partly due to wider naloxone access. Experts warn that cutting this funding could reverse progress in combating opioid overdoses. The grant money is used by state and local organizations for training and distributing naloxone, as well as referring patients to treatment services.</p>
