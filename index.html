          <h2>Commentary Argues True Free Speech Requires a Foundation of Free Thought</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that the contemporary debate over free speech often overlooks the essential prerequisite of free thought. Drawing on John Stuart Mill, the author argues that speech is not truly "free" if it stems from prejudice, manipulation, or fear rather than a conscientious pursuit of truth through learning and open discussion. The piece identifies threats to free thought, such as cognitive biases, propaganda, and the consolidation of media ownership. It advocates for fostering cultural norms that support education, inquiry, and empathetic engagement to protect genuine free speech.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of real estate agents reveals that a majority of potential homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines, anticipating that mortgage rates will fall further. Despite a recent dip in rates, affordability remains the top concern for buyers, who are delaying purchases due to economic uncertainty and the hope for better financing conditions. This buyer hesitation has created a standoff with sellers, many of whom are still pricing their homes for a more competitive market, leading to price reductions and some homes being delisted.

          <p>A university professor and linguist presents a counter-narrative to the widespread concern about students using AI for their academic work. The author suggests that educators should adapt to the new technological reality rather than lamenting a decline in traditional reading and writing habits, comparing the situation to the adoption of calculators. The article proposes that assignments can be redesigned to require personal insight and in-class work, forcing students to engage with material in ways AI cannot replicate.

          <p>A former British paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, has been acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges related to the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Northern Ireland. The veteran was charged with the deaths of James Wray and William McKinney during a civil rights march where soldiers shot 13 people. The prosecution's case ultimately collapsed because key evidence, primarily statements from two other former soldiers made in 1972, was deemed inadmissible in court. The verdict concludes a lengthy and painful legal process for the victims' families without a conviction.</p>

          <p>A plan by the city of Tallahassee, Florida, to sell a city-owned country club to its private operators has generated significant public outrage. The controversy stems from the fact that the golf course was built over a long-lost burial ground for enslaved people from a former plantation on the site. Community activists and descendants are decrying the proposal as a sale of their ancestors' heritage, especially since a promised memorial at the site has not been built years after archaeologists identified dozens of unmarked graves.
