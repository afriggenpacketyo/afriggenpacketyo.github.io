          <p>Cassie Ventura testified that her relationship with Sean Combs transitioned into an abusive one, marked by controlling behavior and physical violence. She described instances of Combs hitting her and closely monitoring her actions, which caused her to worry about his moods and reactions. Ventura also detailed the stifling of her music career due to Combs' behavior and alleged sexual encounters with prostitutes that lasted for extended periods. She said that these encounters became like a job, leaving her little time to recover and feel normal. Ventura's testimony is expected to continue for the remainder of the trial. </p>

          <p>Peter Coker Sr. received a six-month jail sentence for his role in a sophisticated, multi-year scheme to artificially inflate the stock prices of Hometown International, a deli-owning company, and E-Waste, a shell company. Judge Christine O'Hearn deemed the companies worthless and the scheme fraudulent from its inception, causing nearly $5 million in losses, including investments from Duke and Vanderbilt universities. Coker Sr., along with his son Peter Coker Jr. and James Patten, aimed to make the companies attractive for mergers with privately owned firms. The 82-year-old expressed remorse for his actions and was also ordered to serve six months of home confinement, pay a $500,000 fine, and provide up to $644,000 in restitution.

          <p>Governors across the United States, particularly Democrats, are voicing concerns about the potential budgetary impact of the Trump administration's economic agenda. The Trump administration is considering significant cuts to federal aid for major public services such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These cuts are framed as a matter of fiscal necessity and federalism, but state leaders worry they will be unable to absorb the new costs. The proposed budget includes substantial reductions to programs ranging from public education to mental health, while increasing military spending and aggressive deportations.</p>

          <p>Despite publicly dismissing warnings of food shortages, an internal Israeli analysis concludes that a crisis looms in Gaza if food supplies are not restored, with some Israeli military officials privately acknowledging the risk of widespread starvation. These officials warn that unless the blockade is lifted quickly, many areas of Gaza will run out of enough food to meet minimum daily nutritional needs. The acknowledgment of a hunger crisis contrasts with Israel's public stance, which has maintained that the blockade did not pose a major threat to civilian life. The analysis also highlights the urgency of the situation, as bakeries and charity kitchens close, and the UN's World Food Program runs out of supplies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government, led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa, to give the country a chance at peace. Al-Sharaa, a former insurgent, assumed power after a military offensive that ended the Assad family's 54-year rule. Trump's decision came at the urging of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who believe the new government can counter Iran's influence in Syria. This move marks a significant shift in U.S. policy and puts Trump at odds with Israel, which remains skeptical of Al-Sharaa's past.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny for its apparent disregard for ethical norms and legal guardrails, with examples including accepting a luxury jet from Qatar and the Trump family's involvement in a meme cryptocurrency. The administration's plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from the Qatari royal family, intended for use as Air Force One and later transferred to his presidential foundation, highlights this trend. The administration has also disbanded a Justice Department unit investigating cryptocurrency crimes and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

          <p>Inflation retreated in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, with the consumer price index rising 2.3% annually, the smallest increase since February 2021. However, economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump could reignite inflation, potentially costing the average U.S. household an extra $2,800. A 10% average tariff rate could add as much as 1 percentage point to the consumer price index after about six to nine months. There are some signs of tariff effects in the CPI report, such as a nearly 9% jump in audio equipment prices.</p>

          <p>Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm has sold $198 million worth of Tesla stock in the past six months, bringing her total profit from stock sales to over $530 million since becoming board leader in late 2018. These sales raise questions about her confidence in Tesla's future, particularly as CEO Elon Musk dedicates time to the Trump administration. Musk's political activities have also alienated some car buyers, contributing to a decline in Tesla's car sales and a decrease in quarterly profit. Some investors have criticized Denholm and other board members for a lack of oversight over Musk.</p>

          <p>Independent test results confirm that drinking water in fire-affected areas around Altadena and the Pacific Palisades is largely free of harmful contaminants, leading an Altadena utility to lift the last "do not drink" notice. The LA Fire HEALTH Study found only one home with a toxic substance, benzene, slightly above the state's allowable level, which would likely drop after flushing the lines. Experts attribute the quick restoration of safe drinking water to the hard work of local utilities and state regulators, who followed a post-fire playbook developed after previous fires. Residents are advised to flush their lines to ensure water safety.</p>
