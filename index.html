          <p>A 90-day freeze on extensive U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. Experts warn that if the Trump administration does not secure new trade deals, the re-imposition of steep, country-specific import duties could spark inflation and harm financial markets. While some new agreements have been announced, the fate of trade relations with dozens of other nations remains unknown. Analysts suggest a likely outcome is a mix of finalized deals, further extensions for some countries, and the levying of higher tariffs on others perceived as uncooperative.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to rule on the legality of state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that prohibit transgender girls and women from competing in female school sports. The cases will determine whether these bans violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, a federal law against sex-based discrimination in education. This decision follows a surge of similar legislation in nearly two dozen states and recent actions by the Trump administration and the NCAA to restrict transgender athletic participation.

          <p>The Senate confirmation hearing for judicial nominee Emil Bove, a former personal attorney for Donald Trump, was described by critics as a travesty of the confirmation process. The Republican committee chair invoked executive privilege to shield Bove from questioning about his controversial past, including allegations of abusive behavior and politicizing the Justice Department. Adding to the controversy, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General attended the hearing in a move Democrats called an act of intimidation to ensure Republican senators voted in favor. The hearing was further complicated by a whistleblower's claim that Bove suggested the DOJ should defy court orders.</p>

          <p>J. Michael Luttig, a respected conservative former federal judge, has publicly expressed his disappointment with Chief Justice John Roberts for failing to directly condemn Donald Trump's attacks on the judiciary. Luttig argues that Roberts' generalized statements about judicial independence are insufficient and that his silence on the president's specific threats is an "unforgivable reticence." The critique highlights the tension between Roberts' role as an institutional defender of the courts and the growing political pressure and threats of violence targeting judges, which Luttig believes Roberts has a profound obligation to address more forcefully.</p>

          <p>After a tense overnight session of negotiations, the U.S. House of Representatives advanced President Trump's massive spending and tax cut package, known as the "big, beautiful bill." Republican leaders, with direct involvement from Trump who worked the phones, successfully convinced a group of party holdouts to support the legislation in a crucial procedural vote. The bill, which extends tax cuts from his first term while cutting social programs, narrowly passed the Senate earlier in the week. The successful maneuvering marks a significant win for the administration as it pushes for the bill's final passage.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister has proposed establishing direct agreements with the Taliban to enable the deportation of convicted Afghan criminals back to Afghanistan. This move signals a potential shift in policy, as Germany does not officially recognize the Taliban government and has previously relied on third-party mediators for such talks. The push for a direct deal comes amid rising anti-immigrant sentiment and pressure from the political right to take a harder line on migration and deportations. The German government is also reportedly pursuing a similar agreement with Syria for the repatriation of Syrian criminals.</p>

          <p>A Maryland man was arrested and charged with a felony after allegedly trying to bring a "ghost gun" into the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill. The untraceable firearm, which lacked a serial number, was discovered when the man's bag went through a security scanner. Ghost guns are typically assembled from kits, making them difficult for law enforcement to track. The suspect claimed he forgot the weapon was in his bag. This incident is the latest in a series of more than 20 unlawful firearm arrests on Capitol Hill this year, a notable increase from 2023.</p>

However, many in the industry still view any tariff increase as detrimental, warning that it will inevitably lead to higher prices for consumers on goods like footwear and apparel as companies look to protect their profit margins.

          <p>To overcome internal party opposition to his major spending bill, President Trump personally assured Republican holdouts that he would work to improve the legislation in the future. After a night of negotiations, wavering conservatives said they received promises from the president regarding changes to provisions they opposed, such as tax credits for wind and solar energy. While no alterations were made to the bill's text before the vote, these assurances, and the argument that key conservative wins were already secured, were enough to flip their votes and allow the package to advance.</p>

The healthcare and social assistance sector followed closely, adding over 58,000 positions. This strong growth in public and health-related fields offset job losses in other areas, such as professional services, manufacturing, and wholesale trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, the influential and controversial televangelist who built a global media empire before it crumbled under the weight of sex scandals, has died at 90. Known for his fiery Pentecostal preaching style, Swaggart's ministry reached 140 countries and generated massive revenues. His career imploded in 1988 after he was caught with a prostitute, a downfall made more dramatic by his prior denunciations of fellow preachers for moral failures. A second, similar scandal three years later sealed the collapse of his national ministry, though he continued preaching on a smaller scale.</p>

          <p>When deciding between a long-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account, the choice involves a trade-off between rate security and flexibility. While current high-yield savings rates are slightly higher, they are variable and likely to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed interest rate for its entire term, providing predictable returns but penalizing early withdrawals. Calculations show a high-yield savings account currently earns slightly more on paper, but a CD may prove more profitable if rates drop as expected. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation also preserves a popular loophole allowing business owners to bypass the SALT cap. While most of the 2017 tax cuts are extended, the bill also introduces new limits on the value of some itemized deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill also allocates billions for border wall construction and immigration enforcement, rolls back numerous green energy tax incentives, and raises the national debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

The author, a Millennial turning 30, contemplates the fine line between empathetic observation and judgmental scrutiny when writing about generational trends.

          <h2>HHS Secretary RFK Jr. and New CDC Panel Cast Doubt on Safety of Hepatitis B Vaccine for Newborns</h2>

This move has alarmed infectious disease experts, who stress there is no evidence the vaccine is unsafe and that universal infant vaccination has been key to virtually eliminating the virus in children. Kennedy has also made unsubstantiated claims linking the vaccine to autism. Critics worry this official skepticism toward a well-studied and successful vaccine could undermine public health.</p>
