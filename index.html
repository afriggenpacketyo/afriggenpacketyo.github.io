          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before House and Senate committees, addressing budget cuts and his stance on vaccines. Kennedy stated that people should not take medical advice from him, deferring to NIH and CDC doctors on vaccine matters. He defended the department's workforce cuts, which include layoffs and consolidations, aiming to streamline operations and focus on chronic disease. Democrats questioned the impact of these cuts on essential health programs and the response to the recent measles outbreak, criticizing the administration's priorities and the potential consequences for public health.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the caps would apply to both Medicare and the private market, though legal challenges are expected.</p>
