          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a stunning pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, outperforming championship contenders Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri. This marks Russell's first pole since June and the first for Mercedes in Singapore since 2018, providing a significant boost for the team. The result came as a surprise, shifting the weekend's focus from a potential third consecutive win for Verstappen to Russell's impressive performance. Despite brushing a wall during his first run in the final qualifying session, Russell managed to set the fastest lap and then improve upon it, securing the top spot for the race.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has raised serious concerns that the human smuggling prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García may be an illegal act of retaliation by the Department of Justice. This development follows Ábrego García's successful lawsuit against the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. Judge Waverly Crenshaw granted a hearing to review evidence of vindictive prosecution, citing alarming public statements by administration officials that seemed to link the charges directly to his legal victory. The case highlights the intense partisan struggle over immigration policy and the potential use of the justice system for political retribution.</p>

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside more than £60 million to compensate individuals who allege they were victims of historical abuse by its former owner, Mohamed Al Fayed. The redress scheme, which is open until March 2026, is expected to handle claims from over 100 former employees who have accused Fayed of sexual assault. This financial provision has significantly impacted the company's finances, contributing to a £34.3 million loss in its latest annual accounts. Harrods has stated that while it cannot change the past, it is committed to doing the right thing for the survivors.</p>

A fifth-round draft pick in 2010, he also played for the Indianapolis Colts and Washington before retiring. Jones was the older brother of former UFC champion Jon Jones and NFL Pro Bowler Chandler Jones, and was remembered by his alma mater, Syracuse, as a tremendous player and an even better person.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a railway station in Shostka, a city in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, has injured at least 30 people, including train staff and passengers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strike as an act of terrorism, stating that the targeting of civilians was intentional and something the world cannot ignore. The attack, which set a train carriage on fire, is part of a recent intensification of Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine.

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in at least 10 deaths, were sparked by demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. The deal brokered by a delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has led to the government accepting the protesters' key demands. Following the announcement, the alliance's leader urged demonstrators to disperse, bringing a peaceful resolution to the widespread civil unrest in the region's capital, Muzaffarabad.</p>

          <p>The Buffalo Bills NFL team has drawn backlash from its fanbase after publicly wishing "good luck" to the Toronto Blue Jays in their MLB postseason series against the New York Yankees. Many fans and sports commentators expressed their disapproval on social media, arguing that a New York-based team should support another New York team rather than a Canadian rival. The incident has reignited debates about Buffalo's place within the "New York sports" identity, given its geographical and cultural proximity to Toronto. The Blue Jays responded positively, sharing a photo of Bills quarterback Josh Allen wearing one of their jerseys.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has thrown the national park system into a state of confusion and disarray, with thousands of employees furloughed and many parks operating with only a skeleton crew.

This situation has left visitors frustrated and has raised concerns among park advocates about the potential for environmental damage and safety risks, echoing problems seen during the 2018 shutdown.

          <p>Small college towns across the United States are facing significant economic and cultural repercussions due to a sharp drop in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Universities like Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have seen their international student populations plummet, resulting in potential revenue losses of over $140 million and impacting local businesses that rely on student spending. The administration's stricter vetting processes and response to campus protests have created a climate of fear, causing many prospective students to choose other countries for their higher education, which threatens the vitality of these communities.</p>

The massive tomb, belonging to a ruler of the 18th Dynasty, was discovered in 1799 but had been looted of its contents. A Japanese-led restoration project has carefully worked to preserve the tomb's structure and renovate the intricate paintings on its walls depicting the pharaoh and ancient gods.

The majority of these cases involve low-income women and allegations of substance use during pregnancy, with prosecutors often using laws intended to protect children, not fetuses. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which grants full legal rights to fetuses and embryos.

Her writings sharply criticize the conservative majority for enabling what she views as unchecked executive power and undermining the rule of law. A particularly notable footnote in her dissent for *Trump v. Casa* referenced a book on the legal structure of Nazi Germany, drawing a parallel that legal experts see as a clear alarm bell.

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist shares a unique parenting practice: creating an email address for each of her children at birth and regularly sending them messages. These emails serve as a digital time capsule, capturing memories, stories, and advice that the children can read when they are older. The expert writes on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to show that love is constant. This practice not only builds a legacy of connection for the children but also provides a journaling outlet for the parent, preserving the ordinary magic of childhood.</p>

          <p>In 1996, David Risher, now the CEO of Lyft, made the risky decision to leave a successful management role at Microsoft to join a small online startup called Amazon. He was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's powerful vision, which included an obsession with the customer experience and an audacious prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Even Bill Gates called the move "the stupidest decision" he'd ever heard. However, Risher was compelled by the opportunity to be part of building a transformative company from its early stages, a decision that proved to be incredibly prescient.</p>

In a film accompanying her new album, Swift described the song as a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that the attention is flattering.
