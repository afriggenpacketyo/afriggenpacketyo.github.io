            <p>California's sea lion population is facing a severe threat from toxic algae blooms, leading to domoic acid poisoning and a surge in rescues. SeaWorld's animal rescue team is overwhelmed, receiving approximately 100 calls a day and doubling its staff to cope with the crisis. Warming oceans, potentially exacerbated by debris from recent wildfires, are believed to contribute to the extreme algae blooms. Rescue teams are working around the clock, hoping to rehabilitate and release affected animals back into the wild.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to exempt smartphones, computers, and other electronics from the recently imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and other countries. This decision comes after concerns were raised by tech companies about potential price increases for consumers. The exemptions, which also cover components like memory cards and semiconductors, are retroactive to April 5th. Experts believe this move will prevent a 'category 5 price storm' for US consumers and alleviate pressure on big tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>While smartphones and computers have been granted a tariff reprieve, many U.S. businesses face potentially irreversible damage from tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned shipments from China, impacting sectors like furniture, toys, apparel, and sports equipment. Experts warn that the high tariffs, totaling 145%, could halt most trade between the U.S. and China, particularly affecting lower-margin goods.

The New Jersey museum opened in June of 2020. Tubman is known as the most famous leader of the Underground Railroad.

            <p>A U.S. missionary pastor, Josh Sullivan, was abducted at gunpoint from his church in South Africa while delivering a sermon. Police and a colleague suspect the abduction is a kidnapping for ransom, a crime that has been increasing in South Africa. Sullivan was holding a prayer meeting with about 30 people when the armed kidnappers entered, taking him and fleeing in his car. Supporters are offering prayers for his safe return, and police are investigating the incident.</p>

            <p>While working on a construction project in Glottertal, Germany, a construction worker discovered a hoard of approximately 1,600 medieval coins dating back to around 1320 AD. The coins, spanning mints in Germany, Switzerland, and France, were deemed valuable enough to purchase 150 sheep at the time. Archaeologists credit the worker's attentiveness for the discovery, which could provide insights into coin circulation, minting activity, and silver trade in the region.</p>

            <p>Amid uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies, Americans are adjusting their spending habits, with some stocking up on goods, delaying purchases, or seeking alternatives. Some are purchasing consumer goods that may be impacted by new tarriffs. Others are reducing subscriptions and future travel plans, while stockpiling kitchen staples. Small business owners are also adapting, with some stocking up on supplies and others noticing a decrease in demand for their services. The disruption could cause a wider re-evaluation of U.S. consumer habits.</p>

            <p>A Washington-based think tank warns that US support for Ukraine has not slowed the provision of American weapons to Taiwan, but there are supply chain problems that need “prudent reforms and substantial new investments”. The report’s authors, Ryan Brobst and Bradley Bowman, warned that US defence industrial bases had been damaged by insufficient spending and that Washington might not be able to sustain the supply of weapons to its partners without a major shift. The Donald Trump administration has pledged a record US$1 trillion in defence spending for next year.</p>

            <p>Alex Garland's new film, Warfare, is a realistic and often horrifying depiction of a battle during the Iraq War. Stripping away the typical plotting of military dramas, the movie focuses on an unembellished skirmish from the 2006 Battle of Ramadi. The film commits to the waiting that exists during battle: the taxing, dull tension of knowing that something might happen any minute. It also features a cast of talented, good-looking young stars on the rise, including Will Poulter, Charles Melton, Noah Centineo, Kit Connor, Joseph Quinn, and Cosmo Jarvis.</p>

            <p>The number of UK residents visiting the US has declined, potentially due to Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Official figures show a 14.3% decrease in March compared to the previous year. Analysts suggest that claims of other countries "cheating" Americans and reports of deportations may be deterring travel to the US. There are concerns that the decline could worsen in the summer, affecting the travel industry and potentially leading to airlines cutting routes.</p>

These workshops produce attack drones equipped with explosives for use on the front lines.

Despite challenges, Ukraine is striving to produce drones entirely from Ukrainian-sourced parts to enhance self-reliance.</p>
