          <p>The article discusses the difficulties of a potential U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.  The Fordo plant, built deep underground, is highly fortified and requires specialized weaponry like the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, only possessed by the U.S., for effective destruction.  Even a successful strike might not completely disable the facilities, necessitating ground forces. The potential for wider conflict and Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region adds significant risk.</p>

The fixed rate and early withdrawal penalties encourage savers to maintain their deposits, unlike other variable-rate accounts. (not investment advice)</p>
