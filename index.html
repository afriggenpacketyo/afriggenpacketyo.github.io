          <p>‘Jeopardy’ host Ken Jennings shared his skepticism about the current state of artificial intelligence, despite having competed against and lost to IBM's Watson supercomputer in 2011. Jennings acknowledges that current large language models surpass Watson's capabilities, but he finds AI-generated content creatively unfulfilling. He emphasizes the importance of human connection and originality in creative fields, contrasting it with what he perceives as soulless 'AI slop'. He also noted the concerns about AI replacing creatives in Hollywood, which was a prominent issue during the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023.</p>

          <p>Reform UK secured a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating the Labour Party by just six votes after a recount, marking a significant win for the right-wing party. Sarah Pochin, the Reform candidate, overturned a substantial Labour majority to claim the seat, which was triggered by the resignation of the previous Labour MP. The victory signals a potential shift in the UK political landscape, with Reform UK positioning itself as a key opposition force. The close result underscores voter dissatisfaction with both Conservative and Labour parties, particularly regarding issues such as winter fuel payments and disability benefits.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made notable gains in recent local elections in the UK, winning its first parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby by a mere six votes and securing its first mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire.

The Conservative party faced considerable losses across the board, highlighting a shift in voter sentiment. Results from remaining mayoral contests and council elections are anticipated, with the Conservatives expected to face further challenges from both Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats.</p>

Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, offering a different mechanism from the prevalent GLP-1 drugs, and early data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially better tolerability. The partnership aims to develop petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset, CT-388, with both companies emphasizing the collaborative nature of the agreement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs. This move aims to protect U.S. manufacturers but is expected to increase prices for consumers who shop online, particularly from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The decision is also driven by concerns about the loophole being used to smuggle fentanyl into the United States. The changes, which apply to shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong, have already caused confusion for consumers and small retailers, while also impacting airlines and private carriers.</p>
