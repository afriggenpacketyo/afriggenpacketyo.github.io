          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House to pursue a lasting peace agreement to end the war with Russia. This follows a summit with Vladimir Putin where the US shifted its focus from a ceasefire to a broader peace deal, a move some analysts believe could give Russia more leverage. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that both sides will need to make concessions, with discussions expected to cover security guarantees, territorial issues, and reconstruction. The meeting occurs amid ongoing Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities, underscoring the urgency of the diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Final arguments have been heard in the landmark national security trial of 77-year-old pro-democracy media founder Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong. Lai faces charges of colluding with foreign forces and sedition, which could result in a life sentence. The case is widely viewed as a test of press freedom and judicial independence in the city following Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law. Prosecutors argued that Lai continued to call for foreign sanctions even after his arrest, while Lai has denied encouraging such actions after the law was enacted.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned that the artificial intelligence market is likely in an investment bubble, comparing the current investor overexcitement to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. While affirming his belief in AI's long-term importance, his comments add to a growing chorus of experts concerned that investment in the sector is moving too quickly and speculatively. Despite these concerns and OpenAI's unprofitability, the company is reportedly preparing a secondary stock sale that would value it at approximately $500 billion, indicating continued strong investor confidence.

          <p>European leaders are joining Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in Washington for talks with President Trump, aiming to align US objectives with their own regarding the war in Ukraine. Their primary goals are to secure robust, NATO-like security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, ensure an end to the ongoing violence, and facilitate a trilateral meeting that includes Zelenskyy in direct negotiations with Trump and Putin. These objectives stem from concerns that the US might push for a peace deal that favors Moscow's position, particularly regarding territorial concessions, following Trump's recent summit with the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>International students studying at U.S. universities are expressing significant anxiety and uncertainty as they begin the new academic year under the Trump administration's stricter immigration and education policies. Many students have described derailed academic plans and are reconsidering their long-term futures in the country due to actions like visa processing delays, travel bans, and increased screenings. The policy shifts have led to projections of a sharp decline in new international student enrollment, which could have a substantial negative financial impact on U.S. universities that rely on their tuition fees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scholars and former officials argue that President Trump is undermining truth by dismissing officials who present facts that contradict his narratives, a behavior described as having the "hallmarks of authoritarianism." The recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner for releasing an unflattering economic report is cited as a key example of this trend. Critics note that loyalists in key agencies are also promoting "alternative facts" and pushing policies that reject widely accepted science, particularly on issues like climate change, creating an environment where objective information is politically penalized.</p>

          <p>The "great resignation" has reportedly been replaced by the "great stay," a phenomenon consultants are calling "job hugging," where employees hold onto their current positions due to economic uncertainty. This trend is a reversal of the high job-hopping rates seen in 2021 and 2022, reflecting a cooled labor market where hiring and quit rates have fallen to multi-year lows. While providing stability, experts warn that job hugging can lead to stagnated wage growth and skill development for workers, and may make it more difficult for new entrants, like recent graduates, to find employment.

          <p>Cole Walliser, the director behind E!'s Glambot since 2016, discusses the high-speed camera's role as a red carpet staple for awards season. He explains how the Glambot's candid, one-second slow-motion clips break down barriers with celebrities and create perfect short-form content for social media, a strategy he adopted early on. Walliser believes the feature remains relevant despite the rise of influencers and celebrities controlling their own content, as it provides a unique, professionally captured moment that stars are eager to share, ensuring its place in the evolving entertainment landscape.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Laments the Growing Homogeneity of Restaurant Menus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece criticizes a trend toward homogeneity in restaurant menus, where many establishments feature the same popular, risk-averse dishes like avocado toast, mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts. The author argues that this "greatest-hits" approach, driven by a desire to appeal to the widest possible audience, stifles culinary creativity and diversity. The writer contrasts these generic menus with the authenticity found in ethnic restaurants, which often serve as portals for immigrant culture, and laments that the current focus on popularity leads to a less interesting and more constrained dining landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new, vigorously researched biography of James Baldwin by Nicholas Boggs, titled "Baldwin: A Love Story," explores the deep connections between the author's search for love and the source of his artistic power. The book details how Baldwin's experiences as a Black, gay man shaped his seminal works, arguing that his complex romantic relationships were a rich source for his fiction. By unearthing new information, including a previously uncited long-term partner, the biography makes a strong case for the literary merit of Baldwin's later novels and is positioned to become the new standard for Baldwin studies.</p>

          <p>The percentage of dogs in California testing positive for exposure to anaplasmosis, a tick-borne bacterial disease, has nearly tripled in the last five years. This sharp increase is raising public health concerns, as dogs often act as sentinels for diseases that can also infect humans. Experts suggest that climate change is allowing the ticks that carry the disease to expand into new areas, including Southern California. While the illness is treatable with antibiotics in both dogs and people, the trend highlights a growing and potentially under-recognized health risk in the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of active short-term rental listings, such as those on Airbnb and VRBO, has decreased in Los Angeles over the past year. This decline is attributed to the city's increasingly strict Home-Sharing Ordinance, which includes new enforcement tools and the threat of significant fines for violations. Some property owners are reportedly removing their listings out of fear of penalties, while others are shifting to mid-term rentals (stays of 30 days or more) to avoid the regulations and the hassle of frequent tenant turnover, signaling a potential shift in the local rental market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite some public calls for Los Angeles to cancel its hosting of the 2028 Olympic Games, the city is bound by a legally airtight host city contract with the International Olympic Committee. The article explains that there is no provision for the city to unilaterally withdraw, and doing so would expose it to billions of dollars in lawsuits and damages. Unlike Denver's withdrawal from the 1976 Winter Games, the modern Olympics are a massive financial and logistical undertaking, making a last-minute relocation unfeasible. L.A.'s existing infrastructure and long preparation time further solidify its role as host.</p>
