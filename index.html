          <p>LG Energy Solution, a major South Korean battery manufacturer, has announced a significant $4.3 billion supply agreement with an undisclosed major corporation. The contract, effective from July 2025 to July 2030, is for lithium iron phosphate batteries, though it's unclear if they are for electric vehicles or energy storage systems. While the counterparty remains confidential, reports suggest it may be Tesla, following a similar pattern of undisclosed deals with other South Korean tech firms. The company has cautioned investors that the deal's terms are subject to change.</p>

          <p>A major 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami warnings for Hawaii and parts of Alaska, with advisories for the entire U.S. West Coast. Japan experienced initial waves of about one foot, while Russian coastal towns reported damage and conducted evacuations. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center forecast potentially damaging waves up to 10 feet in some areas, prompting evacuations in Honolulu. The event is one of the strongest earthquakes recorded globally since the 2011 Japan quake.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will allow local governments in the Los Angeles area to bypass a state duplex law in neighborhoods prone to wildfires. The order comes after pressure from officials in Los Angeles and Malibu, who raised concerns about increased population density in high-risk fire zones. The 2021 law, SB 9, permitted up to four housing units on single-family lots, but the new order will exempt areas recently affected by fires. This move aims to prevent straining evacuation routes and infrastructure during future emergencies.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has declared it will recognize a Palestinian state by September unless Israel takes substantial steps to end the war in Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "affect the situation on the ground" and push for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. The decision has drawn criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism. Domestically, the policy shift was welcomed by some but criticized by opposition parties for being either too conditional or poorly timed.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the action as the largest deregulatory move in U.S. history, claiming it would save Americans billions annually. If finalized, the repeal would eliminate regulations on emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources. Environmental groups and former EPA officials have condemned the decision, calling it a dangerous reversal of climate policy that ignores scientific consensus and will be challenged in court.</p>

The export-dependent nation, which manages its economy by adjusting its currency's exchange rate, is holding its position after two earlier policy easings.

Bonta suggests the legislature could draw new maps designed to favor Democrats, which could net the party several seats.

          <p>Attorneys for Sean "Diddy" Combs have filed a motion requesting his release from federal prison on a $50 million bond as he awaits his October sentencing. Combs was recently convicted on two prostitution-related charges but acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering counts. His lawyers argue that mandatory detention is unwarranted for his convictions, claiming he is not a flight risk and faces threats of violence in the Brooklyn detention center. The motion also frames his past behavior as part of a consensual "swinger" lifestyle, a claim made in the context of arguing for his pre-sentencing release.</p>

The charity, Survivors' Network, was sued by a woman who felt unsafe in a support group that included a trans woman. In a pre-trial agreement, the charity will now run the new group alongside its existing, trans-inclusive sessions. This decision comes after a UK Supreme Court ruling clarified that single-sex services can be reserved for people of the same biological sex, providing a path to resolution in this contentious case.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have moved to drop charges in two high-profile cases shortly after the Trump administration extended the term of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. The dismissed cases include a major fraud indictment against the ex-CEO of the Fatburger chain, a Trump donor, and an excessive force conviction against an L.A. County sheriff's deputy. These actions have fueled controversy, with allegations that Essayli's appointment and subsequent decisions were politically motivated. The dismissal of the deputy's conviction, in particular, had previously led to the resignation of several prosecutors in protest of lenient treatment.</p>

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited a complex and polarized online debate, highlighting the dysfunctional nature of modern internet discourse. The ad's "jeans/genes" pun was interpreted by some as an obtuse or even nefarious nod to eugenics, while others dismissed the outrage as hysterical overreaction. This article argues that the controversy is a symptom of a broken information ecosystem where genuine political anxieties are stripped of context and transformed into an attention spectacle. The cycle feeds outrage, reactionary content, and media clicks, ultimately grinding down meaningful conversation into meaningless algorithmic grist.</p>

          <p>An ophthalmologist is issuing a strong warning about the dangers of sleeping with contact lenses, describing the habit as "a game of Russian roulette" for eye health. Sleeping in contacts, even for a nap, dramatically increases the risk of a corneal ulcer, a serious infection that can lead to permanent vision loss or even the loss of an eye. The expert also advises against exposing lenses to any nonsterile water, including showering or rinsing them with tap water, as this can trap bacteria against the cornea. Forgetting lens solution is not an excuse; it is safer to discard the lenses than risk a severe infection.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to repeal the EPA's "endangerment finding" for greenhouse gases is a major blow to federal climate policy, but it may strengthen California's role as a regulatory leader. The finding is the legal basis for many federal emissions rules, and its reversal could dismantle them. However, experts suggest this could create a legal opening for California to assert its own state-level authority to regulate emissions more aggressively, as much of its climate legislation predates the federal finding.
