          <p>The UK is bracing for potentially record-breaking temperatures, with forecasts predicting highs of 33C. The Met Office anticipates that Friday could surpass Thursday's record as the hottest day of the year. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant impacts on health and social care services, particularly for the elderly and those with health conditions. Many regions are expected to meet heatwave criteria, with temperatures sustaining above threshold for three consecutive days, while some relief is expected on Sunday as temperatures cool slightly. </p>

          <p>Kaori Sakamoto, a three-time world champion in figure skating, has announced her plans to retire from competition following the next Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. The 25-year-old Japanese skater, who won a bronze medal at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games and finished second at the world championships in Boston, revealed her decision at the opening ceremony for a new skating rink in her hometown of Kobe. Sakamoto expressed that she feels she has less than a year left in her competitive career, citing her age at the subsequent Olympics in 2030 as a determining factor. Sakamoto made her Olympic debut at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and secured her fourth consecutive Japanese championship last December.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US appeals court has ruled that former US President Donald Trump can maintain control over National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The court stated that while a president's power is not unlimited, Trump's administration provided a defensible rationale for the deployment to protect federal personnel and property. This ruling halts a lower court's decision to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, who criticized Trump's decision as an authoritarian move to quell anti-immigration protests. Trump celebrated the ruling as a "BIG WIN," asserting his authority to provide protection where state and local police are unable to do so.</p>

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party is urging local governments to carefully implement restrictions on lavish banquets, following concerns from the food and beverage industry. The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, stated that frugality rules are meant to curb extravagant practices, not ordinary dining. Some local governments were scrutinizing every meal and canceling official receptions, which has complicated understanding of the regulations and negatively impacted the catering industry. The curbs on excessive official meals began in May after the Central Committee and State Council released regulations banning high-end dishes, cigarettes, and liquor at government events.</p>

China's customs agency has also highlighted instances of stopping Labubu copycats from crossing the border.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump did not acknowledge Juneteenth this year, despite honoring the holiday in each of his first four years as president, even before it became a federal holiday. When asked about Trump's plans, the White House press secretary stated that she was not tracking his signature on a proclamation. This silence contrasts with his previous statements invoking the importance of the day for Black Americans, celebrating the end of slavery. Trump later complained about "too many non-working holidays" costing the country billions, despite most retailers being open on Juneteenth.</p>

          <p>A contentious series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres culminated in a benches-clearing incident and ejections of both managers.

After Shohei Ohtani was also hit by a pitch later in the inning, Padres closer Robert Suarez was ejected, and the Padres ultimately held on for a 5-3 victory.

          <p>The recent exchange of fire between Israel and Iran has highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, leading to renewed discussions about the proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system in the United States. While the Golden Dome project faces questions regarding its cost and viability, some experts argue that Israel's success underscores the urgent need to strengthen U.S. missile defenses. Private space companies are vying for a role in the Golden Dome project, particularly after a feud between Elon Musk and former President Trump raised questions about SpaceX's involvement. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed allocating billions for missile defense and space programs in support of the Golden Dome effort.</p>

Early detection and treatment, ideally before age seven, are crucial for effective correction of the condition, which involves patching the stronger eye.

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2Â½ times. The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, delaying rot by almost a week or more, at a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. Tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, the coating offers an eco-friendly alternative to existing preservation methods by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and potential toxicity. This innovation addresses critical challenges in perishable fruit preservation and offers a promising solution to global food waste.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge in rice prices comes as Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, reaching its highest level since January 2023. The government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate the price of this staple food. Experts suggest that future inflation trends heavily rely on food prices, particularly rice, and government measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending if they extend to processed foods and restaurant prices.

However, some see the tournament as a valuable opportunity for national team players to acclimate to the weather, travel, and atmosphere they can expect at the World Cup next year.</p>

          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, has claimed to have fathered more than 100 children through sperm donation, in addition to being the "official father" of six other children with three different partners. Durov stated that all of his offspring will share his estimated $13.9 billion fortune, but none will have access to their inheritance for 30 years. He wants them to live like normal people, build themselves up alone, and learn to trust themselves. The 40-year-old said he has written a will now because his job involves risks, as defending freedoms earns you many enemies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's efforts to attract investment risk undermining corporate spending, with the Nippon Steel-US Steel deal illustrating the growing vulnerability of businesses in the US market. Analysts suggest that the US administration's earlier blocking of the takeover was politically motivated, leading companies to reconsider sizeable investments in the US. Despite Trump's approval of the buyout, Nippon Steel is now obligated to invest $11 billion by 2028 and faces government veto power over key management decisions. The situation underscores the increasing involvement of governments in economic and business matters through industrial policy.</p>

          <p>China has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures last month, as a trade deal with the US eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. Last month, Chinese authorities cut the lending rates for the first time since October, in their bid to cushion the impact from trade tensions with Washington. Fears of a trade war have receded after US and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva in May, allowing for rare earth and tech trade.

The summit comes after President Donald Trump made modest gains with Black voters in 2024, and organizers hope to foster long-term talent and leadership development within the conservative movement. Speakers include Lynne Patton, Rep. Wesley Hunt, and Alice Johnson.</p>
