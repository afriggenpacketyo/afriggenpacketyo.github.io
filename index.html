          <p>Authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have confiscated eighteen lions that were being kept illegally as pets. The crackdown was initiated after a lion escaped from a home in Lahore last week and attacked a woman and two children, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Keeping exotic animals like lions is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite being an offense punishable by jail time. Officials plan to inspect over 500 lions and tigers held in private homes and breeding farms.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody was a suicide, and found no evidence of a secret "client list" for blackmail purposes. The review, which analyzed over 300 gigabytes of data, confirmed Epstein harmed over a thousand victims but did not uncover evidence to predicate new investigations against uncharged third parties. The DOJ also released security footage showing no one entered Epstein's cell area, aiming to debunk widespread conspiracy theories surrounding his death.</p>

          <p>Lithuania's central bank, Robinhood's lead regulator in the European Union, is seeking clarification on the company's new tokenized stock product. The inquiry follows a public warning from OpenAI, which stated that Robinhood's "OpenAI tokens" are not actual company equity and that it had no partnership with the trading platform. Robinhood had launched tokens offering EU users indirect exposure to private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX.

          <p>The practice of federal immigration agents wearing masks and balaclavas during enforcement raids in Los Angeles is causing public alarm and confusion. Critics, including former ICE officials, argue that masked, plainclothed agents are difficult to distinguish from criminals, creating a dangerous situation for the public and undermining accountability. Defenders of the practice cite officer safety, pointing to increased threats and doxing on social media. The tactic has led to calls for legislation requiring federal officers to be clearly identifiable during operations.</p>

However, Wall Street remains concerned about the company's AI progress, particularly with Siri, which has fallen behind competitors like ChatGPT.

According to the IDF, the Houthis had fitted the captured ship with a radar system and were using it as a floating observation platform to aid their attacks on maritime vessels.
