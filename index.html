          <h2>China's State Media Warns of Competitiveness Decline Due to 'Involution' Trap</h2>

          <p>Chinese state media is again expressing concerns about 'involution' (neijuan), a self-defeating cycle of excessive competition, which they fear is hurting the nation's economic competitiveness. The Economic Daily warns that this phenomenon traps entities in a vicious cycle of low prices and ineffective competition, ultimately damaging industries. The commentary urges local governments and businesses to focus on long-term economic health rather than short-term gains, such as unsustainable policies and excessive price wars, to foster sustainable growth and innovation.</p>

The universities argue against government overreach and the coercive use of public research funding, emphasizing their commitment to academic freedom and the exchange of ideas without fear of retribution.
