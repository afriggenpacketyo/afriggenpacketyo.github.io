          <p>NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt Jr. and NFL quarterback Lamar Jackson are engaged in a legal battle over the trademark of the number 8. Jackson filed trademark registrations for "ERA 8" in 2019, while Earnhardt Jr. is attempting to trademark the number itself, stylized in the fashion it was on his race car. Jackson argues that Earnhardt's application conflicts with his trademarks and falsely suggests a connection between the two, potentially damaging his brand. This is not Jackson's first time defending his trademark, as he faced a similar battle with Troy Aikman over the word "eight."</p>

          <p>The IRS is planning to cut up to 25% of its workforce, starting with the Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, in an effort to increase efficiency. The agency intends to implement the reduction in phases, offering early retirement incentives to employees.

          <p>New York state officials have informed the Trump administration that they will not comply with demands to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices in public schools, despite threats to terminate federal education funding.

          <p>Donald Trump's announcement of punitive tariffs on imports has sparked immediate market reactions and raised concerns about a potential global recession. The long-term implications depend on the permanence of these tariffs and whether they are used to pressure countries into complying with U.S. demands. The UK government faces challenges in negotiating a trade deal that reduces tariffs on British exports to the U.S. A global recession could significantly impact British economic growth, requiring difficult tax, spending, and borrowing choices.</p>

          <p>Economists are challenging the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it's based on flawed assumptions and inflates the rates. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the formula involves dividing the country's trade deficit with the U.S. by its exports, then dividing by two, with a 10% baseline tariff. Economists argue that the elasticity rate used in the formula is lower than it should be, leading to exaggerated tariff rates for various nations.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has cautioned that Trump's tariffs could lead to a Republican "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if they cause a recession. Cruz expressed concerns that the tariffs, if maintained and met with global retaliation, could trigger a trade war that damages the U.S. economy. He warned that a recession would likely result in a Democrat-controlled House and possibly the Senate. Cruz emphasized the need for lower tariffs abroad and at home to benefit American workers, businesses, and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Empty nesters are being encouraged to consider becoming foster carers, with those who have already made the move sharing positive experiences. The children's minister has urged empty nesters to help address a decline in the number of foster carers. Foster carers provide a home to children who cannot live with their birth families, and those who have taken on the role later in life say they have "a huge amount to offer". The Fostering Network estimates a shortage of 5,000 foster carers in England.</p>

          <p>Michigan has joined 18 other states in filing a lawsuit against President Trump's election order, arguing that it violates the Constitution. The lawsuit seeks to block key aspects of the order, including requirements for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and demanding that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. The states argue that the order infringes on their authority to run their own elections. The White House defends the order as a necessary measure to ensure free, fair, and honest elections.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Formula Misrepresents Global Trade, Experts Argue</h2>

          <p>Economic experts are criticizing the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariffs, stating that it misrepresents global trade economics. The formula, which involves dividing a nation's trade deficit with the U.S. by its imports and then halving the result, is seen as flawed and lacking a sound economic basis. Experts argue that trade deficits are influenced by financial markets and not solely by import demand, making the formula unlikely to achieve its intended results. They also express concern that the tariffs could lead to trade wars.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs Threaten to Disrupt Korean Beauty Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are threatening to disrupt the Korean beauty (K-beauty) market in the United States. The tariffs, including a 25 percent hike on goods imported from South Korea, have prompted beauty enthusiasts to stock up on their favorite products. The tariffs may test the strength of the K-beauty brand in America, as brands will have to decide if they think it’ll keep growing. If the tariff succeeds and more K-beauty is soon made in America, the industry could lose its major selling point: it is not made in America.</p>
