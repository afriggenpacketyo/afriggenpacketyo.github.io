          <p>A commemorative train ride from Chicago to Mississippi is marking 70 years since Emmett Till's brutal lynching, an event that ignited the modern Civil Rights Movement. Family members, including Till's cousin and last surviving eyewitness Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., participated in the solemn journey, emphasizing the importance of remembering history to acknowledge progress and the ongoing need for healing. The event highlights Till's mother's decision for an open casket funeral, which powerfully exposed the era's racial violence. Despite the passage of time and the later confession from Carolyn Bryant that her allegations were false, the family stresses that Till's death was not in vain.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating between China and the Philippines at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, with a Chinese tugboat sighted near the grounded BRP Sierra Madre and Chinese coastguard ships intercepting Philippine vessels. The Philippine Navy states that the tugboat is insufficient to remove their ship, while satellite data confirms recent interceptions. Experts note a return to heightened tensions after a period of relative coexistence. The situation remains volatile as a resupply deadline looms, underscoring the ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased an ace-like pitching performance for the Dodgers, completing five innings of one-run ball and recording nine strikeouts in a 5-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. This marked a significant step in his return to two-way duties post-Tommy John surgery, as he demonstrated the ability to work deep into a game by effectively utilizing a diverse pitch repertoire. Ohtani's strategic shift to incorporating more secondary pitches, particularly his curveball, kept the Reds off-balance throughout his 87-pitch outing. His performance secures his first pitching win of the season and offers a glimpse into his potential crucial role in the postseason rotation.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a morning Mass, marking the start of the school year, left two children dead and 17 others injured, including 14 children. The shooter, Robin Westman, who had legally purchased the weapons, died by self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing through church windows. Law enforcement is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, though a specific motive is yet to be confirmed. The community is reeling from the "deliberate act of violence against innocent children," with calls for action to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to continue their century-old football rivalry, following public concern over its potential end.

Both institutions acknowledge the rivalry's importance, but USC prioritizes its program's best interests in national championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>The European Union is enduring its worst wildfire season on record, with a million hectares burned so far this year, primarily in Spain and Portugal. Roughly 1% of the Iberian Peninsula has been scorched, with Spain seeing six times its average burn area and Portugal nearly five times. Climate change is directly linked to the worsening fire conditions, leading to more extreme heat and dried vegetation, which in turn releases record levels of CO2. Experts warn that rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land also contribute by increasing flammable vegetation, exacerbating the challenge for fire-hardy ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Capitol Hill is addressing a surge in politically motivated violence, with nearly 9,500 threats against Congress reported in 2024, prompting bipartisan concern. A new pilot program offers lawmakers increased funding for home security upgrades and personal security, running through the 2025 fiscal year. This initiative follows recent violent incidents, including an assassination attempt on President Trump and fatal shootings targeting Minnesota state lawmakers. Representatives from both parties express heightened vigilance and fear, emphasizing that political violence is a non-partisan issue requiring collective action to tone down rhetoric and ensure safety for public officials.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two employees from an Ontario surgery center, Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, on felony charges of assaulting and interfering with US immigration officers. The incident occurred when landscapers, allegedly unauthorized immigrants, sought refuge in the facility during an ICE raid. Court documents detail how the staffers allegedly physically obstructed agents attempting to detain individuals, with video footage showing them demanding warrants and trying to prevent arrests. This indictment reflects an aggressive prosecutorial stance against those who interfere with ICE operations.</p>

          <p>The value of pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks has plummeted, with average prices down nearly 30% from last year, a trend experts call "unprecedented." This decline reflects a broader hit to all used Tesla vehicles and follows a massive decrease in new car sales for 2025. Critics point to CEO Elon Musk and the vehicle's release price, which doubled initial estimates, as contributing factors. The company even stopped accepting Cybertrucks as trade-ins earlier this year, signaling a troubled market reception for the much-hyped vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern California and the Central Valley are expected to experience more intense dust storms, known as haboobs, due to climate change, water overuse, and other environmental factors. These storms, like those that reached Los Angeles in 2022 and 2023, pose serious health risks by carrying disease- and chemical-laden particles, including pesticides and heavy metals, that affect human lungs and trigger asthma. UC researchers have formed a consortium, UC Dust, to improve forecasting and understand the health impacts, as millions of Californians remain vulnerable to these difficult-to-predict environmental hazards.</p>

FEMA defended its actions, calling signatories "bureaucrats" resistant to reform and emphasizing accountability to survivors. The suspensions, described as non-disciplinary, come amidst the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and reflect ongoing tensions over the agency's direction and staffing.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging eligible parents in England to apply for expanded government-funded childcare hours, set to increase to 30 hours a week for children aged nine months to four years from September. The initiative aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare, which averaged £12,425 annually for under-twos in 2025. Despite the expansion, concerns persist about the availability of staff and places, with some nurseries struggling financially and potentially withdrawing from the scheme due to insufficient funding rates and "top-up" fees. The government is also addressing disparities in place distribution and a decline in childminders.</p>
