          <p>Shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, an ether treasury company, surged over 19% following the disclosure that billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, had acquired a 9% stake. The investment, aimed at establishing Bitmine as a significant player in the ether space, also lifted the stock prices of other crypto-focused firms. This market enthusiasm is further fueled by recent positive developments, including Robinhood's expansion in Europe and renewed optimism for the passage of a key stablecoin bill in the U.S. Congress.

          <p>Westinghouse's interim CEO, Dan Sumner, revealed a plan to President Donald Trump to build ten large AP1000 nuclear reactors in the U.S., with construction slated to begin by 2030. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value nationwide. This announcement aligns with President Trump's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The plan comes despite the company's previous project at Plant Vogtle facing significant budget overruns and delays, which led to its bankruptcy before a 2018 restructuring.</p>

          <p>A nurse, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife after she was suspended for complaining about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. The internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support allegations that included failures of patient care and misgendering her colleague. The decision was announced as an employment tribunal, where Ms. Peggie is suing the health board under the Equality Act, resumed. The case highlights ongoing debates in Scotland regarding transgender rights and the legal definition of sex, particularly following a recent UK Supreme Court ruling.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold another 225,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $37 million, as part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March.

The company also announced it plans to restart sales of its H20 chips to China after the Trump administration indicated it would approve the necessary export licenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This flat reading, which was also seen in the core PPI, suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had only a marginal impact on prices so far. However, the report contained conflicting signals, as final demand goods prices rose 0.3%, offset by a drop in services costs. While the annual PPI rate slowed, the data provides a complex picture for the Federal Reserve as it weighs future interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

This reluctance is largely due to homeowners not wanting to give up the historically low mortgage rates they secured before 2022 for today's much higher rates.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly called for the Department of Justice to release all documents related to the deceased financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This position creates a rare point of friction with President Trump, who has dismissed the issue as a waste of time. Johnson's call comes amid growing pressure from some conservatives who are dissatisfied with the administration's handling of the case and its conclusion that there was no client list to be made public. The Speaker argued that everything should be put out for the public to decide.</p>

          <p>According to Germany's Federal Statistics Office, the number of people living alone in the country has reached 17 million, representing 20.6% of the population. This marks a significant increase from two decades ago when the figure was just 14 million. Single-person households are now the most common household type in Germany and are projected to exceed 45% by 2040. The data also highlights social downsides, with one in four solo dwellers reporting feelings of loneliness, and single people facing a nearly doubled risk of poverty compared to the general population.</p>

          <p>The multibillion-dollar influencer industry is facing economic turbulence as recession fears and tariff policies make both brands and audiences more cautious with their spending. Consumers are reportedly pushing back against content displaying excessive wealth, leading to a decline in trust. In response, brands are recalibrating their advertising budgets, with fewer planning to allocate significant funds to influencer marketing compared to last year. This economic pressure may force creators to pivot their content away from consumption-heavy posts and toward more relatable, budget-conscious themes to maintain their audience and income streams.</p>

The prize includes a $500,000 grant, which Philbin has chosen to direct to NPR and its Los Angeles member stations, KCRW and LAist, to support freedom of the press. This symbolic financial boost comes as public broadcasting faces a potential freeze of federal funding under a rescission bill proposed by the White House.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation accelerated in June, rising 2.7% on an annual basis and 0.3% from the previous month. This annual rate is the highest since February and suggests that President Trump's tariffs may be starting to impact consumer prices, particularly for goods like food and apparel. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 2.9% annually. The data complicates the economic landscape and makes it highly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will consider an interest rate cut at its upcoming July meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

However, downsides include limited product selection, purchase quantity limits, and a no-return policy, and Costco does not buy back the gold.

However, money market accounts offer greater liquidity, making them ideal for emergency funds that need to be accessed without penalty.

          <p>Professional cycling teams at the 2025 Tour de France are increasingly incorporating heat training into their preparation, not just to acclimate to warm weather but to boost overall performance. Sports scientists explain that raising an athlete's core body temperature to a mild, fever-like state can increase blood volume and improve oxygen delivery to muscles. This can be achieved actively, by wearing heavy clothing during training, or passively through saunas. Some experts suggest that heat training can be more effective and accessible than traditional altitude training for enhancing athletic endurance.</p>
