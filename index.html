        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has once again postponed its announcement regarding the Northern Powerhouse Rail project, a high-speed line intended to connect northern English cities like Liverpool and Manchester. The delay is reportedly due to concerns over long-term costs and a desire to avoid the planning mistakes that have plagued the HS2 project. Originally proposed in 2014, the project is seen as crucial for boosting the regional economy outside of London. A government source stated they remain committed to the project but are taking extra time to ensure the plans are thoroughly reviewed before proceeding, with an update expected in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>The renowned chaplain for the Loyola University Ramblers men's basketball team, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, has retired from her duties at the age of 106. Her retirement, prompted by health concerns, marks the end of an era for the university where she became an international celebrity during the team's 2018 Final Four run. Sister Jean began her tenure at Loyola in 1991 after its merger with Mundelein College, later serving as a crucial academic advisor and spiritual guide for student-athletes. In a final message, she encouraged students to pursue their dreams and become future leaders, leaving behind a celebrated legacy of dedication and inspiration.</p>

          <p>The family of a victim from the fatal January collision between an American Airlines plane and an Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit. The suit names the FAA, the Army, and the airline, alleging they failed to address risks despite over 30 prior near-misses in the area. This is the first of an expected 60 lawsuits from families of the 67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. plane crash since 2001. The National Transportation Safety Board's ongoing investigation has already identified multiple contributing factors, including inadequate separation between flight paths and overworked air traffic controllers, highlighting systemic failures.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and critically injuring a third. The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on a nearby rooftop. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, noting that unspent shell casings found at the scene were engraved with anti-ICE messages. The attack prompted strong condemnation from Homeland Security officials, who linked the violence to heated political rhetoric surrounding the agency and its immigration enforcement operations across the country.</p>

          <p>Betty Reid Soskin, the oldest park ranger in U.S. history, celebrated her 104th birthday at a Bay Area middle school named in her honor. Soskin gained national recognition in her 80s as a ranger at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, where she shared stories of African Americans during World War II, particularly the Port Chicago explosion. An activist who stood against Jim Crow laws in the East Bay, she has become a symbol of civic engagement and community impact.

          <p>The first family, consisting of three people, has arrived in the United Kingdom under the new "one in, one out" migrant agreement with France. This pilot scheme allows the UK to return a migrant who crossed the Channel illegally for every refugee with a valid protection case that it accepts from France. So far, four migrants who arrived by small boat have been removed from the UK under this program. The government hopes the policy will deter people-smuggling gangs, though it has faced criticism from political opponents who question its effectiveness and from rights groups who advocate for more safe and legal routes for asylum seekers.</p>

While such programs can expand market reach, they also carry risks, as subprime borrowers are more likely to default on loans, particularly during economic downturns.

For a $250,000 mortgage, this new rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs has spurred an increase in mortgage applications from both new homebuyers and existing homeowners looking to refinance.

The vehement reaction to his killing, Greer suggests, stems from a belief on the right that the left has created a culture where such violence is permissible.

One family reported their nonverbal son began speaking just days after starting the treatment.

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals a 70% increase in infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" in the United States. The rise is primarily driven by a gene known as NDM, which makes bacteria resistant to carbapenems, a class of last-resort antibiotics. The rate of NDM cases surged by 460% between 2019 and 2023, a trend researchers find highly worrisome. Experts suggest the increase may be linked to a surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <h2>Honda Ceases Production of Acura ZDX Electric Vehicle Built by General Motors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 13:46:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Honda Motor has officially canceled all future production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which was being assembled at a General Motors plant in Tennessee. The decision was attributed to changing market conditions and a desire to align its product portfolio with customer needs and long-term strategy. While production of the ZDX is ending, Honda will continue its partnership with GM on another EV, the Honda Prologue, which is built in Mexico. Honda plans to launch a new all-electric Acura RSX in 2026, which will be produced at its own EV facility in Ohio, signaling a shift in its electric vehicle manufacturing strategy.</p>

          <p>During his speech at the UN, President Donald Trump made several claims about the United Kingdom, including that London is on the verge of adopting sharia law under its "terrible" mayor, Sadiq Khan. There is no evidence to support this claim, which appears to stem from long-running right-wing memes. Trump also asserted that the UK has abandoned its "powerful edge" in North Sea oil due to high taxes, claiming vast reserves remain undiscovered. However, regulators project that 90% of future production will come from existing fields, and the basin's reserves are limited, challenging the president's assessment of the UK's energy situation.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has launched an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers from hotels to appointments such as doctor visits. The action follows a BBC investigation that uncovered long-distance journeys costing taxpayers hundreds of pounds, including one 250-mile trip that reportedly cost £600. While asylum seekers receive a weekly bus pass, taxis are booked for other necessary travel without public transport being presented as an option. The report has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum, highlighting concerns over wasteful spending and the broader issues within the UK's for-profit asylum accommodation system.</p>

          <p>Clashes between police and protesters in India's northern Himalayan territory of Ladakh have resulted in at least four deaths and dozens of injuries. The demonstrations were sparked by demands for greater autonomy, statehood, and job quotas for local residents after the region's special status was revoked in 2019. The unrest was reportedly triggered by speeches from activist Sonam Wangchuck, who is on a hunger strike. Authorities stated that police resorted to firing in self-defense after a political office and a police vehicle were set on fire. In response, the government has imposed restrictions on public gatherings to quell the violence.</p>

          <p>Shortly after its release, the new Apple iPhone 17 series is facing a controversy dubbed 'scratchgate,' as numerous early users report that the phone's body is highly susceptible to scratches. The issue appears to affect all models, including the Pro and Pro Max, and is attributed to the anodized aluminum frame. When the top colored layer is damaged, it exposes the silver aluminum underneath, making scratches very noticeable. Additionally, a prominent tech reviewer pointed out that the camera bump on the Pro models has a sharp edge, making it prone to chipping. Experts suggest the damage is permanent, recommending a protective case as the only solution.</p>

          <p>Doctors and public health officials are criticizing President Trump's suggestion that pregnant women should "tough it out" and avoid acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. The president's comments linked the drug to autism risk without new evidence, contradicting existing data. Medical experts warn this advice could be harmful, as untreated high fevers during pregnancy are associated with developmental issues in babies, and pain can also pose risks. They emphasize that acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter pain and fever reducer for pregnant women, and that avoiding it could lead patients to use riskier alternatives like ibuprofen or aspirin, which are known to be dangerous during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed Reese's candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the wrappers depicted artistic details, such as carved faces on pumpkins and ghosts, which were absent on the actual chocolate products. However, U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled that the consumers failed to demonstrate they suffered economic harm. She noted that while the appearance may have been disappointing, the candies were not worthless and still provided the value of being edible chocolate, and the complaint was based on subjective expectations rather than a concrete injury.</p>

While the pivot from appeasement to a more deterrence-focused approach is seen as a positive development, the editorial warns that it is highly unreliable.

Hastings was exonerated in 2022 after new DNA evidence identified the real perpetrator, who died in prison in 2020. A civil rights lawsuit revealed that an Inglewood detective had allegedly falsified evidence and ignored information that corroborated Hastings' alibi, effectively framing him for the crime.

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose by 20.5% in August, reaching the fastest pace since early 2022. This unexpected surge is largely attributed to homebuilders offering significant price discounts and other incentives to attract buyers who have been sidelined by affordability issues. Easing mortgage rates, in anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, also contributed to the increase in activity. While this signals a potential thaw in the housing market, analysts caution that the data is often volatile and new homes represent only a small fraction of total sales, with the broader market still constrained by high prices and borrowing costs.
