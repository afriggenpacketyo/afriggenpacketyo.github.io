        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's prolonged conflict against Maoist rebels, officially known as Left-Wing Extremism, has seen a significant escalation with the government aiming to end the insurgency by March 2026. This intensified containment strategy has led to over 600 alleged rebels being killed in the past year, particularly in Chhattisgarh, a central Indian state with a large tribal population. While authorities assert the necessity and effectiveness of these operations, human rights activists voice grave concerns over the severe human cost. The article details tragic instances of civilians, including Pekaram Mettami's son and Arjun Potam's brother, dying amidst the conflict, with locals alleging wrongful killings and a blurring of lines between rebels and innocent villagers. The situation highlights the ongoing suffering of tribal communities caught in the protracted struggle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a public health alert for specific ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's, warning of potential listeria contamination. This listeria strain is linked to a previous deadly outbreak associated with chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals, which resulted in four fatalities and twenty illnesses. Affected products include Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce from Walmart and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, identified by specific best-by dates and establishment numbers. Although no illnesses have been reported directly from these newly identified products, consumers are strongly advised to discard them and can receive a full refund. The investigation points to pasta from a third-party supplier as the likely source of the contamination.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump reportedly fired Michele Beckwith, the acting US attorney in Sacramento, just hours after she instructed Border Patrol agents to comply with a federal court order prohibiting indiscriminate detentions during immigration raids. Beckwith emphasized adherence to constitutional rights, a stance that contradicted the Border Patrol unit chief's view, who later proceeded with a raid. This incident follows a Supreme Court decision overturning a similar order in Los Angeles, allowing agents to stop people based on race, language, or job. Beckwith's termination is part of a pattern of federal prosecutors being removed for not aligning with the president's agenda, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly terminated a group of agents who participated in a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., during June 2020, in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. Many of these agents, primarily from the FBI's Washington Field Office, were photographed kneeling at the demonstration. Although some had been reassigned earlier this year, sources familiar with the situation indicate that up to 20 agents have now been fired for their involvement. The FBI has officially declined to comment on these terminations. This development brings into focus the complex issues surrounding federal employee conduct at protests and the implications for free speech within law enforcement agencies, particularly concerning events of significant national importance.</p>

While he is expected to pitch most of next season, his absence creates another hole in the struggling bullpen. The team is also managing other injuries, including Will Smith's fractured hand and Tommy Edman's sore ankle. This development underscores the challenges the Dodgers face in stabilizing their relief pitching as they prepare for the postseason.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted three women on charges of conspiracy and publicly disclosing the personal information of a federal agent, following allegations they livestreamed the pursuit of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent to his home. Cynthia Raygoza, Ashleigh Brown, and Sandra Carmona Samane are accused of tracking the agent from downtown Los Angeles to his residence, broadcasting the chase on Instagram, and then sharing his address online. Prosecutors contend the women shouted "la migra lives here" and "ICE lives on your street" to neighbors, urging viewers to disseminate the information. This indictment underscores the U.S. Attorney's Office's firm stance against threatening or doxxing law enforcement, especially amidst a reported surge in attacks on ICE agents.</p>

The claim alleges severe civil and constitutional rights violations, including excessive force and indifference to a serious medical condition, during a September 9 immigration raid at his Van Nuys business. Surveillance footage reportedly shows agents body-slamming Shouhed as he tried to communicate that his employees had legal work documentation. His attorney states that agents ignored Shouhed's recent heart surgery and denied him medical attention after he sustained injuries, including multiple broken ribs and elbow trauma. The incident raises significant questions about the conduct and accountability of federal immigration agents during operations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump publicly declared his expectation of further criminal charges against individuals he views as political adversaries, immediately following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. These blunt remarks intensify concerns regarding the politicization of the Justice Department, especially given the perceived fragility of the case against Comey and the contentious appointment of Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump personal lawyer, as the new US attorney overseeing the prosecution. Trump has recently fixated on initiating criminal investigations into figures such as New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. This ongoing pattern suggests a concerted campaign of political retribution, raising profound questions about the impartiality and independence of federal law enforcement and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Magistrate Judge, Lindsey Vaala, expressed confusion and surprise regarding the handling of former FBI Director James Comey's indictment, according to a transcript of the proceedings. The judge questioned the newly appointed interim U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump personal lawyer, about the existence of two inconsistent versions of the indictment, one of which Halligan claimed not to have seen. The grand jury ultimately declined one of the three proposed counts, with a narrow vote on the other two. These procedural irregularities, combined with the late timing of the session and the memo from career prosecutors advising against charges, raise serious questions about the integrity of the process.</p>

Miguel Angel García-Hernandez of Mexico and Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela were injured, while Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador was tragically killed. The alleged shooter, Joshua Jahn, 29, of Fairview, Texas, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, having left notes indicating his intention to target ICE employees rather than the detainees. García-Hernandez, an undocumented house painter and primary family provider, is in critical condition, leading his family to launch a GoFundMe campaign for support.

ICE reported that he was found in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash, and a fixed blade hunting knife, and initially attempted to flee from police in a school district vehicle. School officials have expressed their shock and concern, emphasizing Roberts' significant contributions to the school community and his notable past as an Olympic athlete for Guyana.

The pharmaceutical tariff includes an exemption for companies establishing manufacturing plants in the U.S. While experts suggest the pharma tariffs might have a modest impact due to generic exemptions and existing U.S. production, the move could significantly increase healthcare and housing costs. Despite Trump's claims of "unbelievable success" and no inflation, recent economic data indicates these duties are now driving prices upward, with manufacturing and construction jobs also seeing declines since previous tariff implementations.

          <p>President Trump has issued a directive to his administration to declassify all federal records concerning Amelia Earhart, whose mysterious 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has fueled public fascination for nearly 90 years. Trump highlighted the enduring enigma and various theories surrounding her fate, including unsubstantiated claims of her capture by the Japanese, as reasons for the declassification. While the widely accepted explanation is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed near Howland Island, some lawmakers and researchers persist in seeking greater transparency from the government. However, previous FBI reviews of Navy files on Earhart concluded there was no evidence to support theories of a spy mission or capture, deeming such information not prejudicial to national defense.</p>

          <p>Southern California has recently witnessed an impressive display of nature, with thousands of lightning strikes illuminating the skies over the past two days. At least 2,000 strikes were recorded across the region, extending from the Channel Islands to the Central Coast, with the majority of thunderstorm activity occurring approximately 50 miles offshore. This phenomenon is linked to a low-pressure system that has retained significant moisture. Furthermore, the Bay Area experienced over 13,000 lightning strikes, predominantly in-cloud, with minimal associated fire risk due to prevailing wet conditions. Forecasters anticipate a weak low-pressure system will continue to move through Southern California this weekend, bringing additional thunderstorms, winds, and isolated showers, particularly to interior valleys and mountains. Cooler temperatures are also expected across the West Coast early next week.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to address hundreds of senior U.S. generals and admirals in an unprecedented gathering at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, next week. Hegseth intends to articulate his vision for revitalizing the "warrior ethos" within the U.S. military and introduce new standards aimed at achieving this goal. Only officers holding command positions, accompanied by their senior enlisted advisers, have been summoned for this event, which is anticipated to be concise. This highly unusual meeting, where Hegseth will personally deliver his message, prompts inquiries regarding enhanced security requirements, substantial travel and lodging expenses, and its potential connection to his earlier announcement concerning a 20% reduction in the number of four-star officer ranks.</p>

          <p>Team Europe achieved a commanding start on day one of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, taking a 5½-2½ lead over the USA. This strong performance, winning the morning foursomes 3-1 and afternoon fourballs 2½-1½, positions Europe favorably for their first away win since 2012. History indicates that teams leading after the second session often win the trophy. Captain Luke Donald expressed satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of the fast start while noting the need to secure 14½ points. Despite a defiant US captain Keegan Bradley, Europe's dominance, particularly from Jon Rahm, has dampened the home crowd's enthusiasm and sets a challenging tone for the remaining days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert's assertion of a "true car market crash" is examined, with claims of dealerships being desperate due to overfilled lots and cars remaining unsold for an average of 120 days. Data from Black Book partially supports this, indicating longer selling times for premier brands and overall sales figures below 2017-19 levels. However, the article provides a fact-check, highlighting that while some manufacturers are offering 0-2% finance deals, these are predominantly for electric vehicles, and general interest rates are closer to 4-6%, not matching pre-pandemic lows. The analysis concludes that while the car market is indeed experiencing a slowdown, the evidence does not fully substantiate a comprehensive "crash," suggesting that various complex factors, such as a deceleration in EV sales, are influencing current trends.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on two federal charges: one count of making false statements to Congress and another of obstruction of justice. These charges originate from his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020, where he allegedly lied about authorizing another individual at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports concerning an investigation related to "PERSON 1," widely understood to be Hillary Clinton. Comey has vehemently asserted his innocence, expressing strong confidence in the federal judicial system. This indictment follows President Trump's persistent public calls for Comey's prosecution and the controversial appointment of Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer, as the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, raising significant questions about political influence in the justice system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly demanded the immediate firing of Lisa Monaco, Microsoft's president of global affairs and a former Deputy Attorney General in the Biden administration. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, asserted that Monaco poses a "menace to U.S. National Security," particularly given Microsoft's substantial contracts with the federal government. He further claimed that Monaco had been stripped of all security clearances, lost access to national security intelligence, and was banned from federal properties due to her "many wrongful acts." Microsoft has declined to comment on the president's demand. This public call follows Monaco's appointment in July and Microsoft's recent decision to halt cloud services to a unit of the Israeli military, underscoring Trump's continued targeting of former officials and the political pressures on major corporations.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ideological split, has cleared the way for the Trump administration to continue withholding more than $4 billion in foreign aid that had been approved by Congress. This ruling reverses a federal judge's earlier order for the administration to release the funds, with the conservative justices arguing that the President's foreign policy authority outweighs the harms asserted by the international aid organizations that brought the lawsuit. Justice Elena Kagan, in her dissent, strongly criticized the decision-making process, highlighting its expedited nature through the emergency docket, which allowed for "scant briefing, no oral argument, and no opportunity to deliberate in conference." This action, involving a rare "pocket rescission" not used since the 1970s, raises significant questions about executive power and the balance of congressional oversight regarding appropriated funds.</p>

He questioned the Federal Reserve's capacity to manage these divergent trends effectively. Throughout the week, he plans to closely observe quarterly reports from Carnival and Jefferies for insights into the cruise industry and investment banking sectors. Paychex is identified as a vital metric for assessing the overall health of the economy, while Nike's earnings report is eagerly awaited for signs of a potential breakout under its new CEO. The week culminates with the release of the critical nonfarm payrolls report, which holds considerable sway over the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's sustained attacks on James Comey and the controversial leadership changes within the U.S. Attorney's Office could severely undermine the case against the former FBI director. Comey's defense is expected to argue selective or vindictive prosecution, citing Trump's public animosity and the appointment of his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, to oversee the indictment despite career prosecutors advising against charges. Such claims are difficult to win, but the unique circumstances, including Trump's public comments and the procedural irregularities, provide strong factual evidence.

This complaint emerged two years after a San Francisco Chronicle investigation revealed accusations of inexperienced employees, inadequate staff training, and understaffing at Bay Area facilities, with former employees corroborating claims of neglected pets. Wag Hotels maintains that the settlement addresses "isolated incidents" without admitting wrongdoing, reaffirming its dedication to providing exceptional pet care.

          <p>Palestinians are pressing the UK government to formally respond to a comprehensive 400-page legal petition demanding an official apology and reparations for alleged colonial-era war crimes committed during the British Mandate in historical Palestine from 1917 to 1948. This renewed call for accountability comes in the wake of Britain's recent recognition of a Palestinian state. The petitioners, representing 13 families, detail alleged abuses including murder, torture, expulsion, and collective punishment, which a 2022 BBC review supported with evidence of arbitrary killings and the use of human shields. While acknowledging the significance of state recognition, the petitioners contend that it falls short of addressing the profound historical conduct and enduring legacy of British actions. This case seeks to build upon previous UK concessions for colonial-era abuses, underscoring persistent demands for historical justice.</p>
