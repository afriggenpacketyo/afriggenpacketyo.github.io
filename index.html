          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction effectively ordering the shutdown of a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling sides with environmental groups and a Native American Tribe, who argued that the Trump administration violated federal law by bypassing necessary environmental reviews. Citing risks of irreparable harm to the Everglades ecosystem, the judge has prohibited the transfer of new detainees and ordered the removal of temporary structures within 60 days. This decision represents a significant legal challenge to the administration's policies using environmental protection laws.</p>

          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, 36 years after he and his brother murdered their parents. The decision came after a nearly 10-hour hearing where commissioners cited factors such as his possession of illegal cellphones in prison and a perceived lack of empathy in the killing of his mother. Menendez, who argued he acted in a state of terror after years of abuse, will be eligible for another hearing in three years. This was his first parole eligibility hearing after a judge resentenced both brothers to 50-years-to-life under a youth offender law.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, where markets expect signals about a potential September interest rate cut. Amid significant political pressure from the Trump administration, Powell's address is also expected to cover the Fed's long-term policy framework and its stance on inflation versus employment. Analysts will be closely watching his characterization of the labor market and the economic impact of tariffs, as the speech is seen as a critical moment for determining the central bank's near-term policy trajectory.

          <p>Meta has shut down a large Italian Facebook group named "Mia Moglie" (My Wife) where men were sharing non-consensual, intimate images of women, often without their knowledge. The group, which had amassed around 32,000 members, featured explicit photos accompanied by degrading and violent comments, prompting widespread outrage. Italian authorities have received over a thousand reports about the group, which Meta confirmed was removed for violating its policies against sexual exploitation. The incident has sparked a broader conversation in Italy about online misogyny and virtual violence against women.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has confirmed that its human resources chief, Julia Villagra, is leaving the company, marking another high-profile departure for the artificial intelligence startup. Villagra was promoted to the role of chief people officer in March and her exit comes as OpenAI faces intense competition for talent from rivals like Google and Meta. The departure follows the recent hiring of former Meta executive Fidji Simo, who has taken on a more active role in the company's consumer and product initiatives. OpenAI is currently navigating aggressive hiring tactics in the industry while also restructuring into a public benefit corporation.</p>

The "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also excludes energy, remained steady at 3.4%.

          <p>A lawyer for the online message board 4chan has stated the company will not pay a proposed £20,000 daily fine from Ofcom, the UK's media regulator. The fine was provisionally issued for failing to comply with information requests as part of an investigation under the new Online Safety Act. The law firm representing 4chan argues that as a U.S.-based company, it is protected by the First Amendment and that Ofcom's actions constitute an "illegal campaign of harassment." This defiance sets up a significant international clash over the extraterritorial reach of the UK's stringent new internet regulations.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new guidance for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to stop marketing snacks for infants under one year old. The guidelines also aim to restrict health claims that are not supported by scientific evidence. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month deadline to make their products healthier, after which the government may consider further action if there is a lack of voluntary compliance.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Washington D.C. to promote his administration's anti-crime initiative, which has involved a surge of federal officers and National Guard troops in the city. During his remarks, Trump declared the federal takeover of the local police a success and made a lengthy, unrelated promise to re-grass the city's parks to resemble his own golf courses. The event was framed as a show of support for law enforcement amid the administration's crackdown, which local officials have criticized as unnecessary and an overreach of federal power.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he called an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retail giant raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust topline growth and margin expansion even while absorbing the impact of tariffs. Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a rare earnings miss driven by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues. He argued that Walmart's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices positions it for continued success, making the market's negative reaction illogical. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying, with China and Russia currently leading the field. These weapons are difficult to detect and intercept, potentially altering the dynamics of modern warfare. While the U.S. and UK are now investing heavily to catch up, their focus on counter-insurgency over the past two decades allowed rivals to advance their programs. Experts note that while the technology is formidable, defensive measures are also being developed to counter the threat posed by these next-generation weapons.</p>

          <p>American midfielder Dante Polvara became the hero for Aberdeen in their Europa League play-off, coming off the bench to score a crucial goal and spark a 2-2 comeback draw against FCSB. Despite being used sparingly by manager Jimmy Thelin this season, Polvara's energetic and skillful 30-minute cameo has intensified calls from fans for him to be given a starting role. The performance, which included a brilliant swiveling goal and creating several chances, highlighted his value to the team. This puts pressure on the manager to consider changing his lineup for the critical second leg in Bucharest next week.</p>

The incident, known as swatting, is being investigated by local and federal authorities, including the FBI.

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its campaign against the Federal Reserve, now demanding the removal of Governor Lisa Cook over unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. After Cook stated she would not be bullied into resigning, a top administration official sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to remove her from the board. This represents an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence, as the Fed chair does not have the authority to fire another governor. The pressure campaign is part of a broader war waged by the president against the Fed's policies and personnel. (not investment advice)</p>
