The article contrasts PSG's current success and team-oriented culture under coach Luis Enrique with their struggles just seven months prior. Both managers emphasize a philosophy of intense, principle-driven football that is also enjoyable for players and fans, highlighting a significant cultural shift at PSG from individual stars to a cohesive, hard-working team. This new identity has positioned them as favorites for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, left seven people unaccounted for, and positive identification of the remains is pending. Investigations revealed the facility, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, was operating without the necessary local licenses for storing fireworks.

          <p>Major LA Galaxy supporter groups, including the Angel City Brigade, staged a protest during a July 4th match to voice their frustration with the team's silence regarding recent ICE raids affecting the local Latino community. The fans displayed banners with messages like "Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants" and walked out of the stadium at the 12th minute as a sign of protest. Organizers expressed deep disappointment that the club, which heavily markets to the Latino community, has not issued a public statement of support, unlike other Los Angeles sports teams. They also organized a fundraiser for pro-immigrant organizations.</p>

          <p>Despite attracting over a million people, Pride in London and other similar events across the UK are facing a precarious future due to significant drops in corporate sponsorship and volunteer numbers. According to the UK Pride Organisers Network, over 85 Pride organizations have reported reduced funding, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or charge for previously free events. Organizers attribute the decline partly to a shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives by global corporations, alongside rising operational costs for safety and security. Despite these challenges, organizers remain resilient and committed to the movement's continuation.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover 'Genetic Switch' for Organ Regeneration in Mice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 01:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have successfully restored damaged outer ear tissue in mice by activating a "genetic switch" that was previously disabled through evolution. The study, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue repair. By reactivating this pathway, the scientists achieved complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage, offering hope that a similar mechanism could exist in other organs. While human application remains a distant goal, the findings provide a significant proof-of-concept for future research in regenerative medicine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes the media and political firestorm surrounding the punk band Bob Vylan, who led a "Death to the IDF" chant at Glastonbury, which was misreported by some outlets as "Death to Israelis." It argues that this controversy serves as a diversion from the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the death toll continues to rise amidst an Israeli military assault. The piece contends that while there are valid criticisms of the band's rhetoric, the disproportionate focus on this incident, compared to the lack of front-page coverage of mass casualty events in Gaza, reflects a deliberate manipulation of the discourse. This strategy, it suggests, is increasingly ineffective as public awareness and sympathy for Palestinians grow.</p>

The game was marked by poor pitching from the Dodgers, including a disastrous sixth inning where reliever Noah Davis allowed ten runs.

Critics accuse the government of honoring the ROC's victory over Japan while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. The Kuomintang (KMT) government, which retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, continued using the ROC title. However, Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) emphasizes a distinct Taiwanese identity, creating a dilemma in how to commemorate a history that is intrinsically linked to mainland China.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that to understand Donald Trump's style of governance, one should look beyond Eurocentric analogies and consider parallels with cold war-era dictators in Africa. The author points to tactics like renaming landmarks, using military force against domestic protesters, and embracing theatrical but damaging economic policies as reminiscent of leaders like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The piece suggests that the U.S., having supported such autocratic regimes during the cold war, is now seeing some of those same political behaviors manifest domestically. It concludes that while this comparison is alarming, the history of these dictatorships also shows the resilience of civil society against tyranny.</p>

If owners cannot pay the fees quickly, they lose their vehicles, which the tow companies can then legally sell.

          <h2>President Trump Signs Sweeping Tax and Spending Bill into Law on Independence Day</h2>

          <p>On the Fourth of July, President Donald Trump signed his signature "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" into law, enacting a sweeping package of policy changes. The legislation makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent, boosts defense and border security funding, and simultaneously introduces major cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid and food assistance. While the White House touts the bill as a win for the country, Democrats have decried it, warning it will benefit the wealthy, increase the national debt by a projected $3 trillion, and potentially cause millions to lose health insurance.

          <h2>Fact-Check: Trump's New Bill Does Not Eliminate Taxes on Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 20:17:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims from the Social Security Administration, President Trump's newly signed "big, beautiful bill" does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Policy experts clarify that the legislation introduces a new temporary tax deduction for seniors, which can lower their overall taxable income, but it does not change the fundamental way benefits are taxed. The deduction primarily benefits higher-income seniors and offers no advantage to low-income individuals who already pay no federal income tax. Critics also warn the measure could worsen Social Security's long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Ruling Allows Trump Administration to Deport Migrants to South Sudan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 20:12:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records to South Sudan, a country where they claim they could face torture or death. The court's order clarified that a lower court judge could not block the removal, effectively ending a weeks-long legal battle that saw the men detained at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti. The dissent, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, expressed grave concern that the ruling allows the government to send the individuals to a dangerous situation. Following the decision, a lower court denied a final request to halt the deportation.</p>

          <h2>A Detailed Look at the Contents of President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:59:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly enacted "big, beautiful bill" contains a wide array of significant policy changes, passed by Congress along party lines. Key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap temporarily, and allocating over $46 billion for border wall construction. The bill is funded in part by imposing new restrictions and work requirements on Medicaid and the SNAP food stamp program, which the CBO estimates will cause millions to lose benefits. It also terminates many green energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act while raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>
