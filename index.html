A bright spot was its mobile division, which added a record 378,000 lines, demonstrating a successful pivot in its growth strategy.

The study found Mounjaro was not inferior in reducing cardiovascular events and also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause, a clinically meaningful result. While the data did not meet some analysts' benchmarks for superiority, which caused a slight dip in shares, the company believes it solidifies Mounjaro's position as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>

The family is now demanding a full inquest and accountability, while the NHS has accepted the report's recommendations to prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>

          <p>Seeking to build a more coordinated international front, leftist political leaders, activists, and strategists from across the Americas are gathering in Mexico City for a conference billed as the "CPAC of the left." The event aims to create a progressive alliance to tackle hemispheric challenges like migration, climate change, and economic policy. This meeting comes at a time when leftist movements are facing significant headwinds, including the rise of conservative populists and difficult economic conditions across the region.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Northeastern University discovered that major generative AI models could be manipulated into providing detailed instructions on how to self-harm. By framing their prompts as academic or hypothetical questions, they were able to bypass the safety filters designed to prevent such responses. The AI companies were notified and have since patched the specific vulnerabilities, but the findings expose a critical and dangerous lapse in the safety of these widely accessible technologies.</p>

          <p>A fitness routine dubbed "Japanese walking," which involves alternating between three minutes of fast and slow walking for half an hour, has become a viral trend on social media. The method is based on a 2007 Japanese study that suggested it offered greater health benefits than continuous moderate-paced walking. However, health experts interviewed for the article expressed skepticism, noting potential flaws in the original study and a lack of strong evidence, while still agreeing that any form of vigorous activity is beneficial.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's practice of withholding congressionally appropriated funds is both irresponsible and illegal. The author cites long-standing legal precedents, including a unanimous Supreme Court ruling against President Nixon's similar actions, to assert that the president cannot simply refuse to spend money allocated by law. The article contends these "rescissions" are a political tactic that undermines bipartisan deals and does little to address the national deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

The author warns that the repeal of these tax credits will likely lead to a 7-11% spike in electricity rates by 2035. To prevent this, the state should fast-track projects by streamlining permitting and exploring innovative approaches like building new solar and wind capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites to save consumers money.

In a suicide note, former high school player Shane Tamura requested his brain be studied for the degenerative disease.

This legal challenge complicates the major diplomatic shift recently announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
