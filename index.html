          <p>President Donald Trump expressed his frustration with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's interest rate policy following a disappointing ADP jobs report. Trump urged Powell to lower interest rates, claiming that Europe has already reduced rates nine times. The ADP report revealed that private payrolls increased by only 37,000 in May, significantly lower than the expected 110,000, marking the lowest monthly reading since March 2023. Trump has repeatedly pressured Powell to cut borrowing rates to stimulate economic growth and has even hinted at potentially firing him, despite Powell's insistence that monetary policy should be guided by economic data, not politics.

          <p>Two Chinese scientists have been charged with conspiracy and smuggling after allegedly attempting to bring a plant disease-causing fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the United States. The FBI arrested Jian Yunqing, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, while her partner, Liu Zunyong, a researcher at Zhejiang University, was turned away at the Detroit airport. The FBI claims the fungus could be used as an agricultural weapon, posing a threat to public safety.

While national average CD rates vary by term, online banks often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates.

          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, *And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America*, makes a compelling argument for recognizing housing as a human right to address the homelessness crisis in the United States. The book examines the origins of the crisis, how it has been perpetuated through inadequate responses, and potential solutions, incorporating personal stories and legal insights. Foscarinis challenges the narrative that homelessness is a personal failure, arguing instead that it is a policy failure stemming from systemic inequality and inadequate support. The book advocates for the "Housing First" model, prioritizing stable housing as the initial intervention, and emphasizes the need for political will to implement effective solutions and enshrine housing as a fundamental human right.</p>

The decision to means-test the payment was initially one of the first major policies after Labour's election victory, but the government is now working on a revised system to provide clarity and support to more pensioners.

          <h2>Nvidia CEO's Fear of Failure Fuels Success, Biographer Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 09:05:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to his biographer, Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is significantly motivated by negative emotions, particularly a fear of failure, paranoia about competition, and guilt about letting people down. Despite leading a company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, Huang's anxiety drives him to work harder and achieve more. Witt's interviews with Huang and his colleagues revealed that Huang becomes uncomfortable when things are going well, constantly pushing himself to avoid complacency. This unique perspective challenges the typical image of successful CEOs as upbeat and optimistic, highlighting the role of negative emotions in driving innovation and success.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing voices due to her votes on the Supreme Court, particularly her decisions to side with liberal justices on certain cases. This criticism includes her vote against President Trump's effort to rescind foreign aid and her rejection of his request to delay sentencing in the New York hush money case. Despite Trump's public support for Barrett, some allies accuse her of being a "DEI Hire" and express disappointment in her judicial performance. While Barrett has delivered conservative votes on key issues, the rumblings highlight divisions within the conservative movement regarding judicial appointments and expectations.</p>

          <p>The gas industry, including SoCalGas, is actively opposing a California clean air rule that aims to reduce emissions from gas appliances, arguing that the rule would increase costs for consumers. The proposed rules would set targets for sales of new zero-emission space and water heaters, designed to improve air quality and reduce planet-heating emissions. Critics argue that the industry is prioritizing profits over public health and environmental sustainability. The opposition campaign has led to weakened rules and delayed implementation, sparking concerns about the industry's influence on environmental regulations and its impact on communities affected by climate change.</p>
