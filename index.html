Foshan, a major manufacturing hub, has reported the majority of the region's cases, which have now surpassed 6,500. Officials are being directed to strengthen port quarantines, improve control measures, and eliminate mosquitoes to cut off the channels of transmission.

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has commented on the transfer situation involving star striker Alexander Isak, calling it "complex" and "far from ideal." The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old Swedish international, whom they value at around £150 million. Isak is currently training alone at his former club, Real Sociedad, a development Howe learned about through the media, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the player's future with Newcastle ahead of the new Premier League season.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the agency reported weaker-than-expected job growth for July. The president claimed without evidence that the figures were "rigged," a move that drew sharp criticism for politicizing economic data and undermining public trust. The dismissal, combined with ongoing concerns about the economic impact of his tariff policies, contributed to a significant drop in US stock markets as critics warned of damage to the integrity of government statistics.

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose steep new import tariffs on numerous countries, including Canada, India, Switzerland, and the EU, has sent shockwaves through the global economy. The announcement caused US, European, and Asian stock markets to fall sharply, compounded by a weaker-than-expected US jobs report. While some nations like South Africa and India are scrambling to negotiate exemptions before the August 7 effective date, industries such as French wine are bracing for a significant negative impact from the new duties.

Published in the journal Cell, the research indicates that about nine million years ago, an ancestor of the modern tomato cross-bred with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This pivotal moment was a key driver in the development of the tuber, the edible part that has made the potato the third most consumed food crop globally.
