          <p>A goods train from China arrived in Tehran via a new rail corridor, reducing delivery times significantly. This ambitious project, traversing several Central Asian countries, aims to connect China with Europe and Africa, enhancing Iran's economic resilience by diversifying trade routes and reducing reliance on maritime channels. The launch coincides with heightened US-Iran tensions, including potential interception of Iranian oil tankers, raising concerns in the US and Israel about Iran's ability to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear ambitions. This overland route enables Iran to continue exporting oil and minerals to China and other markets, solidifying its position as a central transit hub. The new railway is poised to integrate into land and sea networks, connecting China and Central Asia with Europe via Turkey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rental prices in major German cities have nearly doubled in the past decade, despite existing rent control laws. Berlin experienced the most significant rise in new rental prices, followed by Leipzig and Bremen. Munich remains the most expensive city for renters, with prices reaching nearly â‚¬22 per square meter. Germany has laws to limit rents in regions with tight housing markets, but landlords are not subject to government supervision, requiring tenants to report suspected violations. This data highlights the ineffectiveness of current rent control measures in curbing rising rental costs in Germany.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested more than 80 illegal migrants, some with criminal records, at a Louisiana racetrack during a worksite enforcement operation. The joint operation, conducted with other federal law enforcement agencies, followed the lifting of a brief pause on immigration arrests at certain businesses. Authorities acted on intelligence that businesses at Delta Downs Racetrack were employing unauthorized workers. ICE is reviewing the cases to identify other criminal activities, such as document fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking, in addition to labor exploitation and immigration violations.</p>

Despite sovereignty considerations, programs developed in the US will likely have significant European content, and vice versa, due to the nature of the supply chain.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to lower duty payments by strategically altering product classifications. This involves modifying an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code. Despite broad-based tariffs, exemptions for certain products allow companies to benefit through these strategic design choices. Tariff engineering is considered a legal practice, allowing companies to reduce duty liability by leveraging the over 5,000 product classification codes used by U.S. customs authorities.

Economists speculate that businesses are passing on recent increases in employer National Insurance payments to customers.

          <p>The man charged with killing a prominent Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another could face the death penalty, something that is a rarity for Minnesota but could become more common under the Trump administration. Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, and the state's last execution was a botched hanging in 1906. But federal prosecutors announced charges against Vance Boelter on Monday that can carry the death penalty. Two of the six federal counts can carry the death penalty, something federal prosecutors have not sought in a Minnesota-based case since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.</p>

          <p>North Korea plans to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to support reconstruction work in Russia's Kursk region, according to a top Russian official. This is the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the two nations. North Korea has already supplied thousands of combat troops and conventional weapons to support Russia's war against Ukraine. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu said that Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers to clear mines and 5,000 military construction workers to restore infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Migrants in Southern California are living in fear due to increased ICE raids, following through on campaign promises. ICE operations have become more aggressive, targeting different cities without respite for the undocumented community. The raids began after Trump's inauguration, with an internal government memo revealing plans for mass raids in Los Angeles. One raid occurred at a Home Depot parking lot where migrants seek day labor, leading to the arrest of around 25 people, and the federal agency commented that it would arrest foreigners who violate immigration laws.</p>

          <p>China completed the inaugural test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a critical zero-altitude escape trial. The spacecraft, developed for Chinaâ€™s 2030 lunar ambitions, has two variants: one for space station operations and another for lunar missions. During the test, the spacecraft's escape engines ignited while grounded, and the return capsule reached its designated altitude before separating and landing using an airbag system. This safety test simulates emergencies during launch, ensuring astronauts can be rapidly extracted from danger zones.</p>

The company aims to achieve suborbital space flight in 2029, utilizing Honda technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems. Honda said it has made no decisions regarding the commercialization of this technology but that it has "the potential to contribute more to people's daily lives by launching satellites with its own rockets, that could lead to various services that are also compatible with other Honda business." The company believes growing expectations for a "data system in outer space" will likely increase the demand for satellite launch rockets in coming years.</p>

Their momentum was halted when River doubled the lead three minutes into the second half with Norwegian defender Hoibraten's attempted pass to keeper Shusaku Nishikawa with a back header falling short, allowing Driussi to sneak in and nod home.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to appear before Congress for hearings addressing various issues, including the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. Lawmakers are expected to question him on the administration's response to the crisis, as well as other controversial policies such as the ban on transgender troops and the shifting of funds from troop housing to border security. Hegseth's past use of unsecured messaging apps to share sensitive military plans is also likely to be scrutinized. The hearings come as the U.S. has repositioned military assets in the region to respond to potential threats.</p>
