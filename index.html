          <p>Bukayo Saka, Arsenal's winger, was notably absent from England's squad set to face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, raising concerns about his fitness. Head coach Thomas Tuchel disclosed that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting a link between his omission and his physical condition. Saka, who is 23, has yet to play under Tuchel due to a prior injury that kept him out of the German coach's first camp. It remains uncertain whether Saka will participate in the friendly against Senegal on June 10, as he aims to add to his 43 caps for the Three Lions. The team is currently unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, with victories against Latvia and Albania. The optimism score is not mentioned in the article.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is finding it difficult to reduce the amount of foreign aid allocated to cover hotel bills for asylum seekers in the country. New figures indicate that the Home Office plans to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, which is only slightly less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. This money primarily covers the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK. While the Home Office states its commitment to ending asylum hotels and speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money, critics argue that the current system diverts funds from vital humanitarian and development programs.

          <p>King Charles is reportedly upset over the potential cancellation of the royal family's cherished Christmas tradition of pheasant shooting at Sandringham Estate due to a shortage of birds. Royal experts suggest this reflects his personal attachment to the tradition and commitment to royal heritage, compounded by concerns about the management of Sandringham. The shortage is attributed to the king's preference for maintaining the estate's game population without importing birds. Some suggest the change could prompt a review of the tradition, while others hope it could provide an opportunity for reconciliation with Prince Harry.

          <p>Tehran has denounced the US travel ban on Iranians and citizens of 11 other mostly Middle Eastern and African countries, calling Washington’s decision a sign of a “racist mentality”. Donald Trump signed an executive order reviving sweeping restrictions justified on national security grounds. Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the foreign ministry’s director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, said the measure indicates the deep hostility of American decision-makers towards the Iranian and Muslim people. The US ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
