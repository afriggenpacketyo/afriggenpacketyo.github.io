          <h2>Appeals Court Sides with Trump on Federalizing California National Guard</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 10:46:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that President Trump likely acted within his authority when federalizing the California National Guard amid immigration raid protests. The court blocked a lower court order that would have returned control to Governor Newsom. The judges cited violence during the protests, including attacks on federal officers and damage to federal buildings, as justification for Trump's action. The court determined that the president did not need the governor's consent to federalize the guard, allowing Trump to retain control as the case proceeds through the courts. Optimism remains low given the political polarization and legal battles surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>A training camp for the Senegalese women's basketball team in the US was cancelled after the US denied visas to five players and seven officials. Senegal's Prime Minister Sonko instructed the Ministry of Sports to cancel the ten-day preparatory training initially planned in the United States. The team was scheduled to train in the US in preparation for the 2025 Women's AfroBasket tournament in Ivory Coast next month. The US State Department declined to comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality under US law, and the situation raises concerns about potential travel restrictions on African countries, impacting international collaborations and sports events.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales after a final debate on the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. The bill was backed by 314 votes to 291, marking a majority of 23, and MPs were given a free vote on the issue. The bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, proposes allowing terminally ill people over 18 to end their life under specific conditions, including a life expectancy of fewer than six months and approval from two independent doctors. The bill now proceeds to the House of Lords for further scrutiny as the debate on end-of-life choices continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by linguists at the University of Queensland analyzed nearly two billion words from online sources across 20 English-speaking regions and determined that Americans swear more frequently online than other English-speaking groups. The research, which excluded social media, found that Americans use curse words 0.036% of the time, compared to the British at 0.025%. Researchers suggest that the anonymity of the internet may contribute to Americans' more forgiving attitude toward online vulgarity. The study underscores cultural differences in acceptable language use and provides insights into human behavior and communication styles in online environments.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles. The court sided with oil and gas companies and Republican-led states, arguing that California's waiver to set tougher standards caused financial harm. The ruling overturns a lower court's decision, with Justice Kavanaugh writing that the government cannot target businesses through stringent regulations and then evade lawsuits. Environmentalists argue that California's waiver is essential for cutting greenhouse gases and promoting vehicle innovation, underscoring the ongoing battle over environmental regulations and states' rights.</p>

The incident occurred shortly after Young defended Memphis against claims made by sports analyst Stephen A. Smith regarding safety concerns for NBA players in the city.

          <p>A heatwave across the UK is set to intensify, bringing temperatures up to 34C and a yellow warning for thunderstorms in parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The Met Office expects torrential downpours, localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning from Saturday afternoon into Sunday. An amber heat-health alert is in effect, warning of significant pressures on health and social care services, and some areas are at risk of "tropical nights" with temperatures not dropping below 20C. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and scientists link climate change to the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves.</p>

          <p>A study published in Jama Pediatrics indicates that stricter state gun control measures are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children. States that enacted stricter gun control measures after the 2010 McDonald v Chicago ruling saw a decrease in pediatric firearm deaths, while more permissive states experienced an increase. The study highlights the impact of common-sense gun policies on child safety, such as background checks, permitting, and safe-storage requirements. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to prioritize measures that protect children and reduce gun violence, advocating for universal background checks and safe-storage regulations.</p>

          <p>Despite a heated debate over whether a return of Donald Trump to office would push Europe and China closer together, the EU appears to have settled on a firm "no." Initial openness to deeper trade ties with Beijing has waned due to China's failure to address EU trade grievances. Impatience with China's lack of progress in delivering on its charm offensive has surfaced publicly, leaving Brussels disillusioned.

          <p>Invasive insects, such as the Asian tiger mosquito and the Asian hornet, are becoming more common across Europe due to climate change and global trade. These species threaten native plants and animals, contributing to biodiversity loss, and also pose risks to human health and agriculture. The Asian hornet, for example, preys on European honeybees, which are crucial for crop pollination, and controlling these invasive species costs the EU billions annually. Measures to mitigate the damage include traps, nest removal, and preventing the insects from spreading through trade and transportation.</p>
