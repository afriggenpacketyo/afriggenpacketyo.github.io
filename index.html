          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a substantial $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, arguing it will incentivize companies to hire American workers instead of foreign labor. Economists offer mixed predictions, suggesting potential short-term gains for domestic tech workers but also warning of long-term risks to economic growth and innovation. The policy is contentious, with proponents claiming it protects Americans from cheaper foreign labor, while critics argue that skilled immigrant workers often create more jobs and boost company performance. The debate highlights differing views on the role of immigration in the U.S. economy and the effectiveness of such protectionist measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to Rolex questioning the company's decision to host President Donald Trump at the U.S. Open, suggesting it may be an attempt to gain favor and avoid new tariffs on Swiss exports. The letter draws parallels to actions by Apple and Nvidia, which made domestic investment announcements after engaging with the administration. Warren expressed concern that the invitation could be an effort to secure special-interest exemptions from a 39% levy on Swiss products. The White House dismissed these claims as "asinine conspiracy theories," highlighting the ongoing tensions between the administration and corporate interactions.</p>

          <p>A drone attack originating from Yemen struck the southern Israeli town of Eilat, resulting in injuries to twenty individuals, two of whom are in serious condition. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the strike on the Red Sea coast town and noted that attempts were made to intercept the unmanned aerial vehicle. While the Yemeni Houthi group has not officially claimed responsibility, the incident is being described as one of its most serious attacks in terms of casualties. In response, the IDF has evacuated the area and urged residents to remain in protected zones following alerts.</p>

          <p>Music superstar Mariah Carey is releasing her sixteenth studio album, "Here for It All," after a seven-year hiatus, a project deeply influenced by personal grief and healing. The album was created while she was mourning the deaths of her mother, Patricia Carey, and her estranged sister, Alison, who passed away on the same day last year. Carey describes the album's sound as both new and classic, reflecting her journey of processing these profound losses and finding creative renewal. She also collaborated with artist Anderson .Paak on several tracks, including the upcoming single "Play This Song."</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, two House Republicans are introducing legislation to memorialize him on U.S. currency. Representatives August Pfluger and Abe Hamadeh have proposed a bill directing the U.S. Treasury to mint 400,000 silver dollar coins featuring Kirk's likeness. This is the latest among several initiatives by GOP lawmakers to honor Kirk, which also include proposals for congressional medals and a statue at the U.S. Capitol. If passed, Kirk, at age 31, would be the youngest American to be featured on U.S. currency, an honor his supporters feel befits his significant impact.</p>

          <p>A targeted shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas resulted in one detainee being killed and two others wounded, with the gunman later dying from a self-inflicted wound. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, noting that messages found on recovered bullet casings were anti-ICE in nature. This attack follows a recent bomb threat at the same facility in August and is part of a broader pattern of increased threats and violence against federal facilities in Texas. The events underscore rising tensions surrounding immigration enforcement under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in 2023 as New York City's first-ever director of rodent mitigation, has resigned from her post. Known as the "rat czar," Corradi was tasked with tackling the city's persistent rodent problem, overseeing a $3.5 million budget aimed at public awareness and mitigation strategies, including rat birth control. During her tenure, there was a noticeable decrease in rat-related complaints to the city's 311 service line. Mayor Adams praised her creative approach to the complex task and affirmed that the city's efforts to combat its estimated 3 million rats will continue unabated as Corradi transitions to a different role within the city government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has implemented a ban preventing Iranian officials attending the UN summit in New York from engaging in certain shopping activities. Described by the State Department as a measure of "maximum pressure," the restrictions prohibit access to wholesale club stores like Costco and require officials to seek permission for purchasing "luxury goods." The list of restricted items includes vehicles worth over $60,000 and other goods valued at more than $1,000, such as watches and electronics. This move aims to prevent what a spokesperson called a "shopping spree" for clerical elites while the Iranian populace faces economic hardship under U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck, Ford Motor is offering special financing rates to consumers with lower, subprime credit scores. The promotion provides these buyers with lower interest rates typically reserved for those with higher credit ratings, making the vehicles more affordable for a wider range of customers. While such programs can help reduce inventory, they also carry increased risk, as borrowers with lower scores are more likely to default on loans. Ford Credit stated that it only finances customers it deems creditworthy and that the promotional rates do not alter its fundamental credit decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have identified a massive and mysterious object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. If confirmed, this discovery would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed before black holes. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed from quantum fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang, predating any stars. While further observation is needed to verify its nature, the object's existence in a region with little surrounding matter supports the hypothesis. The finding could force a significant revision of our understanding of cosmic evolution.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady has responded to criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox, positions some believe create a conflict of interest. Critics argue his access to other teams as an analyst gives the Raiders an unfair advantage. In his newsletter, Brady dismissed these concerns as products of paranoia and distrust, stating that his passion for football creates a moral duty to improve the game, not a conflict. He asserted that the intersection of his roles is where his ethical responsibility emerges, reframing the potential dilemma as a commitment to the sport's growth.</p>

          <p>Attorneys within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allege that the Trump administration has effectively stopped the enforcement of anti-discrimination housing laws. According to whistleblowers from HUD's Office of Fair Housing, the department's work to combat residential segregation has been stymied by political appointees who consider it a low priority and an "optics problem." The office has faced significant downsizing through firings and reassignments, and a gag order has reportedly slowed litigation. These actions are seen as part of a broader shift in the administration's approach to civil rights enforcement, potentially undoing decades of progress.</p>

          <p>A collective of nearly 100 current and former physicians from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has issued a letter warning that Trump administration policies are threatening veterans' healthcare. The letter, sent to congressional leaders, expresses alarm over staffing cuts and an aggressive push toward privatization, which they argue will divert resources and potentially lead to facility closures. The doctors contend that these changes force veterans into overburdened private health systems that are ill-equipped to handle their specialized needs.
