          <p>Qualcomm has partnered with BMW to launch the Snapdragon Ride Pilot Automated Driving System, a driver-assist feature enabling hands-free driving and lane changes, set to debut on the BMW iX3 and expand to 100 countries by 2026. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon expects this collaboration to trigger a "domino effect," prompting other automakers to license the technology. This move highlights Qualcomm's strategic diversification from smartphone chips into the rapidly growing automotive sector, with projected revenue reaching $8 billion by 2029. The company aims to provide a fully integrated solution for autonomous driving, contrasting with traditional European car firms perceived as lagging in this technology.</p>

          <p>Australia announced a $1.1 billion investment to acquire a fleet of domestically developed "Ghost Shark" underwater attack drones, aiming to bolster its naval capabilities. Defense Minister Richard Marles stated that Australia is leading in autonomous underwater military technology, with the first batch of these long-range, stealth-capable drones expected by January next year. The deployment of these drones, which can be launched from shore or surface ships, is a strategic move to counter China's military expansion in the Pacific. These autonomous vessels will complement Australia's existing fleet of US nuclear-powered submarines, significantly enhancing the nation's underwater defense.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a broad rally, mirroring gains on Wall Street, driven by growing hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut and the assessment of China's August inflation data. South Korea's Kospi index reached a record high, extending its winning streak, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also climbed significantly. Despite a slight dip in China's consumer prices, the overall market sentiment was buoyed by regional developments, including a funding round for a Chinese humanoid startup led by Alibaba Cloud. Shares of Asian tech firms in Apple's supply chain also traded higher following new iPhone launches, though Apple's own stock saw a decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council condemned China's "irrational" intimidation of a Taiwanese medical evacuation flight by its warplanes, calling it a serious threat to flight safety and humanitarian operations. Officials stated this incident represents a new pattern of "aerial grey-zone harassment" by the People's Liberation Army, designed to assert jurisdiction over the Taiwan Strait's airspace and test Taiwan's military responses. This provocation, targeting even medical aircraft, reflects a disregard for human life and a challenge to universal values, according to the council, which demanded an immediate halt to such actions. The incident underscores escalating tensions in the region.</p>

Pioneered by Aaron 'Wheelz' Fotheringham in 2000, WCMX is now worldwide, with its World Championships returning to Europe. The sport's governing body is actively pursuing inclusion in the Paralympics, aiming for a test event at LA 2028 and full inclusion by Brisbane 2032, despite current hurdles with the International Paralympic Committee.</p>

          <p>A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reveals that American companies operating in China are more pessimistic about their five-year business outlook than ever before. Only 41% expressed optimism, a significant drop from 2021, while a record 37% reported a pessimistic view. This decline is attributed primarily to the uncertain US-China relationship, intense local competition, and China's economic slowdown. Chinese counterparts are increasingly innovative, making it harder for multinational companies to succeed by merely replicating Western strategies. This waning sentiment contributes to a broader pullback in foreign direct investment into China.</p>

          <p>Europe's contentious 2035 ban on new diesel and gasoline car sales is back in focus, sparking a division within the auto industry. Over 150 electric vehicle industry leaders, including Volvo and Polestar, urged the European Commission to uphold the target, citing hundreds of billions in new investments and warning against ceding competitive advantage to rivals like China. Conversely, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and auto suppliers (CLEPA), representing major brands like Mercedes and Volkswagen, argue the target is "no longer feasible" and needs recalibration to protect industrial competitiveness and supply chains. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also criticized "one-sided political commitments to specific technologies," adding to the pressure ahead of crucial talks between auto bosses and the EU.</p>

          <p>Despite only securing two Premier League wins since April, statistical analysis suggests Manchester United's underlying performances have been better than their results indicate under Ruben Amorim. The team has taken the most shots and faced fewer shots than most rivals in their last ten games, suggesting strong chance creation and restriction. However, a significant underperformance in both scoring and saving goals has led to a paltry points tally. While the exact cause remains unclear—ranging from player quality to confidence or bad luck—the article notes that Amorim's tactics might be contributing to lower-quality shots taken and higher-quality shots conceded.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has reportedly called on the European Union to implement tariffs of up to 100% on China and India, aiming to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. This demand, made during a meeting with US and EU officials, seeks to economically target major buyers of Russian oil, which helps sustain the Russian economy. The proposal follows an escalation of Russian attacks on Ukraine and Trump's previous, unfulfilled threats of harsher sanctions. If adopted, these tariffs would mark a significant shift in the EU's approach to isolating Russia, potentially further destabilizing global trade relations and impacting US-India trade negotiations.</p>

Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy, saw a slight rise, but analysts suggest this reflects temporary factors rather than a significant improvement in supply-demand imbalances. Economists are increasing calls for Beijing to implement stronger fiscal support to boost domestic demand and counteract weakening exports, as deflationary concerns continue to weigh on the economy.

This rise is largely attributed to unhealthy food environments dominated by ultra-processed and fast foods, which are high in sugar, unhealthy fats, and additives.

          <h2>Whistleblowers Allege Meta Covered Up Potential Child Harms from VR Products and Suppressed Research</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former Meta safety researchers testified before a US Senate committee, alleging that Meta covered up potential harms to children from its virtual reality (VR) products and instructed researchers to avoid work that could produce evidence of such harm. Jason Sattizahn and Cayce Savage claimed Meta lawyers intervened to shape internal research and demanded the erasure of evidence regarding sexual assault risks on VR platforms. Savage specifically cited identifying coordinated sexual predator rings using Roblox on Meta's headsets. Meta denies the allegations, calling them "nonsense" and based on selectively leaked documents. The company maintains it has approved numerous studies on youth safety, but parental controls remain difficult to navigate.</p>

          <p>China is set to implement a new "Law on Promoting Ethnic Unity and Progress," emphasizing the widespread use of the Chinese language and fostering a unified national identity. The draft legislation, submitted to the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, aims to strengthen interethnic exchanges through cultural, educational, and tourism initiatives. State news agency Xinhua reported that the law is deemed "an urgent requirement" to build a strong sense of community among the Chinese nation. President Xi Jinping chaired a Politburo meeting discussing the draft, stressing the need to uphold the Party’s leadership and follow the "correct Chinese path to solving ethnic issues."</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team secured a 2-0 victory against a rotated Japan side, with goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun, signaling improved comfort and confidence. Coach Mauricio Pochettino's strategic rotation and new 3-4-2-1 formation allowed less-experienced players to shine, with standout performances from Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten. While Balogun missed early chances and goalkeeper Matt Freese showed some uncertainty, the team maintained pressure and dominance throughout the match, a marked improvement from previous outings. This performance suggests Pochettino's plan to develop a deeper roster and peak for the World Cup is showing early positive signs.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following widespread public outrage and violent youth-led anti-corruption protests that resulted in 22 deaths. The demonstrations, primarily mobilized by Gen Z on social media, were initially sparked by a now-repealed ban on 26 social media platforms, but quickly escalated to address deep-rooted dissatisfaction with government corruption. Protesters clashed with police, setting fire to parliament and vandalizing political leaders' homes. The army chief, General Ashok Raj Sigdel, has called for dialogue while also warning against continued unrest. The protests highlight a leaderless, social media-driven movement demanding accountability and reforms, with an uncertain political future for the nation.</p>

          <p>Michael James Pratt, the founder of the GirlsDoPorn website and once on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, has been sentenced to 27 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and committing sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion. Forty victims testified, detailing how they were lured with modeling promises but then coerced and forced into sexual acts on camera. Pratt and his accomplices threatened lawsuits and exposure if women refused to comply. Victims, many aged 18-21 at the time, shared profound long-term trauma, including family estrangement, mental health struggles, and identity changes. Their testimonies underscored their empowerment in bringing him to justice.</p>

          <p>Plans to distribute the remaining £25 million fortune of the disgraced evangelical sect, the Jesus Army, could see individuals accused of child abuse receiving significantly larger payments than their alleged victims. The organization, which previously paid £7.7 million in compensation to 601 abuse survivors, intends to divide the remaining assets among loyal members. Survivors, many of whom were child victims, criticized the initial redress scheme as ungenerous and primarily insurer-funded. Concerns are mounting that some of the 172 listed beneficiaries, who will vote on expanding the recipient group, may include alleged perpetrators or those who covered up offenses, sparking outrage among survivors who feel the proposals are "sickening."</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement to resume cooperation, including restarting inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi called the deal a "step in the right direction," emphasizing the "indispensable" nature of inspections under the non-proliferation treaty. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the deal addresses his country's security concerns but warned it would terminate if UN sanctions were reimposed. This framework emerges as Germany, France, and the UK began reimposing sanctions, citing Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 agreement. The IAEA has been particularly focused on over 400 kilograms of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, whose storage location remains undisclosed by Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's Greater Bay Area is an ideal candidate to host the 2036 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, offering a cost-effective solution to the economic burdens often associated with the event. The region boasts extensive existing sports facilities across cities like Shenzhen, Macau, and Guangzhou, eliminating the need for new construction. Hong Kong's harbor could provide a scenic backdrop for temporary venues, further reducing costs. Crucially, the Greater Bay Area's robust and expanding transport network is uniquely positioned to meet the logistical demands of housing athletes within a 45-minute radius of their competition venues, exceeding Olympic committee requirements.</p>
