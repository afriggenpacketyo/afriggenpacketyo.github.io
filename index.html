          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to the newly elected leader of Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) party, emphasizing their shared political foundation of opposing Taiwanese independence. Citing the "1992 consensus," Xi called for joint efforts to advance the "reunification" of Taiwan with mainland China. The new KMT leader responded by expressing a commitment to strengthening cross-strait communication and promoting peace, a development that occurs amid heightened tensions since the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which does not accept the one-China principle, took power in 2016.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis explores unconventional yet burgeoning applications for solar power technology beyond traditional rooftop panels. These innovative uses include integrating solar cells into roads, parking lots, and even railway tracks to generate electricity for local use, such as charging electric vehicles or powering trains. Other expanding areas are building facades with invisible solar cells, "agrivoltaics" where panels are placed above crops for a dual harvest, and large-scale floating solar parks on lakes and seas. The article also touches on the futuristic, though currently impractical, concept of beaming solar energy from space.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the cycle of tit-for-tat escalation between the United States and China in the technology sector is no longer an anomaly but a defining feature of the global landscape. For decades, the world operated on a US-centric tech order, but now China is leveraging its dominance in rare earths processing while the US uses its powerful sanctioning capabilities. The article suggests each nation is testing the other's limits, creating a systemic conflict that challenges the previously established "one system" model of global technology standards and platforms.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a new strategy to bolster the country's clean energy workforce, promising the creation of 400,000 additional jobs by the year 2030. The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers and electricians, to support the expansion of renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear energy sectors. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to retrain veterans and others for careers in clean energy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative aims to lower energy bills and provide well-paid, secure jobs in industrial heartlands. (not investment advice)</p>

The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare (SMT), targeted mostly elderly victims with high-pressure sales tactics, convincing them to buy useless "credits" instead of helping them exit their contracts. A 2016 BBC Scotland programme used secret filming to expose the company's "bait-and-switch" scam, providing crucial evidence for the police investigation.

          <p>A Greater Manchester Police sergeant, Tim Ansell, has received the King's Commendation for Bravery for his actions during a knife attack in July 2023. Newly released footage shows the moment Jacob Brown ambushed Sgt Marc Foster, holding a blade to his neck before Sgt Ansell intervened. Both officers were stabbed and slashed before a third officer, PC Marcus Wolstencroft, subdued the attacker with a Taser. Sgt Ansell suffered serious wounds to his neck and body, but the actions of the three officers prevented further harm to themselves or the public.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has accused the United States of carrying out "long-term, highly covert" cyberattacks against its National Time Service Centre. The facility, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is responsible for maintaining and distributing China's official standard time, which is critical for sectors like communications, finance, and defense. The ministry's statement alleged that the cyberespionage campaign employed state-level tools. This accusation adds another point of contention to the already tense relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant summer spending spree, Liverpool FC has experienced a recent slump, losing three consecutive matches. A tactical analysis suggests the team is feeling the effects of Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid more than anticipated. His absence has reportedly impacted Liverpool's ability to build up play from the back and bypass high-pressing opponents, as his unique passing range and ability with both feet are sorely missed. The article notes that new signings are being forced into deeper roles to compensate, potentially limiting their attacking effectiveness.</p>

          <h2>Psychologists Explain Why Sexual Desire Often Wanes in Long-Term Relationships</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychological analysis explores the common phenomenon of decreased sexual frequency in long-term relationships, attributing it to both hormonal changes and relational dynamics. According to a couple's therapist, the initial hormone cocktail that drives passion gives way to bonding hormones like oxytocin, which can dampen sex drive. The article also highlights that unmet sexual needs and a lack of non-sexual physical affection can disproportionately affect women's libido. Experts recommend open communication and prioritizing intimacy to sustain a healthy sex life over time.</p>

          <p>A "No Kings Day" protest in downtown Los Angeles escalated on Saturday evening, leading police to declare an unlawful assembly and use tear gas and other nonlethal rounds to disperse crowds. The demonstration had converged near the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility that has become a focus for anti-ICE sentiment. Tense standoffs occurred as demonstrators accused the LAPD of escalating the situation, which had been part of a day of largely peaceful nationwide rallies against the Trump administration's policies. No arrests were reported by the LAPD as of 9 p.m.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As rising temperatures and extreme weather put the UK's native trees under significant stress, Forestry England has released a list of thirty tree species better suited to thrive in a warmer future climate. The list includes native trees like oak and birch, as well as non-native species such as coast redwood and Corsican pine, aiming to create more diverse and resilient woodlands. This initiative addresses the concern that trees cannot migrate or adapt quickly enough to the rapid pace of human-driven climate change, which has already led to increased tree mortality during recent heatwaves.</p>
