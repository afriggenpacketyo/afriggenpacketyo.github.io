          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to unseal grand jury testimony related to Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted associate. The judge criticized the Department of Justice's reasoning as "demonstrably false," stating the materials contain little new information of public consequence. He noted that releasing the documents would not reveal new details about their crimes, identify other perpetrators, or shed light on Epstein's death. The judge suggested the motion might be a political "diversion" rather than a genuine effort for transparency, disappointing those expecting significant revelations.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Malawi's September elections, several presidential candidates have notably chosen women as their running mates, reflecting a push for greater gender inclusion in the nation's politics. This follows advocacy from civil organizations like the 50-50 Campaign, especially significant as women constitute over 57% of registered voters. However, some analysts express skepticism, noting that these women are in subordinate roles and often represent smaller parties, suggesting the move could be a strategic ploy rather than a fundamental shift. Voters appear more concerned with economic issues like food shortages and corruption than the gender of candidates alone.</p>

It contrasts national average yields with the significantly higher rates offered by online banks, which have lower overhead costs. The piece advises savers to consider short-term CDs, as an inverted yield curve currently makes their rates more competitive than long-term options. To maximize returns, it suggests strategies like shopping around at online banks and laddering CDs of varying terms. (not investment advice)</p>

The victim sustained serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene, despite efforts by emergency services, including an air ambulance.

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenue from sales of specific AI chips to China in exchange for export licenses. The deal, crafted by the Trump administration, allows the companies to resume selling their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed to comply with earlier export restrictions. While investors view the deal as a net positive since it reopens the lucrative Chinese market, analysts note the unprecedented nature of this "indirect tariff." The move raises questions about future government involvement in corporate sales and China's reaction to the arrangement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore-based semiconductor equipment maker ASMPT has announced the closure of its plant in Shenzhen, China, which will result in the loss of approximately 950 jobs. The company stated that it is implementing comprehensive support measures to assist the affected employees through the transition. ASMPT anticipates a one-time restructuring charge of about $50 million but expects the move to generate annual operating cost savings of around 115 million yuan. The company confirmed that its other major global manufacturing operations will not be affected by this closure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors has elicited mixed reactions globally, with some markets expressing relief over key exemptions. The proposed rule would not apply to companies that have already committed to or are in the process of building manufacturing facilities within the United States. This caveat has eased some uncertainty, aligning with the administration's strategy to onshore high-tech manufacturing. The article explores the potential impacts of this policy across different regions, highlighting the strategic focus on bolstering domestic production of critical technologies.

          <p>Finnish authorities have charged the captain and two senior officers of the Eagle S, a Russia-linked oil tanker, with damaging undersea power and communication cables in the Gulf of Finland last December. The vessel is accused of dragging its anchor for approximately 56 miles, causing at least €60 million in damages to vital infrastructure connecting Finland and Estonia. The defendants deny the charges and contest Finland's jurisdiction, as the incident occurred outside its territorial waters. The event is viewed by Western nations as part of a broader pattern of suspected sabotage linked to Moscow since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In a landmark move, Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for the UFC in a seven-year, $7.7 billion deal starting in 2026. This is one of the first major strategic decisions for Paramount following its merger with Skydance. The agreement will shift all UFC content, including marquee events, from a pay-per-view model to the Paramount+ streaming service, with select events also airing on CBS. TKO Group, UFC's parent company, views the deal as a way to make the sport more accessible to a broader audience and solidify its position as a top-tier sports asset.</p>

          <p>Ten years after China's surprise devaluation of the yuan sent shockwaves through global markets, its approach to managing its currency has become more sophisticated. Analysts note that Beijing now employs a diverse toolkit to handle exchange-rate volatility, reducing its reliance on depleting foreign reserves to defend the currency, a tactic used heavily after the 2015 reform. While the exchange rate is more market-based, it remains managed. The key challenge for the next decade will be to further internationalize the yuan and allow for greater market pricing without causing destabilizing swings in its value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article warns of a common "accidental deposit" scam on payment apps where a fraudster sends money from a stolen account and then asks for it back. The scammer's goal is to receive a transfer of the victim's own money before the original fraudulent transaction is reversed by the bank. If you receive an unexpected payment from a stranger, you should not send the money back or engage with the sender, even if they become aggressive. Instead, you should contact the payment app's customer support to report the incident and let them handle the reversal process.</p>

Furthermore, the U.S. plan to impose heavy tariffs on "transshipment" of Chinese goods via Southeast Asia could devastate industries that rely on assembling Chinese components. The influx of cheap Chinese goods into the region, avoiding U.S. markets, also threatens to suppress local wages and exacerbate inequality. (not investment advice)</p>
