          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula prompted extensive tsunami alerts for countries across the Pacific, including the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii, and Japan. While the quake's strength caused initial alarm and some evacuations, the resulting waves were smaller than feared in most areas, leading to minor flooding but no major damage or casualties outside of Russia. Most warnings were downgraded to advisories or canceled within hours, as officials confirmed the most significant danger had passed. The event served as a major test for regional tsunami warning systems.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee announced it will hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing a cautious approach due to an uncertain economic outlook. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that while the economy remains solid, inflation is still above the central bank's target, justifying the decision to wait for more data before considering any changes.

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, a significant turnaround from the 0.5% contraction in the first three months of the year. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports following the implementation of new tariffs, which statistically boosts GDP. However, economists caution that the headline figure may overstate the economy's underlying strength, as a key measure of private domestic demand showed its weakest growth since 2022.

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies have reportedly made a significant move before the MLB trade deadline, acquiring All-Star closer Jhoan Duran from the Minnesota Twins. In exchange, the Phillies are said to be sending top prospects, including right-handed pitcher Mick Abel, to the Twins. Duran, known for his triple-digit fastball, is expected to substantially bolster Philadelphia's bullpen as the team aims for a World Series run. The deal is also notable as Duran is under team control through the 2028 season.</p>

          <p>Shares of Arm Holdings fell significantly after the company reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that did not meet analyst expectations, largely due to weaker-than-anticipated royalty revenue from the smartphone sector. The chip architecture company also confirmed it is investing heavily in designing its own processors and chiplets, a strategic shift that could turn current customers into competitors. This move introduces new execution risks for the company, contributing to investor uncertainty and the stock's decline. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in minimal tsunami damage for most of the Pacific Rim. Scientists explain that the quake's energy was primarily directed into a vast, open stretch of the Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with the presence of deep-ocean sensors that provided rapid warnings, meant that a potential catastrophe was largely averted, representing a best-case scenario for a distant tsunami event.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has sharply criticized the UK government's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. In a social media post, she argued the move risks rewarding terrorism and sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy. She contends that by legitimizing a state while Hamas remains in control of Gaza, the UK is disincentivizing the release of the remaining hostages and undermining hopes for genuine peace. Her statement reflects deep concern among hostage families about the potential consequences of the diplomatic shift.</p>

          <p>A technical issue at a key UK air traffic control center caused a 20-minute outage that led to significant, cascading disruptions across the country's aviation network. The problem, described as "radar-related" by the national air traffic service (NATS), forced the grounding of thousands of flights and led to over 150 cancellations at major airports including Heathrow and Manchester. This is the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting apologies and calls from political leaders for an investigation into the repeated failures.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes new U.S. energy legislation, suggesting its focus on fossil fuels and nuclear power for energy independence may inadvertently cede leadership in the renewable energy sector to China. Proponents argue the policy is necessary to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities and close technological gaps with Beijing, which dominates critical mineral and clean tech manufacturing. However, critics warn that prioritizing short-term security over long-term sustainability could undermine U.S. competitiveness in the global green transition and harm climate goals.</p>

Democrats have denounced the map as illegal, racially discriminatory voter suppression and a brazen power grab, vowing to fight it with fierce legal challenges.

The White House stated the move is necessary to prevent tariff evasion and stop the flow of illicit drugs, but it is expected to raise prices for consumers who buy cheap items from international e-commerce sites.

The administration has called the case a "witch hunt," but the moves are seen as a shocking use of U.S. power to protect a foreign political ally, undermining diplomatic norms.</p>
