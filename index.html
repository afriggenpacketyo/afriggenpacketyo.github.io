          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals persistent negativity among Americans regarding the U.S. economy and job market, a trend observed for years. Rising prices remain the primary concern influencing economic perceptions, with most expecting continued increases despite some relief in gas prices. The survey also indicates widespread public suspicion that AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability over the next decade, impacting both currently employed individuals and those not working. This pervasive pessimism, spanning various income and education levels, has seen the number of people believing the economy is worsening tick up again.</p>

          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth saw a significant jump in extended trading after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company is in close communication with the Trump administration. This engagement aligns with the administration's strategy to strengthen the domestic rare earth supply chain, following its recent equity stakes in other key miners like Lithium Americas and MP Materials. Humpton indicated that the rare earth market is not a zero-sum game, requiring many participants, and supports the administration's efforts to reduce U.S. dependence on China. The company is actively developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, underscoring its role in these strategic initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Delta Air Lines planes, operated by its subsidiary Endeavor Air, were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Arriving Flight 5047 from Charlotte struck the wing of departing Flight 5155, which was holding as instructed by air traffic control. One flight attendant suffered a minor injury and received medical attention. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the cause, recovering flight recorders from both aircraft for analysis. Despite the incident, airport operations remained unaffected, and passengers were safely deplaned and provided with alternative travel arrangements.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon is under scrutiny, characterized as chaotic and image-focused rather than substantively strategic, as highlighted by a New York magazine feature. This comes after President Trump suggested deploying the military to U.S. cities for training, an unusual directive for the armed forces. Hegseth, a former television host, is perceived as lacking the deep experience of his predecessors, leading to concerns about impulse control, personnel issues, and a reliance on a personal entourage. Critics argue his demonstrated loyalty to Trump, rather than strong ideological convictions, primarily secures his position, potentially hindering the department's independent functioning.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has submitted a letter to the court, expressing full responsibility and deep remorse for his past actions, including the assault of Cassie Ventura. Ahead of his sentencing for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, Combs claimed to be sober for the first time in 25 years, attributing his transformation to a "spiritual reset" during incarceration. While his legal team requested a 14-month penalty, prosecutors are seeking a minimum of 11 years.

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou faces mounting pressure and fan chants for his dismissal after failing to secure a win in his first six games, marking a century-long club record. A damaging 3-2 Europa League defeat by Midtjylland, following a Premier League loss, has intensified scrutiny of his leadership, especially given the club's significant summer spending. Despite the taunts, Postecoglou remains defiant, expressing belief in his coaching process and the team's proximity to a breakthrough.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Goldman Sachs study reveals that a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are living paycheck to paycheck, making retirement savings increasingly unattainable. Approximately 42% of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X workers report having no spare savings, a figure projected to exceed 50% by 2033 due to rising living costs. The report challenges the simplistic advice to "save more," emphasizing that escalating expenses like housing and healthcare consume a larger share of income. This financial vortex, exacerbated by the shift from pensions to 401(k)s, leaves many nearing retirement without adequate savings. (not investment advice)</p>

The updated cards, which began issuance on Wednesday, feature new imagery of California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline, replacing older designs like the gold miner. Existing licenses remain valid until their expiration date, with no immediate need for replacement, and renewal fees are unchanged. This redesign also removes the magnetic stripe and maintains the REAL ID symbol, reflecting periodic efforts to improve security and prevent counterfeiting since the last major update in 2010.</p>

Vought has already announced the cancellation of billions in energy and infrastructure projects, particularly targeting New York. While legal experts argue the administration lacks the authority for permanent layoffs during a temporary appropriations lapse, Vought, a key architect of the conservative Project 2025, views the shutdown as an opportunity to reduce the federal government's size.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially declared an "armed conflict" against drug cartels, designating them as "nonstate armed groups" engaged in an "armed attack against the United States." This controversial declaration, communicated to congressional committees, seeks to retroactively justify recent military strikes in the Caribbean that resulted in 17 deaths aboard alleged drug boats. Critics contend that this designation is a legal maneuver to expand military powers beyond international law's reasonable definition of armed conflict. The move signifies Trump's broader strategy to escalate pressure on entities like Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, raising significant legal and international concerns regarding the scope of executive authority.</p>

However, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer explicitly labeled this an "absolute lie." While Democrats are advocating to extend Obamacare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, these programs do not cover undocumented immigrants, and Democrats have not proposed changing existing federal law.

          <p>Pop star Chappell Roan was spotted exploring the local vintage fashion scene at Daisy Lee Vintage in Kansas City, ahead of her highly anticipated weekend performances. The "Midwest Princess" casually visited the small business after being inspired by a unique bag she saw at a popular nearby cafe, Mildred's, leading her directly to the shop. Although she didn't make a purchase, her presence generated significant excitement among the store's staff and local fans, who shared a photo with the singer. Roan is headlining two sold-out shows at the National World War I Museum & Memorial, and her engagement with local businesses adds a personal touch to her tour stop.</p>

          <h2>Federal Law Enforcement Surge in D.C. Shows High Rate of Immigration-Related Arrests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internal government data reveals that nearly 40% of over 3,500 arrests made during the Trump administration's federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., were strictly immigration-related. While President Trump publicly framed the operation as a crackdown on violent crime, nearly 1,400 of these arrests were administrative actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), focusing on alleged civil immigration violations. The remaining arrests did have a criminal nexus, including homicide suspects, narcotics, and firearms offenses. Despite the official "crime emergency" ending, federal and local agencies continue to cooperate on immigration enforcement, raising significant concerns among civil rights groups about potential sweeps and heightened fear within immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A team of treasure hunters off Florida's aptly named "treasure coast" has discovered over 1,000 silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, from a 1715 Spanish fleet shipwreck.

This rare and extraordinary find, with visible dates and mint marks, offers valuable historical insights into the Spanish empire's golden age and maritime trade. The discovery not only yields significant monetary value but also provides tangible links to the people and rich history of centuries past, making each coin a cherished piece of history.</p>

          <p>Paramore lead singer Hayley Williams confirmed that Morgan Wallen is the "racist country singer" referenced in her song "Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party."

          <p>Conservation groups are urging the public to stay out of U.S. national parks during the government shutdown, warning of significant risks due to skeleton staffing. The National Park Service's decision to keep parks partially open with furloughed staff raises concerns about visitor safety and potential damage to natural resources, echoing problems seen in the 2018 shutdown. With limited facilities, communication staff, and emergency services, visitors are essentially "on their own" and could face long waits for assistance. Conservationists emphasize that mass layoffs earlier this year already strained park resources, making the current situation even more precarious for these vital public lands.</p>

Scholars emphasize Lucumí's focus on health, well-being, and character, challenging persistent stereotypes that demonize it as "witchcraft" or "black magic."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has publicly urged his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, accusing the streaming service of promoting a "transgender woke agenda." The controversy appears to stem from conservative backlash against Netflix's animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park," which featured a transgender character and was canceled in 2023. Musk also amplified criticism of the show's creator, Hamish Steele, over alleged remarks concerning a conservative activist's death. Analysts, however, suggest that while such calls for boycotts can create headlines, they are unlikely to significantly impact Netflix's subscriber numbers or stock value, citing the company's large base and resilience to similar past controversies.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has yet to issue final guidelines for administering new COVID-19 vaccines, leaving millions, especially children, in limbo regarding access. This unusual delay prevents the federal Vaccines for Children Program from distributing shots and creates widespread confusion among the public and healthcare providers, who report daily requests for the vaccine. The situation is further exacerbated by the government shutdown, which halts any potential action. Experts criticize the CDC's inaction, warning it will harm public health and lead to more COVID-19 cases, particularly as the crucial winter respiratory season approaches, despite previous FDA approval for at-risk individuals.</p>
