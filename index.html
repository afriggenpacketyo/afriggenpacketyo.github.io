          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, is undergoing a bail hearing after being detained by ICE following the revocation of her student visa by the Trump administration. Ozturk's lawyers argue that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, as she was allegedly targeted for criticizing Israel and participating in pro-Palestinian protests. Tufts president Sunil Kumar has defended Ozturk, stating the university has no information to support the allegations against her. Ozturk claims she has suffered multiple asthma attacks in ICE detention due to poor conditions and limited medical attention, and the hearing will determine if she will be released while her case is adjudicated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and U.K. have reached a trade deal that includes tariffs, suggesting that President Trump's reciprocal tariff policy is here to stay. The agreement allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff rate, with additional vehicles facing higher duties, while steel and aluminum exports will be tariff-free. This deal indicates that a 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners, though sector-specific deals with carve-outs are possible. Analysts suggest this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with the U.S. maintaining flexibility on sectoral tariffs but generally adhering to a minimum 10% tariff.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are expected to substantially raise the cost of baby products, potentially adding up to $1,000 a year for new parents, according to industry players. Manufacturers are dealing with the shock of tariffs on products and are looking at what it takes to onshore products, but it takes time and investment. These tariffs, including those on Chinese products and a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, are prompting calls for exemptions on essential baby items. The rising costs are also driving more parents to resale platforms to find discounted goods, reflecting the financial strain on families.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed a tepid endorsement of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans while acknowledging the political challenges of such a move. Trump indicated he would "graciously" accept a small tax increase on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but also cautioned Republicans against it, citing potential backlash. This stance signals a willingness to deviate from traditional Republican tax policies, though he remains wary of potential political repercussions. Trump's consideration of this tax hike comes as part of a larger tax and spending bill aimed at navigating a divided Congress.</p>

          <p>Deep Dasgupta suggests that the restart of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will depend on the "mood of the nation" and the availability of overseas players. Most English and Australian players are expected to leave India, potentially impacting the tournament's resumption. If a short-term restart is not possible, there is a strong desire to complete the tournament later in the year due to its financial value. The Asia Cup, initially scheduled for September, may be scrapped to accommodate the IPL, and long-term questions persist over future matches between India and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>The White House is expected to send Congress a rescissions package to claw back congressionally approved funding, aiming to formalize spending cuts amid legal challenges. The rescission process allows Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds that have not been spent, reallocating them or returning them to the Treasury. Congressional Republicans are optimistic about the process and eager to begin, targeting around $9 billion in cuts, primarily from foreign aid and public broadcasting. The move comes as the administration seeks to make permanent some of the spending reductions initiated by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

Studies have shown that self-collected samples using the device are as accurate as clinician-collected samples.

Community advocates emphasize that these businesses are integral to Chinatown's ecosystem, providing essential goods at low prices to a sizable population of families and seniors.
