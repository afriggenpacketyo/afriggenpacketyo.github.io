        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon has authorized some National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., to carry their service-issued weapons, a significant escalation in their deployment. This directive from the Secretary of Defense reverses a previous policy where troops were unarmed. While officials cite security concerns, the move comes amid President Trump's broader law enforcement crackdown in the capital, which local officials have described as unnecessary. The troops' role has primarily been non-confrontational, focusing on protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control, with no reported threats that would necessitate armament.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark has taken a significant step toward returning to the court after being sidelined with a groin injury since mid-July. She was observed participating in low-intensity, non-contact drills during a team shootaround, which her coach described as a positive development in her recovery process. Clark's potential return is crucial for the Fever, who are fighting for a playoff spot while dealing with season-ending injuries to several other key players. Her presence would provide a much-needed boost as the team navigates the final stretch of the regular season.</p>

          <p>The French government has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner in response to a letter he sent to President Emmanuel Macron, which accused France of not adequately combating a rise in antisemitism. France's foreign ministry strongly rejected the allegations, calling them an unacceptable interference in the country's internal affairs that violates diplomatic protocols. The incident highlights growing diplomatic friction between the two allies, which has also been strained by recent trade disputes and differing stances on international issues. The summons represents a public expression of displeasure from Paris.</p>

          <p>Once China's largest property developer, Evergrande has been officially delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking the final stage of its dramatic collapse. The company, which was valued at over $50 billion at its peak, crumbled under $300 billion in debt, triggering a wider crisis in China's real estate sector. The delisting is seen as a symbolic milestone in a slump that has been a major drag on the world's second-largest economy, impacting consumer confidence and local government finances. Experts believe the property crisis is not over, with other developers still facing significant financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report details the devastating human cost of crashes on the A9, Scotland's longest and most dangerous trunk road, where 48 people have died in the last decade. The article shares the story of an American family who lost three members in a 2022 crash, highlighting the risks posed by the road's mix of single and dual carriageways. Despite a long-standing promise to fully dual the road by 2025, the project has been delayed by a decade to 2035, drawing criticism from safety advocates. The ongoing dangers underscore the urgent need for infrastructure improvements.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Monday, following a positive trend from Wall Street. The rally was spurred by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who indicated that the central bank might begin to ease its monetary policy and cut interest rates as early as next month. Major indexes in Japan, South Korea, and Australia all climbed, reflecting investor optimism about a less restrictive financial environment. This potential shift in Fed policy is seen as a positive catalyst for global markets, which have been closely watching for signs of relief from high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

While the filing does not claim LA officials were bribed, it aims to establish a pattern of corrupt behavior as part of the ongoing case against the executives.

This comes as the Pentagon confirmed planning is underway for such a deployment, following similar actions in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. Both Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor have condemned the plan as an unconstitutional abuse of power, stating that no federal assistance has been requested. Critics argue the president is playing political games and targeting Democratic-led cities with Black mayors.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse has been abruptly removed from his position as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a senior defense official confirmed. No official reason was provided for the ouster, which reportedly surprised DIA employees and congressional intelligence leaders. The move comes after the DIA produced an assessment on Iranian nuclear facilities that contradicted President Trump's more optimistic public statements, leading to speculation that the firing was politically motivated. This is the latest in a series of removals of senior military and national security officials under the current administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A human case of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, has been identified in a person in Maryland who had recently traveled from Guatemala. Screwworm flies lay eggs in the wounds of warm-blooded animals, and the hatched larvae burrow through living flesh, which can be fatal if untreated. While rare in humans, the case is alarming for the U.S. livestock industry, as an outbreak could be devastating to cattle herds. The incident heightens concerns about the parasite's northward spread from Central America and has prompted calls for increased preventative measures.</p>

          <p>Despite a £200 million summer investment in new forwards, Manchester United is experiencing early teething problems with its attack, having scored only one goal from open play in its first two Premier League games. The team's new frontline, including Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, and Bryan Mbeumo, has yet to form a cohesive unit, creating chances but failing to convert them effectively. Manager Ruben Amorim remains confident that the goals will come as the new players integrate. However, the lack of offensive output is a growing concern after the team also struggled to score last season.</p>
