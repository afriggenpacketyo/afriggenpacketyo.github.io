            <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after being suspended for over 24 hours due to track-switching work related to a new route that will improve access to Haneda airport.

            <p>Taiwan is facing increasing concerns about espionage as a growing number of cases involving individuals closely associated with senior Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians are under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence. These breaches, involving aides to Taiwanese leader Lai and National Security Council secretary general Joseph Wu, have raised alarms about Beijing's intensifying efforts to undermine Taiwan authorities from within. Analysts suggest that China's espionage network in Taiwan is highly effective, exploiting vulnerabilities in Taiwan's counter-intelligence systems. Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have worsened since Lai took office.</p>

            <h2>Putin Announces Temporary Easter Ceasefire in Ukraine</h2>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening until midnight on Sunday, citing humanitarian reasons. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that if Russia genuinely observes a full ceasefire, Ukraine will reciprocate and only strike in defense, proposing an extension beyond Easter Day. However, Ukrainian officials expressed skepticism, pointing to Russia's rejection of a previous 30-day ceasefire proposal and ongoing military activity along the front lines. The announcement coincided with a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, mediated by the United Arab Emirates.</p>

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to begin in 750 schools across England next week, offering free morning childcare for thousands of parents until July. The initiative, part of a larger plan, aims to provide up to 95 additional hours of care for primary-aged children, saving parents an estimated £450 annually. However, teaching unions have voiced concerns that the government funding allocated for the scheme may be insufficient to cover the full costs, potentially straining already tight school budgets.</p>
