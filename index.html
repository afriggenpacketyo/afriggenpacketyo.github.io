          <p>President Trump announced that he will nominate a replacement for interim U.S. attorney Ed Martin, whose nomination faced opposition in the Senate. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" activist, was appointed on an interim basis and can serve until May 20. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, stated that he would not vote to advance Martin's nomination, leading to Trump's decision to seek an alternative candidate. Trump expressed disappointment but affirmed his intention to announce a new nominee soon, promising a "great" replacement.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years, motivated by global challenges such as children's health and climate change, and inspired by Andrew Carnegie's views on wealth distribution. Gates, currently the world's fifth-richest person, emphasized his determination not to die rich, stating that resources should be used to help people. While increasing his philanthropic efforts, Gates also criticized the multibillion-dollar foreign aid cuts by the U.S. and other wealthy countries, stating that philanthropy alone cannot compensate for governmental funding reductions. The Gates Foundation, which he founded with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates, will close at the end of 2045 after giving away virtually all of his wealth.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in swing districts are facing difficult decisions as key House panels prepare to consider legislation that would cut popular programs to fund President Trump's agenda. Representative Gabe Evans of Colorado, whose district includes a significant number of Medicaid recipients, sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is tasked with slashing Medicaid spending by $880 billion over the next decade. This puts Evans and other Republicans in a challenging position as they try to balance supporting the President's agenda with the needs of their constituents, potentially jeopardizing their chances of re-election.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House has passed a bill to codify President Trump's executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America." The legislation, introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, passed with a vote of 211 to 206, with only one Republican voting against it. The bill instructs federal agencies to update all documents and maps accordingly, with oversight by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. Democrats strongly opposed the measure, calling it a "small-minded, silly, and sycophantic bill," while Speaker Mike Johnson endorsed it as a way to ensure President Trump's actions cannot be reversed by future administrations.</p>

          <p>Former CDC staff members are raising alarms about the significant budget and staffing cuts at the agency, describing the situation as a "five alarm fire." These cuts, part of the Trump Administration's plan to reduce the size of the federal government, have resulted in the loss of thousands of colleagues since January, leading to demoralization among public health workers and decreased ability to track and respond to health threats. Programs dedicated to injury prevention, sexual health, and workplace hazard reduction have been decimated, raising concerns about the nation's vulnerability to various health dangers. While an HHS spokesperson defended the changes as a necessary strategic effort, former CDC officials warn that it will take decades to recover from these interruptions, with many people potentially dying as a result.</p>

Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. Discussions on pharmaceuticals are ongoing, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to political scientists, America has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. The Trump administration has weaponized government agencies and taken punitive actions against critics, raising the cost of opposition for many Americans. Examples include investigations into political opponents, targeting law firms perceived as unfriendly, and media outlets facing lawsuits and politicized regulatory actions. The authors argue that this authoritarian offensive has changed how Americans behave, forcing them to think twice about engaging in constitutionally protected opposition, leading to self-censorship and a retreat from the public sphere.</p>

Analysts suggest that the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and continued buying from spot-ETF investors are supporting Bitcoin's performance. However, the article indicates that Bitcoin's resilience may be tested further by global macro and geopolitical factors, such as rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rates.</p>

The prosecutor has not yet decided whether to retry the case, while Lyoya's family expressed disappointment and urged for a retrial.

          <p>President Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since imposing new tariffs in April, but the specifics remain unclear. The deal includes increased market access for American exports and reduced non-tariff barriers, but the 10% blanket U.S. tariff on UK imports will remain in place. The agreement adjusts tariffs on UK autos and creates new export opportunities for U.S. farmers. Both countries commit to enhancing industrial and agricultural market access, streamline customs procedures, and establish commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which he claims will include billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports, particularly agricultural products. However, details are still being finalized. While a 10% baseline tariff on imported goods from all U.S. trade partners remains in effect, the deal will reduce tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. The overtures with the U.K. could be the first of other trade agreements, as the Trump administration is in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and other trading partners.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, but the 10% tariff on U.K. imports will remain. Under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, with additional vehicles facing 25% rates. The agreement will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S., and Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs.</p>

Universities UK (UUK) describes the report as "deeply sobering," while the education secretary highlights the necessity of raising tuition fees in England.
