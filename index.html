          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, escalating trade war concerns as the OECD ministers gather. This move has strained relationships with trading partners and prompted negotiations to avert further duties. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to these tariffs, with the U.S. economy expected to experience the most significant repercussions. While some of Trump's tariffs face legal challenges, they remain in effect during the appeals process, causing tension with the EU, Canada, and Mexico, all of whom have expressed strong objections.

          <p>Tesla experienced a sales rebound in Australia in May, reaching its highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong Model Y sales. Australian sales of the Model Y soared 122.5% year over year, while sales of the company's Model 3 dropped significantly. Total deliveries in Australia were up just 9.3% year over year but surged over 675% from April when the company sold only 500 EVs. Despite this, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to last year, indicating ongoing global headwinds for the company.</p>

          <p>President Trump has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics warn this could harm steel producers outside the U.S., provoke retaliation, and increase costs for American users of the metals. The UK received an exemption from the increased tariffs, maintaining duties at 25%, contingent upon the ratification of the recent trade pact with the U.S. Economists predict the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors reliant on steel and aluminum.

          <p>BBC research indicates that only 1% of domestic abuse-related death reviews are completed within the recommended six-month timeframe, with most taking years. Bereaved families describe the review process as "hell on earth" and believe that speedier reviews could prevent further deaths. Families also report that the delayed reviews exacerbate their emotional distress and hinder their ability to heal. The government is creating a new oversight board to expedite the review process, but even with a proposed extension to 12 months, most reviews would still miss the deadline.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized President Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination." Musk, a former Trump ally, stated that the bill would massively increase the budget deficit and burden American citizens with unsustainable debt. Senator Bernie Sanders unexpectedly echoed Musk's sentiments, describing the bill as an "abomination" that favors the wealthiest Americans while cutting food aid for the poor. Trump's bill aims to extend tax breaks from his first term, partly financed by cuts in social benefits.</p>

A Royal College of Physicians report graded her care as "poor" due to the use of an inappropriate access site.
