          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced an $8 billion write-down on its ambitious domestic "gigaprojects," such as the futuristic city Neom, according to its annual report. Despite the fund's total assets growing to nearly $1 trillion, the decline in these key investments highlights the financial pressures facing the kingdom from lower oil prices and a growing budget deficit. This signals potential scaling back of some elements of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan.</p>

          <p>This article explores the historical and geographical significance of Alaska as the chosen location for the summit between Presidents Trump and Putin. Once a Russian colony sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, the state's proximity to Russia made it a strategic front line during the Cold War. Today, its unique history as a place with both American and Russian ties provides a symbolic backdrop for the high-stakes talks aimed at addressing the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Logistics experts are warning that while consumers have not yet felt the full inflationary impact of recent tariffs, significant price hikes are currently hidden in the supply chain. U.S. importers have pulled freight forward to avoid rates, causing inventory to build up in warehouses and distribution centers, known as the "middle mile." As this inventory moves to retail shelves in the coming months, consumers should expect to see higher prices on goods for the back-to-school and holiday seasons.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, a beloved grocery market that has served L.A.'s Chinatown for 18 years, is set to close in September. The owner cites a confluence of pressures, including gentrification that has displaced residents, a series of robberies and assaults, and reduced foot traffic due to community fear following recent ICE raids. The closure marks a significant loss of affordable, fresh food and a vital community hub for the neighborhood's elderly and low-income populations.</p>

          <p>Drawing from its historical archives, this article examines the changing concept of "genius" over the centuries. The definition has shifted from an innate, divine spirit to a quantifiable trait studied by science, a path that led to the flawed and bigoted theories of eugenics. The piece argues that while individual talent is real, genius is also deeply influenced by social conditions, luck, and timing, noting that even 19th-century writers recognized the importance of circumstance.</p>
