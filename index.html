          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's Republican congressional delegation urged President Trump to reconsider FEMA's denial of disaster relief following deadly storms.  The denial follows similar denials to other states, prompting concerns about the federal government's response to natural disasters.  The request for relief cited catastrophic damage, widespread destruction, and loss of life.  This marks a rare instance of Republicans publicly challenging FEMA's decisions.</p>
