          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth assured Congress that lawmakers would be involved in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance, addressing concerns about the pact's future following reports of a Pentagon review. Hegseth's statement came in response to questions from US congressman Joe Courtney, who expressed worries about the review's timeframe, given the years of development behind the security pact between Australia, Britain, and the US. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson stated China's opposition to actions that amplify nuclear proliferation risks and exacerbate the arms race, highlighting the alliance's objective to counter China's regional influence.</p>

          <p>Kweichow Moutai, China's prominent liquor distiller, is responding to Beijing's renewed emphasis on austerity by distancing itself from lavish lifestyles. Management has committed to thrift guidelines, removing the expensive baijiu liquor from government banquets, which has narrowed the firm's profit margin. Moutai chairman Zhang Deqin referenced classic Chinese texts, emphasizing the liquor's role in promoting culture, health, and harmony. Moutai's strong liquor has been a preferred drink for Chinese officials since the early years of the Communist Party, often given as official gifts.</p>

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the remaining rape charge after a juror reported feeling threatened by another. This decision followed a partial verdict where Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley but not guilty of the same charge against Kaja Sokola. Some jurors expressed disappointment, indicating that most felt Weinstein should be convicted on the remaining count, but one juror refused to change his mind. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced his office intends to retry the rape charge, while Weinstein's team suggested a third trial is unnecessary, citing potential juror misconduct.</p>

Trump has previously stated he restrained Israel from attacking Iranian nuclear facilities but threatened military strikes if talks fail to curb Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that Iran was not compliant with its obligations regarding nuclear facilities, leading to condemnation from Iran's Foreign Ministry and the announcement of a new enrichment facility. Trump also cited the evacuation of US embassy staff in Baghdad as a precaution due to the potential for conflict.</p>

          <p>Amid a US-China trade truce, negotiators in London reached a "framework" agreement to activate the Geneva deal, raising hopes for an immediate alleviation of the trade conflict. The agreement may include a US commitment to revoke some tech embargoes in return for China's relaxation of rare earth export restrictions. China's unprecedented tightening of its rare earth exports, impacting US car manufacturers and defense companies, was a key factor prompting Trump to engage with Xi. The London talks may have de-escalated tensions, but significant reorientation of Washingtonâ€™s trade and foreign policy thinking is needed for lasting optimism.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block expansion of what they deem an "unlawful militarization." The request aims to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active-duty Marines beyond protecting federal buildings and property. The Department of Justice argues that limiting the military to protecting federal buildings would amount to a "rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law."</p>

          <p>A growing wildfire in Oregon has destroyed multiple homes and prompted evacuation orders in the Columbia River Gorge area, serving as an early warning for the fire season. The Rowena fire has expanded to 3,500 acres with 0% containment, leading to evacuation orders for hundreds of homes and temporary closure of an interstate highway. Governor Tina Kotek invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act, mobilizing resources to combat the fire, which has already destroyed approximately 20 homes. The wildfire arrives as the US West prepares for a potentially severe fire season, exacerbated by a dry winter and rising temperatures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center, a musical that critiques autocracy and champions the oppressed. This occurred while protests simmered in Los Angeles against his administration's immigration policies, and he mobilized military force to counter them. The event is rife with irony, as Trump's policies often clash with the musical's themes of social justice and resistance against tyranny. Despite the incongruity, Trump has long professed a love for Broadway shows, including 'Les MisÃ©rables,' even using one of its songs at rallies.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has argued that the US could face economic catastrophe if the bill is not passed.

          <p>The Department of Justice has ordered prosecutors to be on alert over the weekend for potential violence at protests. This announcement follows Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Trump defending the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles. Preparations are also underway in Washington for a military parade to mark the Army's 250th birthday. President Trump was met with mixed reactions at the opening night performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center.</p>
