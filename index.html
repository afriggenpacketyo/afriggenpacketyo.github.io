          <p>Alexi Saenz, a leader of an MS-13 clique on Long Island, faces sentencing for his role in a racketeering case involving eight murders and other violent crimes. The case gained national attention for the brutal 2016 killings of two high school girls, which prompted President Trump to call for the death penalty. Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year sentence, highlighting Saenz's sadistic crimes and continued gang activity in prison, while his defense argues for 45 years, citing remorse and a traumatic upbringing.</p>

          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator revealed that the massive power outage and fire that shut down Heathrow Airport was caused by a moisture issue in an electrical substation that was first detected in 2018.

The incident, which affected nearly 67,000 customers and 270,000 journeys, has prompted an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and raised serious concerns about the UK's infrastructure resilience.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twenty states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services over the sharing of personal health data with immigration enforcement agencies like ICE. The suit argues that the Trump administration's policy violates federal privacy laws, including HIPAA, by allowing an unfettered transfer of sensitive information. The states contend that this action creates a culture of fear that will deter individuals from seeking essential emergency medical care, and they are seeking to block any further data sharing.</p>

          <p>Recognizing copper's growing importance for the green energy transition, China is strategically increasing its investments in Africa to secure its supply chain. Chinese companies are focusing on mining and processing facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana. This push is driven by the rising demand for copper in electric vehicles and solar power systems, as well as by Western policies that have restricted China's access to critical mineral assets in other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government suffered a humiliating political defeat, being forced to gut its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a large-scale rebellion from dozens of his own Labour Party MPs. The chaotic episode saw the government make multiple U-turns, drawing comparisons to the parliamentary turmoil of the Brexit era. This event has significantly weakened the new prime minister, creating a multi-billion pound hole in public finances and raising serious questions about his authority and control over his party.</p>

The author argues that by caving to pressure from the Trump administration, the G7 has undermined years of effort to create a fair international tax system and has instead incentivized a race to the bottom. The deal is depicted as a blow to global tax justice that prioritizes corporate profits over the interests of citizens and developing nations. (not investment advice)</p>
