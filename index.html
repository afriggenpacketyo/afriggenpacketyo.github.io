          <p>Charles Borges, the Chief Data Officer for the Social Security Administration, has resigned after filing a whistleblower complaint regarding a massive data security issue. He alleged that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded the entire country's Social Security data to a "vulnerable cloud environment," a claim the SSA refutes. In his resignation letter, Borges stated he faced a hostile work environment and retaliation for raising his concerns internally. His legal representatives confirmed his departure, noting he felt he could no longer work for the agency in good conscience and will continue to cooperate with oversight bodies.</p>

          <p>Global asset managers are growing more optimistic about Chinese stocks as the Shanghai Composite Index reaches a 10-year high. Investment directors suggest that the rally could be sustained by domestic investors moving away from low-yield fixed-income products and by Beijing's focus on technological innovation. The combined US$20 trillion value of onshore and offshore equities is attracting renewed interest from overseas investors, who had previously been exiting the market. This shift indicates a potential for Chinese equities to catch up with other global markets that are trading near historic highs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a significant portion of the tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump are illegal, a decision that could impact his foreign policy agenda. The court rejected the administration's argument that the tariffs were permissible under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that setting levies is a core power of Congress. The ruling, which affects "reciprocal" tariffs on most countries as well as specific tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, is temporarily stayed to allow for a Supreme Court appeal. President Trump criticized the decision, asserting it would be a "total disaster" for the country if allowed to stand.</p>

          <p>Data obtained by the BBC reveals that live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land in the UK since 2023. Of 439 wildfires recorded, 385 were directly linked to army maneuvers, with firefighting efforts often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance. A recent large blaze on North Yorkshire's Langdale Moor was hampered by exploding bombs from World War II-era training. While the MoD states it has a robust wildfire policy, some local residents are calling for a ban on live-fire exercises during the driest months due to health and environmental concerns from the smoke.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States. The court upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful.

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned reports that the Trump administration is planning to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential move an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about the plan and suggested President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker's handling of the city's crime rate. The controversy follows similar deployments of National Guard and federal agents in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., which have raised legal questions about presidential authority over state-controlled Guard forces.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's appearance in a Los Angeles court for a civil assault trial has generated significant online attention due to her candid and animated testimony. The rapper is being sued by a security guard who alleges she was attacked in 2018, a claim Cardi B denies, stating the encounter was only a verbal fight. During cross-examination, moments of courtroom drama went viral, including the rapper's witty responses to questions about her physical state while pregnant and her use of wigs. While some social media users found the exchanges comedic, others questioned if the attorney's focus on her hair and nails carried racist or misogynistic undertones.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes political battle is underway in California over Proposition 50, a November special-election measure that would redraw the state's congressional district maps. Opponents of the measure have already booked over $10 million in television ad time, while supporters have secured at least $2 million, signaling an expensive and intense campaign. The proposition, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to counter Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas and potentially increase the number of Democratic seats in the U.S. House. The opposition includes a diverse coalition, featuring former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who argue for maintaining the current independent commission system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that was previously approved by Congress, according to a White House announcement. The administration utilized a rarely used procedural move known as a "pocket rescission" to withhold funds for 15 international programs near the end of the fiscal year. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who argue it undermines congressional authority and increases the likelihood of a future government shutdown. Some moderate Republicans have also expressed opposition, with Senator Susan Collins calling the action a "clear violation of the law," though the White House maintains it has a solid legal basis.</p>

Consequently, in states like Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico, CVS cannot administer the vaccine even with a prescription due to state-level regulations.

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine indicates that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too soon after their diagnosis. Researchers examined health records of nearly 10,000 children and found that about 42% received a prescription within 30 days, contrary to clinical guidelines that recommend starting with behavioral intervention. Experts note that while medications like Ritalin can be effective, they also carry a risk of side effects such as irritability and emotional problems in young children. The findings call for further investigation into why medication is being used so rapidly as a first-line treatment for this age group.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) will take over security for former Vice President Kamala Harris after President Donald Trump revoked her Secret Service protection. Typically, former vice presidents receive six months of protection, but President Biden had signed an order extending Harris's detail until July 2026. Trump's reversal of this order prompted California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, to arrange for CHP dignitary protection. The move has been criticized by some as political retaliation, coming just as Harris is set to begin a multi-city book tour, raising concerns about the politicization of security for public officials.</p>

Despite calls for his resignation from some lawmakers, a White House official described Kennedy as a "crown jewel" of the administration.

          <p>A performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) at the BBC Proms in London was interrupted when pro-Palestinian protesters stood up in the gallery with signs and began shouting. The orchestra was forced to pause its recital for over ten minutes before restarting the program. A group called Jewish Artists for Palestine claimed responsibility, stating the protest was against what they term "Zionist funding" and complicity in cultural institutions regarding the Gaza war. The BBC apologized for the disruption, which was handled by security at the Royal Albert Hall, while audience members expressed their annoyance with booing.</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced it is reviving the Chevrolet Bolt, an iconic and affordable electric vehicle, for its 2027 model lineup. The original model was discontinued in late 2023, but the company teased its return with the message, "You asked. We listened." The updated version is expected to feature a sleeker design, sharper LED headlights, and a new NACS charging port, making it compatible with Tesla's Supercharger network. The move comes as the EV market continues to grow, with electric vehicles now representing about 35% of global vehicle sales and offering significant long-term savings on fuel and maintenance for consumers.</p>

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than a year, citing ongoing adverse market conditions. The airline plans to continue normal operations during the restructuring, honoring tickets and loyalty points while ensuring employees are paid. Despite emerging from a previous bankruptcy in March, the company has struggled with weak demand for domestic leisure travel and rising operational costs. Spirit has already announced plans to furlough hundreds of pilots and is exploring the sale of aircraft and real estate to secure additional cash as it attempts to stabilize its finances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the urging of President Trump, Missouri's Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional maps, aiming to secure an additional Republican seat in the U.S. House. The proposed changes could reconfigure districts around Kansas City, potentially unseating Democratic Representative Emanuel Cleaver. This move is part of a broader, highly unusual mid-decade redistricting effort by Republican-led states like Texas to bolster their party's majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In response, Democratic states such as California are pursuing their own redistricting measures, setting the stage for a nationwide partisan battle over voting maps.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was sought by the local council, citing planning rule breaches, following protests outside the hotel. However, the appellate judges found the original ruling was "seriously flawed," arguing it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants and risked encouraging further lawlessness through protests. The decision is a victory for the government, which feared a wave of similar legal challenges from other councils, though the local council may appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

She explained her artistic interpretation as being about understanding control and the lack of it, and the humanity of allowing oneself to make mistakes. Amid the controversy, Carpenter released an alternative, "approved by God" cover, but stands by her original vision, emphasizing that she aims to please her fans, not outside critics.</p>

          <p>Director Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," attempts to capture the gritty, anything-goes atmosphere of late-90s New York City but ultimately falls short. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender mistakenly targeted by the city's criminal underworld, but his natural charm makes it difficult to believe he is a down-on-his-luck former athlete. While the movie successfully evokes a nostalgic, grungy Lower Manhattan aesthetic and features a star-studded cast, its characters remain cartoonish and the plot lacks genuine stakes. The film is described as a disposable thriller that prioritizes style over substance, failing to live up to the classic New York crime movies it references.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new congressional map, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, which is designed to add five safe Republican seats and help the party maintain control of Congress. A key element of this strategy involves creating four new Hispanic-majority districts, a high-stakes gamble that the GOP can solidify the gains it made with Latino voters in the last election. However, recent polls suggest some Latino voters who supported Trump are now reconsidering due to the economy and immigration policies. This political maneuver has triggered a national redistricting race, with Democrats in states like California moving to counter the GOP's efforts.</p>

The funding crisis has already led to service reductions affecting thousands of residents, including students and workers.

Officials allege Longoria tried to run down the officers during the initial stop, a claim his lawyers dispute with surveillance video.

Demonstrators in trendy neighborhoods like Condesa have voiced anger over being priced out of their homes, with some estimates suggesting one in five properties there are now short-term rentals. The issue has forced long-term residents to move hours outside the city center, losing what activists call their "right of centrality." While the city's mayor has proposed a plan to regulate rents, critics argue it is too little, too late to address the displacement caused by years of neoliberal economic policies.</p>
