          <p>The European Union is coordinating its response to President Trump's new tariffs, with leaders expressing strong criticism.  While threatening retaliation, the EU prioritizes negotiation to avoid escalating the situation into a trade war.  The EU's dependence on US energy and the desire to maintain a positive relationship with the US complicate the response.  The EU may leverage its large single market and potential retaliatory tariffs on US services.</p>

          <p>Economists predict that President Trump's new tariffs will lead to higher inflation and market instability.  While a recession isn't guaranteed, the potential for retaliatory tariffs and a trade war poses significant risks to economic growth.  The impact on consumers is uncertain, but some price increases are expected. The Federal Reserve faces a difficult policy decision, balancing the need to control inflation with the potential for a growth slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>
