          <p>Lady Gaga performed a free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, drawing over two million attendees and revitalizing the local economy with an expected $100 million boost. The performance was part of a promotional tour for her eighth album, Mayhem, and marked her return to Brazil after a 10-year absence. The city-funded event included a significant security presence, featuring 5,000 police officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras. Gaga, visibly emotional, expressed her gratitude to her Brazilian fans and showcased Brazil-themed costumes, performing hits like Alejandro, Poker Face, and Bad Romance. Fans traveled from across the country, with some queuing early in the morning to secure a spot for the "unforgettable show".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this New York Times article, Ezra Klein reflects on Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president, highlighting it as a defining moment that foreshadowed the structure of Trump's second term. Unlike potential picks like Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum, Vance represented the MAGA movement and accelerationist views. This decision indicated a shift from a coalition government in Trump's first term to a 'royal court' structure in his second, surrounded by loyalists rather than moderating forces. Klein argues that this choice signaled a move away from checks and balances towards a more unchecked, reckless presidency.</p>

          <p>A small plane crashed into two homes in Simi Valley, California, killing the pilot, a passenger, and a dog onboard. The Vans RV-10 aircraft had departed from William J.

The crash resulted in structural damage and fire to both two-story, single-family homes, but residents were safely evacuated without injuries. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash, focusing on the pilot, the aircraft, and the operating environment, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a "commercial transaction" that undermines EU citizenship. The court argued that citizenship requires a genuine link with the country, not just financial investment, and that these schemes pose risks to mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the program's economic benefits, the court's decision highlights the importance of solidarity and shared values within the EU. The ruling may prompt increased scrutiny of "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for investments but raise similar concerns about security and corruption.</p>

With surging support for Reform and gains for other smaller parties, the dominance of Labour and the Conservatives is increasingly shaky.

          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long battle for justice after the murder of their daughter Catina has significantly impacted victims' rights in California. After Catina was murdered by her boyfriend, Steven Burns, her family had to fight to keep him in prison. Harriet Salarno started Crime Victims United, an organization that has changed hundreds of laws. The family's advocacy led to laws allowing victims to give impact statements at sentencing, enabling parents to attend trials even as witnesses, and ensuring children have support when testifying.</p>
