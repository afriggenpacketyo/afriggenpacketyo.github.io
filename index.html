            <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, the lowest since September 2022, in an effort to stimulate the country's slowing economy. This decision aligns with analysts' expectations and arrives as the U.S. imposes tariffs on Indian goods. The RBI cites a softening inflation outlook as the primary reason for the rate cut, expressing confidence in meeting its 4% inflation target over the next year. However, the bank also acknowledges that a challenging global environment is impeding growth, which is currently on a recovery path after a weak performance in the first half of the fiscal year.

            <p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN's shipping agency, is holding talks to establish binding regulations aimed at phasing out fossil fuel use in global shipping. A key proposal involves implementing the world's first global emissions levy, or a carbon credit scheme, on the shipping sector, which accounts for approximately 3% of global carbon emissions. If adopted, this pricing mechanism would be a significant step towards addressing climate change, but its implementation faces challenges due to concerns about U.S. tariffs, a potential trade war, and opposition from some member states.</p>

            <p>Chinese state media declared that China is prepared to “strike back” following the implementation of new US tariffs on Chinese goods. China insists it is still open to discussions with the US, but not under current circumstances. Trump's administration has raised tariffs on Chinese goods by a cumulative 104% since returning to office, prompting China to respond with countermeasures. Beijing views its actions as reasonable and legitimate responses to the US tariffs, emphasizing that they are not initiated out of China's own volition.</p>

            <p>President Trump has announced a sweeping set of tariffs, arguing they will allow the United States to economically flourish. A baseline tariff of 10% on almost all foreign imports to the US kicked in on 5 April, with some countries and goods exempt. Specific reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 of the "worst offenders" have come into effect on 9 April, with China facing an extra 34% tariff in addition to the 20% tariff levied in March.

            <p>A second school-aged child in Texas has died from a measles-related illness amid a growing outbreak, highlighting the dangers of the disease and the importance of vaccination. The child was unvaccinated and had no other health conditions, dying from measles pulmonary failure. The outbreak, which originated in West Texas, has spread to other states and prompted the deployment of CDC teams. Health officials emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and urge people to get vaccinated to prevent further spread.</p>

            <p>Cambodia is facing an existential crisis for its factories and workers due to the 49% tariff rate imposed by the Trump administration, the highest of any country in the new trade plan. Despite the goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., manufacturers in Cambodia are unlikely to relocate there, instead looking at other countries to mitigate the tariffs. No new orders are being placed, and the Cambodian government is working on fiscal policies to alleviate the pressure. U.S. retail companies that import from Cambodia are facing increased costs and uncertainty.</p>

            <p>A surge in sick sea lions, suffering from domoic acid toxicosis caused by harmful algal blooms, are attacking beachgoers in Southern California. The algal bloom, appearing for the fourth consecutive year, has spread along 370 miles of coastline. The toxins affect the sea lions' neurological function, causing disorientation, seizures, and aggressive behavior. Experts emphasize that these animals are not naturally aggressive but are acting out of fear due to their illness, raising concerns among beachgoers and prompting increased vigilance.</p>

            <p>Investment firms are beginning to lower their China growth forecasts in response to escalating trade tensions with the U.S. Citi analysts have cut their forecast for China's GDP to 4.2% this year, citing limited prospects for a deal between the two countries. Natixis has also reduced its forecast to 4.2%, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have warned of increasing downside risks to their current expectation of 4.5% growth. China's official growth target for 2025 is "around 5%," but officials acknowledge that achieving this goal will be challenging.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press (AP) reporters and photographers from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other controlled spaces. The ruling states that blocking AP journalists after the wire service refused to adopt the president's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is contrary to the First Amendment. The judge's order prevents the government from shutting doors to journalists because of their viewpoints. The White House has been given time to appeal the ruling.</p>

            <p>A faulty radio antenna played a role in a mid-air helicopter collision at an Australian theme park and resort that resulted in four deaths. An investigation revealed that the pilot of one helicopter did not hear a vital radio call shortly before the accident, and changes by Sea World eroded risk controls over time. The aircraft preparing to take off also had a faulty antenna, preventing the broadcast of a taxiing call. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau made 28 findings that underline "key lessons" for operators and pilots.</p>
