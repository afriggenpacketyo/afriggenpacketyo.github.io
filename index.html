          <p>Television shows often misrepresent autopsies, leading to misunderstandings and discouraging families from opting for this vital procedure.  Real autopsies are methodical and thorough, requiring extensive personal protective equipment, unlike the often sensationalized depictions on screen. The author argues for increased understanding and utilization of autopsies for medical advancement and family closure.</p>

          <p>Early retirement years are a "danger zone" for portfolio withdrawals during market downturns due to sequence of returns risk.  Withdrawing assets when values are low reduces the portfolio's ability to recover from subsequent market rebounds, increasing the chance of outliving retirement savings.  Experts advise careful planning to mitigate this risk.<br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>

          <p>The European Union has delayed implementing retaliatory tariffs on US goods until mid-April to allow for further discussions with Washington.  This delay slightly adjusts the timeline but doesn't diminish the EU's intended response, which could involve up to â‚¬26 billion in tariffs. The tariffs are a response to US tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.</p>
