          <p>Two survivors of the Nottingham attacks, Sharon Miller and Wayne Birkett, have spoken out for the first time about the physical and psychological trauma they endured after being struck by a van driven by Valdo Calocane, who had earlier fatally stabbed three others. Both Miller and Birkett, who sustained life-changing injuries, express a strong sense of survivor's guilt, wishing they could have traded their lives for those of the victims, Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and Ian Coates. Calocane, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was sentenced to a hospital order, prompting reviews and a public inquiry to prevent similar incidents in the future, with the survivors hoping for meaningful changes. The BBC has refrained from publishing Calocane's picture at the request of the surviving victims.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is publicly advising President Donald Trump against raising the tax rate on wealthy Americans, cautioning that such a move would negatively impact small business owners. Pence argues that most individuals filing taxes of a million dollars reinvest the money back into their companies. He advocates for making the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent to foster economic growth. Pence also credited Trump for his victory in the last election, securing the southern border, and restoring the military, while expressing concerns about straying from conservative principles.</p>

          <p>Fox News co-host Jeanine Pirro will leave the network after being appointed as interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., following the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination.

Her nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, comes with the complication of her being a defendant in the Smartmatic defamation lawsuit against Fox News.

          <p>President Trump has announced that he will replace his controversial pick for U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. Martin's nomination faced strong opposition in the Senate due to his connections to Nazi sympathizers and his legal defense of Jan. 6 Capitol rioters. Trump expressed disappointment over the situation but stated that he would find another position for Martin within the Justice Department. Senator Thom Tillis voiced concerns about Martin's involvement with the Capitol riot, influencing the decision to withdraw his nomination.</p>

          <p>A new culture of informing has emerged in Hong Kong following the implementation of the national security law (NSL), with citizens like Innes Tang reporting dozens of people to the police for alleged violations. Tang and his volunteers monitor social media and operate a hotline to gather information on activities deemed to breach the NSL, which criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces. The Hong Kong authorities have also established their own national security hotline, receiving nearly 900,000 tip-offs. This environment has led to self-censorship and emigration, as many residents fear surveillance and potential legal repercussions.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump has initiated a criminal fraud probe targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James, more than a year after James won a civil fraud case against Trump. The investigation, led by the FBI, was prompted by a letter alleging that James falsified bank documents and property records to obtain favorable loan terms. James has denied the allegations, calling them baseless, while her attorney derided the investigation as political retribution. The probe follows a lengthy civil trial in which James accused Trump of fraudulent property valuations to secure favorable loan rates and insurance deals.</p>

Manhattan federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment, alleging the brothers used force, fraud, or coercion in trafficking the women and the girl, dating back to 2009. The case has shaken the high-end real estate industry and led to the downfall of Oren and Tal Alexander, who had reached the uppermost ranks of a major real estate brokerage.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions squad for 2025 has been announced, revealing significant shifts in national representation. Wales, which previously had a strong presence, now has only two players selected, the lowest number in the modern era. In contrast, Scotland's representation has increased to eight players, while Ireland leads with 15 players in the squad. This shift reflects the changing fortunes of the different nations in the rugby world, with Ireland providing the most players - with Andy Farrell opting for 15 of those he coaches in his usual role as Ireland head coach.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have jointly accused the United States of increasing the risk of nuclear war through its security policies and strategic weapons deployments. The two nations issued a joint statement condemning several US actions, including the expansion of security alliances, development of missile defenses, militarization of space, and sharing of nuclear technology with allies. They warned that these policies seek overwhelming military supremacy, undermining global strategic stability and spurring an arms race. The statement highlights the escalating strategic confrontation between Beijing and Moscow and the United States.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the US will not intervene in the conflict between Pakistan and India, deeming it ‚Äúfundamentally none of our business‚Äù. Vance indicated that the US would seek de-escalation but would not force either side to lay down their arms, aligning with President Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù foreign policy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken with leaders of both countries and called for an ‚Äúimmediate de-escalation‚Äù in the fighting. Vance traveled to India last month, where he said that India could retaliate against ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù in Pakistan but said the US did not want that to spiral into a broader regional conflict.</p>

          <p>India claimed it destroyed an air-defense system in Pakistan's second-largest city, Lahore, leading to speculation that the military equipment was Chinese-made. This followed Pakistan's statement about deploying fighter jets made by China during an encounter with India's air force. The Indian government accused Pakistan of attempting to engage military targets using drones and missiles, which were neutralized. Pakistan's foreign ministry denied launching attacks on India's military installations, calling the claim baseless.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed by Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield Asset Management, accusing the company of fraud and attempted bribery. Raffaelli claims Brookfield mistreated investors in his funds and improperly limited investments in one of Elon Musk's companies. He alleges that Brookfield backtracked on pledges to invest in his funds and vetoed a major investment, limiting potential returns for clients. Brookfield denies the allegations, calling the suit meritless. The lawsuit also claims that Brookfield exaggerated capital levels in a company it was merging Raffaelli's funds into, and offered Raffaelli a bribe in exchange for his help pitching the merger to investors.</p>

This contrasts with previous responses, where minimal intervention was employed.

However, the forceful response has also disturbed those who believe unarmed demonstrators should not be met with force.

This agreement offers relief for key UK industries, although a 10% duty will remain on most goods from the UK. The deal will reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year, which will help luxury carmakers. Tariffs on steel and aluminum have also been slashed, and the two sides have agreed to reciprocal access for beef exports.

Institutional trading volume also fell by 9%. Coinbase expects subscription and service revenue in the range of $600 million to $680 million for the second quarter, but stablecoin revenue growth is likely to be offset by lower blockchain rewards.
