          <p>Susan Monarez has been ousted as the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shortly after her confirmation. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed her departure but did not provide a reason for the sudden removal. The move coincides with the resignations of at least three other senior CDC leaders, who cited concerns over the "weaponizing of public health" and political interference. This leadership shakeup occurs amidst significant turmoil for the agency, including recent budget cuts, layoffs, and a shift in vaccine policy under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>A woman arrested for spitting at a police officer was incorrectly detained for a week due to a series of errors by federal and D.C. officials. Despite prosecutors not seeking detention and a judge ordering her release, Kristal Rios Esquivel remained in jail because of an erroneous warrant flag in the corrections system. A federal judge described the incident as "false imprisonment" and highlighted systemic failures in ensuring timely releases. The case has drawn scrutiny amid the ongoing federal takeover of the district's justice system, raising concerns about procedural integrity and the proper handling of detainees.</p>

          <p>It has been revealed that prolific sex offender Zhenhao Zou sexually assaulted two different women within a 24-hour period in China in October 2022. The first victim, who did not immediately report the crime, expressed guilt upon learning another woman was attacked just hours after her own ordeal. The Metropolitan Police initially questioned if the two identical accounts were from the same person due to the close timing. Zou, who was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting 10 women in the UK and China, is now serving a life sentence, and police fear he may have attacked many more.</p>

The Premier League club suffered a stunning defeat in a marathon 12-11 penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw. Amorim stated his team was "completely lost" and lacked intensity, adding that the defeat marks a new low and suggests "something has to change." The result represents one of the worst upsets in the club's history and erases one of their few realistic opportunities for a trophy this season.</p>

Despite the record-equalling European loss intensifying scrutiny on his position, Martin expressed confidence in his ability to move the team forward.

          <p>In a provocative political move, Republicans in the California assembly have proposed a "two-state solution" that would split the state into coastal and inland regions. The resolution, which is unlikely to pass, is a response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative to redraw congressional districts, which Republicans argue would silence rural and conservative voices. Assembly Republican leader James Gallagher framed the proposal as a necessary step for overlooked regions to gain proper representation. Democrats dismissed the plan as a political stunt and a form of gerrymandering itself, highlighting the escalating partisan battle over electoral maps.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister summoned the senior U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report alleging a covert American operation in Greenland. The operation reportedly aimed to infiltrate Greenlandic society and promote secession from Denmark to the United States. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen stated that any interference in the kingdom's internal affairs is unacceptable, marking a significant diplomatic strain between the close allies. This event follows President Trump's repeated expressions of interest in annexing the semi-autonomous Danish territory, which has caused shock and concern within Denmark.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's recent EFL Cup elimination by League Two side Grimsby Town is being highlighted as one of the most significant upsets in the history of English domestic cup competitions. The Premier League giant lost 12-11 on penalties after coming back from a 2-0 deficit to draw 2-2 in normal time. The article places this stunning result in the context of other memorable giant-killings, such as York City's 3-0 victory at Old Trafford in 1995 and non-league Sutton United's defeat of top-flight Coventry in 1989. The defeat underscores the unpredictable nature of cup football and the potential for lower-league teams to triumph against elite opposition.</p>

          <p>The L.A. City Council has deferred a request for an additional $5 million for the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, which is defending the city in a major homelessness lawsuit. The firm has already billed $3.2 million, far exceeding its initial $900,000 contract, without properly notifying the city as required. The lawsuit, filed by the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights, alleges the city has failed to meet its obligations to provide shelter and clear encampments. Council members expressed displeasure with the unexpected costs and have sent the funding request to the budget committee for further review and negotiation.</p>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV and Fox Corp. have agreed to a short-term contract extension, preventing Fox channels from being removed from the streaming service. The temporary truce came just before a deadline that would have blacked out channels like Fox News and Fox Sports for millions of subscribers. The dispute centers on the programming fees YouTube TV pays to carry Fox's content, with YouTube claiming Fox is demanding unfairly high rates. This extension allows viewers to continue watching popular sports, including the upcoming college and NFL football seasons, while the two companies continue to negotiate a new long-term agreement.</p>

          <p>A Florida official has stated that the controversial immigration detention facility in the Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," will have zero detainees within a few days. The announcement was made in an email from Kevin Guthrie, the head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The facility has been the target of lawsuits, one of which successfully halted the transfer of new detainees to the site. The closure of this center comes as Governor Ron DeSantis's administration announced the opening of a new immigration detention facility in the state, which has been named "Deportation Depot."</p>

The tech giant claims that EU regulations have already caused delays in the rollout of new features for its European customers and that the UK risks similar issues. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is proposing changes to open up markets it says are dominated by Apple and Google. However, Apple argues these rules would undermine user privacy and security, hinder innovation, and force it to give away proprietary technology to competitors.</p>

          <p>With car payments increasingly exceeding $1,000 per month, automotive resource Edmunds has outlined five common mistakes for consumers to avoid. These include buying a vehicle outside one's means, relying solely on dealership financing instead of securing pre-approval, and trading in a car with negative equity. The analysis also advises working with a dealership's internet sales team to secure better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid the steep depreciation of a new car. Avoiding these pitfalls can save buyers thousands of dollars and prevent long-term financial strain in a challenging auto market.</p>

          <p>Universities across the United States are experiencing a significant drop in international student enrollment as the fall semester begins. This decline is largely attributed to a clampdown on student visas by the Trump administration, which has led to long delays and difficulties in securing visa appointments. Institutions like the University at Buffalo are reporting hundreds fewer international students than expected, with a predicted nationwide drop of 150,000 students potentially costing the U.S. economy $7 billion. The situation has created tremendous uncertainty for both students and universities, which rely on international enrollment for revenue and cultural diversity.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing highly likely in September, savers are advised to take strategic actions now to maximize returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). Experts suggest shopping online for the highest available rates, as online banks typically offer better returns than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It is also crucial to accurately determine the amount one can afford to deposit to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Locking in the longest-term CD that fits one's budget can secure a higher rate before they fall, protecting principal and maximizing interest earnings over time. (not investment advice)</p>

The suit was filed not by a survivor, but by the trustee for investors who bought $41 million in church bonds, claiming the archdiocese hid the extent of its abuse liability before the sale. The filing cites investigative reporting that uncovered discrepancies between the church's public list of accused clergy and its internal records.
