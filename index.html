          <p>Over 100 million people across the United States, from Texas to Maine, are under alerts for extreme heat and humidity. Major cities on the East Coast are expected to experience heat indices exceeding 100 degrees, creating dangerous conditions with little overnight relief. The National Weather Service advises residents to limit outdoor activities and stay hydrated, as the sweltering temperatures are projected to persist into the following week, particularly in the Southeast. The article also notes contrasting weather events, such as flash floods and water rescues occurring in parts of Missouri.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its full-year financial guidance following a significant drop in second-quarter profits, attributing the downturn to a €1.3 billion impact from U.S. tariffs and restructuring costs. The company's operating profit fell by 29% compared to the previous year, and it now projects a lower operating return on sales for 2025. Despite these challenges, Volkswagen noted strong order intake for electric vehicles in Europe, highlighting a mixed but challenging market environment for major automakers.

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks has faltered, with a U.S. envoy stating Hamas's response showed a lack of desire to reach an agreement, prompting the American negotiating team to return for consultations. While diplomatic efforts are stalled over conflicting demands, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has grown increasingly dire. The United Nations and other aid agencies report that children are starving to death, with acute malnutrition rates soaring and aid deliveries severely restricted by Israel. This breakdown in talks occurs amidst a worsening crisis that has killed over 59,000 Palestinians and left the population facing famine and disease.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe died by suicide, identifying shortcomings in the mental healthcare he received in the months prior. The court heard that healthcare professionals failed to perceive Thorpe was in a crisis situation, even after being informed he had asked his wife for help to end his life. Despite these failings, the coroner stated they did not amount to gross misconduct. Thorpe, 55, had spiraled into depression after losing his coaching job and died after being struck by a train, highlighting significant issues in his mental health support system.</p>

His reported social awkwardness and obsessive-compulsive behaviors could make him a target, drawing parallels to Jeffrey Dahmer, who was killed in prison for antagonizing fellow inmates. Experts suggest that in the harsh prison environment, standing out can mark an individual as weak and an easy target for extortion or violence.

Trump has denied the note and is suing the Wall Street Journal over its story, while also facing pressure to release the full Epstein investigation files.

He argues that AI's current capabilities are better suited to augmenting tasks rather than substituting entire roles, but the technology is rapidly advancing. Mollick emphasizes that the greatest challenge will be for workers to develop expertise and judgment, as AI may automate the routine tasks through which such skills are traditionally learned. He advises that organizational leaders must articulate a clear vision for AI integration rather than leaving employees to navigate the changes alone.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, conditions in Niger have deteriorated, with increased insecurity and economic hardship. The ruling junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, has cracked down on dissent, shut down NGOs, and severed ties with the regional bloc ECOWAS, leading to significant job losses. Despite initial public support for the takeover, analysts report that freedoms have been curtailed and the space for civil society has shrunk dramatically. The junta's recent move to install its leader for a five-year term suggests a return to democratic rule is not an immediate prospect.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Network Agency has received a record number of complaints about postal services in the first half of the year, up 13% from the previous year's record. The majority of the nearly 23,000 complaints concern market leader Deutsche Post/DHL, with customers reporting damaged parcels, misdelivered mail, and significant delays. Service sector unions attribute the decline in quality to ongoing restructuring and job cuts aimed at saving costs. While the company points to factors like heatwaves and changes in delivery laws, the surge in complaints signals growing public frustration with the reliability of the mail service.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement to recognize a Palestinian state has created diplomatic momentum and placed significant pressure on the United Kingdom to follow suit. The French hope that a joint move by two permanent members of the UN Security Council would restart a meaningful peace process. However, the British government has traditionally viewed recognition as a final step in a negotiated settlement, not a precursor. This decision now poses a political challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who faces growing calls from within his party and from international partners to take a more definitive stance.</p>

For months, the president has publicly called for lower rates to stimulate the economy. This optimistic tone marks a shift from previous rancor between the White House and the Fed, although futures markets do not currently anticipate an imminent rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness tax-free is set to expire at the end of 2025, and it was not extended in President Trump's recent major bill. Without new legislation, borrowers who have their debt canceled under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans will once again face a significant federal tax bill on the forgiven amount. Experts warn this could create a new financial burden for struggling borrowers, as the IRS typically treats forgiven debt as taxable income. For an average IDR borrower, this could result in a tax liability of several thousand dollars. (not investment advice)</p>
